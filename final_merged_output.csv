this video because one, last time I got
invited out to see a cool new Porsche, I
couldn't make it because I had to go to
an ultimate frisbee tournament and Miles
was able to go.
>> All right, I'm here. Please bear with me
for
for a minute. That's true again. This
time it's Portugal for Beach World
Championships, but Miles is out there.
>> I promise this will not take super long.
And two, because the last time Porsche
unveiled a new EV, I was really tempted
to switch.
Almost there. That was a Porsche Tyan
and I had a Tesla Model S at the time.
This time, Porsche's unveiling the new
electric Cayenne.
I swear we're actually almost there. And
you guys may or may not know, I've been
a Rivian R1T person for a couple years
now. Would I switch door number two?
>> And that's an interesting question. It's
maybe not a onetoone analog like the
Tyan and the Model S were to each other,
but a full-size four-seater that's
electric to carry stuff around, carry
people around and daily, especially when
it's garbage weather like this in New
Jersey is really appealing. And and
Porsche does a good job with that stuff.
So,
almost there. Miles, if you don't mind,
break it down. What is the electric
Cayenne? Is it like a replacement for
one of the trims or is it adding to the
lineup? What is the electric Cayenne?
Okay, sorry for the wait, but uh
here it is. Okay, so this is a Cayenne
but electric. But unlike other companies
who are fully replacing their internal
combustion engine models, this is just
an alternative. So if you want the gas
version of the Cayenne, which we have
over there, you can get that. But if you
want the IC version, that's what this is
for. And then there will eventually be
new versions of the IC Cayenne that look
similar to this. But this is the turbo
model, and this is probably the most
different that a Cayenne has looked uh
in a long time. Porsche is usually not
one to make major changes between
generation, but the electric version of
the Cayenne, this is there's a lot going
on here that we we we got to get into
this.
>> Okay, so my immediate question is what
are they going to do with the design?
They could just make it a Porsche
Cayenne but electric and you can't even
tell by looking at it. But sometimes
they do light bars and other fun EV type
of styling stuff. So I'm curious what
type of stuff Porsche is doing. Is it
like a mega tyan or is it just another
Cayenne? So we've seen spy shots of this
car for a long time now, but this is the
unccloaked version. And the first thing
you notice are the new headlights. So
the headlights on the Cayenne have been
getting progressively more squared off
and less rounded off. This is very much
like Tyan. I think if you put this and
the Tyken headlight next to each other,
they would look pretty similar. But the
major thing here are these active arrow
flaps. This is something that we first
saw on the 911 Carrera GTS and obviously
the new Turos S that we just reviewed.
So, we have them on SUVs now. I think
we're starting to see a trend of where
Porsche is going with their design
language. But this isn't just aesthetics
oriented. These are fully functional
active arrow flaps that open and close
depending on your speed and what drive
mode you're in. And then this right here
is functional arrow. You have air that
travels through here to make sure you
get maximum range and efficiency. In the
US, you'll have the option of getting
between a 20, 21, and 22in wheel. We
have the 22s here. You have see the nice
meaty sidewall. But let's actually take
a look at this brake setup right here.
So these are the carbon ceramic brakes.
These are optional for the turbo, but
I'm told that there is an iron cast
brake that you can get that I believe
over 400 mm wide. One of the largest
iron cast brakes you can get on any car,
period. When we get into power, I think
you'll realize that maybe having carbon
ceramics for the turbo model is the
right move, but we'll we'll get into
that a bit later. But this is this is
not a slow car. We'll we'll just put it
we'll just put it that way. I can't show
you this yet because this is an early
model, but behind this is an NACS port.
the very first time that Porsche has an
NACS port built into the car without the
need for an adapter. And because it's on
the left side, this is where you're
going to be doing your DC super fast
charging. And then when you go to the
other side, we have our second door port
as is customary on electric Porsches.
You open that and that is your AC
charger for doing like slower charging
like at home or at at a slower charger.
So, looking at the back half of the
Cayenne EV, this is a a very familiar
shape right here. But you'll notice that
as opposed to on IC versions of the
Cayenne, at least currently, you now
have the active arrow flap up here. And
you can see it go up like that, which I
actually think looks better than what
you have on the IC version of Cayenne. I
I'm so used to seeing like soccer moms
driving their Cayenne with the arrow
wing up at like 20 mph, and I'm like,
what's the point? Uh but then down here
we have the active arrow blades. This is
something that's brand new for a Porsche
having these active blades on like the
side of the car to help aerodynamics and
efficiency. And you can see right there.
So right here are the coordinates for
the wind tunnel in the Weiss factory in
at the Porsche building in Germany,
which is actually pretty cool. It's a
nice little Easter egg. But these will
open and close depending on your speed
and what drive mode you're in. It's I
think it might take some getting used
to, but it it definitely adds to the
sporty like aggressiveness. I could I
could see this being on something like a
GT3 RS and like, you know, whatever
future versions of that car are coming.
I would say between everything like the
new headlights or the three-dimensional
side skirts or all the crazy arrow
features, the wing on the back, the
arrow blades, I think this is the most
substantial design update for the kind
that's ever happened.
>> Okay, interesting looks. I guess the
next obvious question is what are they
doing with the powertrains? Like are
there different levels to the thing?
Because it's Porsche and they do
performance stuff really well. I figured
if I worked at Porsche, I couldn't help
competing with the quickest of these or
maybe Lucid Gravities or R1S's. Surely
there's a turbo. Before we talk about
the interior, let's talk about
powertrains because this man, this is
pretty substantial. What's what's going
on here as far as power upgrades
in the new Cayenne EV? This is going to
be this is going to be a fast car. Let's
let's just put it that way. So, the
standard Cayenne is going to have a
little over 400 horsepower and give you
an extra 20-ish horsepower when you want
to do launch control in that car. Get
you to 0 to 60 in under 5 seconds.
pretty pretty standard stuff. The car
I'm sitting in right now though, the
Cayenne Turbo Electric.
This is getting out of hand. I I just
got to say this is getting out of hand.
This car will be effectively neck and
neck with the new 992.2
911 Turbo S off the line 0 to 60 without
roll out by the way, 2.4 seconds. And
then the 1/4 mile sub 10 9.9. We're
running nines in SUVs now. What in stock
SUVs? What is What is going on? So, this
car is a little under 850 horsepower in
the standard mode. And then when you
click the push to pass button right here
in the steering wheel, that gets you an
extra 173 horsepower. But then when you
want to do launch control, you have a
max output of almost,50
horsepower and,00 lb feet of torque.
This is a monster SUV. And from what I
hear, this is not the fastest one. I
hear there's a a Turbo GT model that's
possibly been seen driving around and
and spy shots and whatnot. So, we
haven't even reached the peak flagship
model yet, and we're already basically
competing with the 911 Turbo S.
So, we'll talk about cost and how much
it actually will cost you to get this
amount of performance. But as far as it
actually being competitive with an R1S
or like a Lucid Gravity, I mean, off the
top of my head, I think that would
automatically make this the most capable
electric SUV out on the road right now.
Maybe the most capable electric car of
just this size out on the road right
now. A sub 10 when this thing's got to
be like 6,000 plus pounds. That is just
Porsche. You Wow. Yeah.
>> All right. I got to know if Porsche has
improved on the range and charging
capabilities on the Cayenne. I say
improved because the Tyan kind of got
away with not being the best battery or
the best range, but that's okay. It's a
sports car. We're not super concerned
with efficiency. But this is a family
hauler. I don't think you can get away
with that anymore. So, did they
>> um we're at 46% right now and we've got
about 139 mi of range. I don't know how
this car has been driven prior to me
sitting in the car, but I mean based on
what I'm seeing here, it feels like
somewhere in the realm of high 200s, low
300s is very much possible with this
car. So, when comparing this with other
high-performance electric SUVs, this is
definitely going to be keeping up with
vehicles like the Rivian R1S and then
the Lucid Gravity. 300 plus miles of
range and 1,000 horsepower
electric SUV, that's not too bad. And
for people who are buying this car,
specifically the turbo variant of the
electric Cayenne, 300 plus miles of
range is going to be pretty usable.
Porsche has been good. Firstly, soft
closed doors standard on every model of
the Cayenne, by the way, which is really
sick. Um, but Porsche has been good
about making sure that their cars are
running on the best possible battery
architecture available effectively. So,
this car is running on an 800vt system
and thanks to that, you should be able
to charge from 10 to 80 using DC
charging and the most ideal conditions
in under 20 minutes, which is pretty
good. Obviously, it's an 113 kWh battery
pack and using DC charging, it has a max
capability of 400 kW charging, which is
obviously, I think, pretty quick.
>> Okay, so I also heard that this car is
supposed to wirelessly charge. Now,
wired charging for a big EV battery is
hard enough, but what is the deal? Is
this supposed to be real? Like for the
whole battery? I understand we'll
probably be able to get our hands on a
version of this hopefully in New Jersey
pretty soon and really test it, but is
it similar to what we saw with like the
McLaren Speed Tail driving over that
puck and then charging a little hybrid
battery or is this next level like
really fully charging the car? What we
have here is a wireless charger. So, the
only other car that I've ever
encountered that has a wireless charging
system of any kind was the McLaren Speed
Tail. We reviewed that car on the main
channel a while ago and that had a much
more complicated, much more expensive,
much more unreliable wireless charging
system. I'll demo it for you in a
second, but I mean, generally speaking,
as long as the wireless charging pad is
connected to either the built-in LTE or
Wi-Fi in your home, you more or less
just drive the Cayenne on and then it
starts charging at up to 11 kW, which is
actually pretty good. So, let's let's
see how it works. So, you obviously have
to step in the cayenne at first.
Okay.
And then you should be able to go to the
charging setting,
inductive charging.
>> Then go and drive.
And then you see here we have these
guidelines, right? And so this is to
make sure that you are actually on the
charger to get the optimal charge
obviously. So then after that you just
drive forward. And then as I'm turning
the wheel here, you can see it
adjusting.
You drive forward, drive forward. And
now we see that green dot to let you
know where you need to land effectively.
So I'm going to turn the wheel a little
bit.
Adjust
a little bit more. A little bit more.
Boom.
And that's it. Hit park.
And then you'll see here on the display
that it should start charging, which is
which is pretty sick. You'll see the
charging speed quickly jumping up. And I
find it pretty impressive how quickly it
goes up to nearly 11 kW of charging.
It's it's pretty much almost there. when
we filmed that speed tail a while ago,
that had a much much more complicated uh
charging sequence where you had a
separate tablet where you had to control
everything and it was just I hear that a
lot of customers actually pay to have
that feature removed and just plug it in
with a cable because it's much more
simple and reliable. This is actually
really cool and from what I've been
told, the pad is weather resistant as
well. So, you could in theory have this
charging pad outside. You could also
back onto the charger. don't have to
drive forward directly onto the charger.
If you're going to do wireless charging
in a car, I think this so far is the the
way to do it. It seems pretty easy. It
seems like the pad itself isn't super
sensitive to environments. So, you could
have it in harsh weather, snow, rain. If
there's like cats underneath the car
that are like messing with the charger
or something, it will, you know,
interrupt the charging speed and power
to make sure you're not, you know,
zapping anything under there. and will
notify you on your Porsche app on your
phone to let you know, hey, just letting
you know the charging got interrupted a
little bit. This is a it's a very
impressive system. I'm not going to lie.
And the fact that this is coming for a
non-hypercar semi-attainable product is
is pretty impressive. All right. Well,
the next question is just about the
general interior. They can do a lot or a
little with it, but I saw some pictures
of this crazy interior with like a huge
curved screen. looked a little
ridiculous in the renders, but I'm
curious if it looks better in person if
you think that's something you'd want to
live with.
>> Let's talk about the interior. So, I
mean, if you sat me in here and didn't
tell me what this was, right, I would
just assume this is a Porsche Cayenne of
some sorts, right? Because of the the
spacing on the inside and all the much
more premium touch points compared to
something like a Macan. But there's some
interesting things going on here, mainly
with the displays, which I'm sure you
can already notice. First thing, we have
a curved gauge cluster, which is brand
new for the Cayenne. And it's actually
pretty subtle. I mean, when just looking
at the gauge cluster from my point of
view, you notice it, but it's something
your your eyes kind of get used to in a
matter of seconds. This, however, is a
bit different.
So, there were some photos of this car
online when they did the initial press
release for the Cayenne Electric, and I
think to certain people, it wasn't super
uh appealing visually speaking. I talked
to Porsche about this, about why they
decided to go with a screen like this
for the Cayenne, and apparently this is
a result of kind of amalgamating a bunch
of customer feedback. So, I mean,
obviously you can't have buttons for
every single thing, right? And
thankfully, we still do have buttons for
the important stuff. We have our volume
right here. Okay, radio still on. And
then we have our temperature control,
uh, you know, windshield, automax, all
that fun stuff, right? And then for the
seats, you have the ventilation button,
the heating button. I I just swapped
those. I don't know why, but you have
all that stuff ready and accessible. But
apparently customers wanted buttons for
the important stuff but wanted less
points of interaction. Meaning they
didn't want two screens. They wanted one
screen. They wanted as few screens as
humanly possible. So as opposed to doing
two separate screens, they just decided,
hey, let's just do one screen and then
make it curved. And so you have
basically the the bottom half of the
screen here to control uh like things
like the menu and kind of hit certain
different menus in the car. And then up
here is where you're going to have like
your CarPlay and things like that. Or
you hit this button and you can control
the the frunk, the trunk, the uh
charging ports, things like that, which
we'll we'll have to talk about the frunk
and the trunk a bit later. But uh to be
honest, using it, I'm not like
horrifically offended by this screen. To
be honest, it's not too bad. I think it
just takes a minute to get used to. And
I mean, I really don't want to know how
much it would cost if you like crack the
display or something like that. But, uh,
I mean, it's not as bad as I think the
photos would imply it is. But, as far as
curved displays go, I think this is one
of the better implementations of it. And
it doesn't feel awkward to use. I guess
that's what I was like worried about is
that using this would feel awkward, but
it it it doesn't. And then we also have
this new LED light strip on the
dashboard that is not only aesthetic,
but it's functional as well. So, we have
like these mood modes here. So, if I
change my mood mode, you'll see the
color change on these LED strips. But
these LED strips are also for functional
purposes as well. So, when you're
climbing onto your wireless charging
pad, I don't know why I said climbing
on, but when you're driving onto your
wireless charging pad, it'll blink to
let you know what's going on. Or when
you're receiving a phone call or things
like that, it'll kind of blink to let
you know what's going on. These are all
little things in which uh the LEDs are
doing to become more useful and not just
for aesthetic purposes. So, the LED
strip new. Even the design of the power
button on the left side, that's new.
Gauge cluster new. Screen new. So, this
button layout is new. We have new cup
holders. This center area right here is
slightly different compared to a
standard Cayenne. But generally
speaking, they didn't do too much to
stray away from what we know and love
about the Cayenne. From an overall vibes
perspective, this very much feels like a
Cayenne but electric. And I think that's
that's what we want. Okay, firstly,
let's look at the trunk because I
actually haven't seen that yet in
person.
Have our hatchback open in here. And
this is a decent amount of space. And
obviously, you can fold the rear seats
back if you want even more. But this is
this is I think plenty. I could see
myself stuffing a full set of wheels and
tires back here for sure. I'm sure if
you fold the seats down, you can get a
bike back here. Pretty solid roominess
in the back. This is actually better
than I was expecting. Let's see if
there's any additional storage down
here. Just a little bit. So, this is
where you would presumably keep like
charging cables and whatnot, but
honestly,
not bad at all. Let's take a look at the
frunk cuz I'm actually very curious to
see what roominess on that is like.
And wow. Okay, so the first thing I'm
noticing is that while there's not a ton
of space overall, it's very deep. Like
my hand is very far forward into this
thing. Pretty much my whole arm is down
in here. So, it's it's pretty deep,
actually. So, this wouldn't be big
enough to fit something like a full
carry-on suitcase. I think it's just a
little bit too small for that. And I'm
not seeing any ways to remove this stuff
right here. But, I mean, I think that's
solid. And I mean, that's better than a
lot of electric SUVs on sale which don't
even have a frunk. Like the Cadillac
Vistic that we just reviewed or the Jeep
Wagon Ear S that we just reviewed don't
have a frunk in the front. This is
actually pretty solid all things
considered. Well, then the magic
question is how much are these new
Porsche SUVs going to cost?
Because let's be honest, Porsches
typically aren't uh the cheapest or most
valueoriented options. But, you know, if
you're cross shopping this against like
a a Rivian R1S or even a Lucid Gravity,
if it's in the same price range, that
makes sense. Is it in that price range
or or if not, what other things are you
crush hopping it with? Okay, time to get
to the not so fun part. So, how much are
these things going to cost?
Well, it's a Porsche, right? So, it's
not supposed to be the value option, but
the base Kayen electric starts at a
little over $100,000, almost $110. And
then this one right here, the turbo
electric, starts at almost $165,000
in the US. So, when comparing like the
base Cayenne to other electric SUVs you
can get on the market that aren't
performanceoriented, that's where things
become a little bit more competitive,
unless you just have to have the Porsche
badge, right? But I mean, honestly, when
you consider how powerful this car is
and how presumably well it's going to
drive,
163 compared to like a fully loaded
Lucid Gravity or a fully loaded R1S. I
mean, that's not that's not a terrible
Porsche tax. Obviously, there's a
Porsche tax there, but it's not the
worst. Now, if they said this thing is
starting at a quarter mil, well, okay,
that's that's that's a lot. But I mean,
I think there's objectively from a
performance standpoint things that the
Turbo Electric is going to be doing that
things like the Lucid Gravity and the
R1S simply will not. So, I mean, in some
ways, I think the Turbo model is the
more competitive car compared to its
counterparts, more so than the base
Cayenne Electric is competitive compared
to everything else you can get in that
price range. So, my last question, and
maybe it's the most important one, is,
is there anything that you saw in this
static walkound that would make you
think that a currently gas car driving
person would actually switch? Like maybe
you were interested in the gas Cayenne.
Is there anything you saw that would
make you think that person might switch
and go, ""Okay, I'm going to get that
electric Cayenne now."" Cuz that would be
pretty sick. So obviously as the entire
world makes the long road of
transitioning into EVs from internal
combustion engine cars, there's going to
be things that manufacturers are going
to be doing to try to sweeten the deal
in convincing people to transition to
something like that Turbo GT over there
into this Cayenne Turbo Electric.
Although it's good that you have both
options, but what are we seeing here
that's actually making it a convincing
argument to maybe switch from something
like an Aston Martin DVX or a
Lamborghini Urus or, you know, a Cayenne
Turbo GT into something like this? Well,
I mean, first things first, the power,
right? There is simply no other SUV on
sale that is going to hit 0 to 60 in 2.4
seconds. Even the Rivian R1S quad motor
that you know we took to the dragstrip
even though that was the R1T technically
but more or less same car. That car was
close but didn't quite get that 2.4.
Porsche says this hits 2.4 without roll
out. And when Porsche says that that
means it is true. You're also going to
have things available for this car like
the active ride system which is
something that debuted on the Panamera
that gives you really excellent body
control and makes the ride quality
absolutely superb. And then things like
wireless charging. I think that's
something that makes it a lot easier to
not have to think about charging your
car when you get home, even if you have
a charger at home where you could
literally just drive on and it's more or
less completely thoughtless. That's
something that I think definitely
sweetens the deal. And theoretically, if
you don't commute a ton, I mean, you
might never really have to go to a
public charging station if you have
something like this at home. So, I
haven't driven this car yet besides just
driving it back and forth to put it on
the wireless charging pad. So, I can't
say whether I would theoretically switch
to something like this from a Cayenne
Turbo GT, which I don't own anyway. But,
I mean, on paper, it's looking it's
looking pretty good. And I mean, this is
Porsche's's not first electric SUV, but
it's their first attempt at throwing
everything uh at the kitchen sink and
really providing a flagship Porsche SUV
experience in electric form. Everything
from the proposed propulsion numbers to
the range. You got NACS active ride is
going to be huge. Everything on paper
looks pretty good. And so I guess we'll
have to find out if this ends up being
the sum of its parts, more or less. But
Porsche has my attention for sure. And
so the next step will be getting this at
the studio so we can drive it, review
it, and really see if it lives up to
what I am calling hype because I'm
pretty excited to drive this car now.
Now that I really got to take a look at
it in person, the design doesn't offend
me a bunch. Um, it's not my favorite
looking Cayenne ever, but it's far from
the worst. Uh, but yeah, thanks to
Porsche for letting me check this out a
bit early, and uh, hopefully we'll be
driving this one soon. All right, I'll
talk to you guys in the next one."

this video by saying that I actually do
have a bit of a soft spot in my heart
for Jeep. The first car I ever drove and
actually learned to drive with and got
my driver's license test with was a Jeep
Grand Cherokee. It was a hand-me-down
for my dad from his dad. Uh, and it was
special. It was a little bit modified
because my grandfather liked to modify
cars a bit, but like that was what I
learned to drive with. That was what my
the beginning of my car journey sort of
came from. But then I didn't really
drive too many Jeeps since then. I'm not
really in their target demographic. But
now fast forward to 2025 and I feel like
I've seen that there's an electric Jeep
somewhere, right? Like I never see it on
the road. I don't know why people don't
buy them, but I I feel like they have an
electric one. So I looked it up and they
do. And we got it here to test.
And well, now I know why we don't see it
very much. Because this is it. This is
the electric Jeep. It's the Jeep Wagon
Ear, which is a little bit confusing
because if you know anything about
Jeep's lineup, the Wagon Ear is like
much bigger and this kind of feels like
a Grand Cherokee again. But nonetheless,
this is a fully electric dual motor
all-wheel drive EV. It has around 600
horsepower and plenty of torque. It also
has roughly 300 mi of range and starts
at about $70,000. And you would think
that a Jeep is another one of those
perfect candidates of a car to go
electric, right? I talk about this all
the time. Oh, there's a car that's heavy
already and expensive already and quick
already and you just want to make it
heavier and more expensive and quicker
and make the best version possible.
Okay, a Jeep with the best traction
control from being electric, with the
best all-wheel drive and the most torque
from being electric, this should be the
best Jeep ever.
But it feels like when they made this,
they just they just weren't into it.
They just didn't care about the idea of
making the best Jeep ever.
Let's get into it. Now, when you start
on the outside, it is actually pretty
promising, right? They they actually
take a lot of the classic Jeep lines and
shapes and did modernize them and made
them look like they're still a Jeep, but
the electric version, right? Like this
grew up front that they always do these
these slots in. There is no real air
flow through these because it's
electric, so it's a lot smoother and it
cuts through the air more
aerodynamically, but you've got a light
bar and it's that's still very much a
Jeep, so that's nice. Uh the sides here,
you've got these arrow covers on these
wheels. Somebody curbed it. It wasn't
me, the person before me maybe. Uh, but
then from the side, it's got this sort
of a fastback sporty look, which I
actually kind of like. And the reason
you have that is this big spoiler up at
the back here. This is kind of nice.
This little arrow wing feature with this
fin at the top. And then it still has
plenty of trunk space. So, the shape and
the outside look very much still EV.
Charge port is back left. So, if you
ever want to know if it's the Wagon Ear
S, bam, that's the logo. And oh, it's
locked. Okay, good opportunity to show
you the keys. This is the key. This is
how you unlock it. And this is how you
pop open. Not an NACS port, but a CCS
port still. Maybe some I kind of doubt
they're going to make an NACS version,
but that's the charge port. So, okay,
the sporty Jeep thing on the outside
still lives on. Thumbs up. The designers
cooked. Let's see if uh the interior
people cooked as well. So, we've got
these aerodynamic lack of a door handle
here. You just pull open. They are not
soft closed, but that's okay. We'll pop
inside. And this is a nice interior.
Look at all this this red leather and
all these nice surfaces. Let's fire it
up. It's still a Jeep with a power
button. So, we fire that up here.
Launch edition. And now we're in the
driver's seat experience. Okay. So, I
actually did recently drive an actual
Jeep Wagon Ear. And this is nothing like
that. Like I I don't know why this is
called the Wagon Ear. really feels like
a Grand Cherokee. It's much smaller
around and it drives totally different.
But yeah, this interior I think is the
nicest thing about this car. These
ambient lights get really bright and if
you leave them on at night, they're
actually a little distractingly bright
and I have to turn them down, but they
go all the way around the cabin. You've
got this red leather and this is a nice
comfortable massaging heated andor
ventilated seat. Then in the middle
here, well, first of all, there's a
screen up here that does wireless
CarPlay. You've got the screen behind
the steering wheel, which is nice and
big and round, but then there's also a
little bit of extra storage space in
here with charge ports. You've got that
HDMI port. There's a second screen for
the passenger, which you can turn on or
off with this button right here, but
that's also polarized, so you can only
see it if you're actually sitting in
that seat, which is good. Doesn't
distract me. I like that this isn't
piano black. It's got this sort of
texture here. And this is how you
change. I don't like the gear change
being like a a rotating thing. That's
kind of I'd rather have something a
little more solid. Uh, but there's your
mode changer. So, your auto, your sport
mode, two cup holders, your wireless
charger, and some more storage in there.
So, this is this is a nice place to sit.
It's got these Macintosh speakers, and
this is the first time I've tested a car
with Macintosh speakers, and they're
nice. They are definitely nice. They're
like a minus tier, really, really good.
You can tune them with the software of
the car itself. Very impressed with the
speakers. And it is a quiet place to
sit. Oh, and uh this is a camera. So, if
you don't want to use this actual mirror
here because you got people behind you,
you can use the camera for your rearview
mirror. And a nice big sunroof above me.
Like, this is this is a nice place to
be. But it keeps going cuz these
interior designers were actually
cooking. So, I'm going to get in the
back seat. Again, this is behind a 63
driving position. And there's a really
good amount of storage here. So, I mean,
I say storage, but this is just where I
put my feet under the seat. Seats are
nice and high up. These are ventilated
and heated rear seats. Again, a ton of
this red leather and this speaker system
and all the ambient lights back here.
This is a nice place to be. I mean, road
tripping, I would be very comfortable in
the back of the Jeep. And even with all
this size and all this extra room for
the passengers, there is still Where's
the button? There it is. There's still a
good amount of trunk space, like a lot
of trunk space. It's not a three row, so
all of this room is uh cavernous, I
would say. Uh there is actually even a
little bit of extra. I don't think they
want you to use this, but
there's a little bit of extra sort of
sneaky hidden storage down here. But
even without that, like tons of tons of
groceries, tons of golf clubs, tons of
equipment, whatever you want. Put those
seats down and put bicycles in the back
if you want to. There's tie downs. This
is nice. Oh, and I forgot to mention, I
guess I'll just put this up here. Uh,
fullsize outlet down there as well. I
don't know why I'm going out of order,
but I think you can tell I'm pretty
impressed uh with the interior of the
Jeep Wagon Ear in terms of quality and
build and materials. This is a nice
trim, obviously, and it's 70s
something,000, so it should be nice.
But then you have to drive it and you
have to live with it.
And that's where I feel like it falls
apart a little bit. I don't think I
don't think those engineers cooked very
much on this car. So, here's why I say
that. I think that the electric version
of the Jeep, like I said at the
beginning of this video, should be the
best version of this Jeep. It should
have the most power. It should have the
smoothest ride, the best instant torque,
the best traction control. It should be
the quietest. It should be the nicest.
The one thing it does do is it is very
smooth, right? Like the suspension, it
rides really nicely. This is something
they they're not super sporty. They ride
extremely comfortably and the seats are
nice. So, I'm comfortable riding in this
car. That's no problem. Uh, but what
I've noticed is they're missing a lot of
the other upside of going electric. And
I I don't actually know what platform
this is built on. It feels like there's
no way it's a groundup EV, but also I
think it is. I think it's maybe based on
the charger, the electric charger, but
like so many things are remaining from
gas cars. Like, okay, I think some of
it's on purpose. The power button. EVs
don't need a power button. You could
just put your foot on the brake and
start driving, but they've left the
power button to make it feel like you're
turning it on. Okay, fine. That's
allowed. But this huge center console
with with no storage inside, is this
really necessary in a in a groundup EV?
Surely you could save that space. Even
let me show you something else. In the
back seat, did you notice there's still
a hump through the middle? like as if
there's a a drive shaft going through
here. This is just electric motor at the
back, electric motor at the front. Why
Why is that still there? And I know not
every EV has a front trunk, but you
know, maybe if it was a groundup EV,
they would have a nice big space at the
front, which would make it the best Jeep
ever. Um, but that's
that's the front trunk. I mean, it's
it's like a backpack and a half, maybe.
So, they they weren't really too focused
on a usable front trunk. I don't think
people are going to use that very much.
But then on top of all that, you start
to drive the thing and even the
drivetrain. There's there's a programmed
in. So again, some of this is on
purpose. They want it to feel like a gas
car and it's nice and familiar, but
there is a noticeable lag when hitting
the accelerator pedal. In auto mode,
I'll hit the you could flatten the
accelerator pedal for a split second and
experience zero acceleration. That's
true. That's how much lag there is in
this car in auto mode. Now, you can get
rid of some of that by going to sport
mode, and then it's a little bit more
responsive with the torque, but it
doesn't fully remove the lag. So, there
is always lag, believe it or not, even
with a car that could have instant
torque. Uh, and then the traction
control is also,
I guess it's lacking in this car. You
can break traction in a straight line in
auto mode from a low speed in this car.
You flatten the accelerator and it it it
lights up the tires. And I think part of
that is because it has 600 horsepower
and it's also riding on these nice thin
efficient tires to try to get a lot of
range. These are only 235 section tires.
They're not very wide. So this big thing
with 600 horsepower on 235s,
yeah, it breaks traction in a straight
line, which maybe maybe that's fun, but
I don't think most people are actually
looking for that in their their Jeep
carrying their family around. And then
this is one of only two vehicles I've
ever really noticed this in where if I'm
going over a big enough pothole or a
manhole cover or a hump in the road or
something like that and I am in the
middle of a braking event, it thinks
it's lost traction or lost connection
with the ground and it pulls braking and
then reapplies brakes when it thinks it
has connection again. So I'm I'm
breaking. This can feel dangerous. I'm
breaking. I go over a big bump and the
car lurches forward and then stops again
even though my foot has been on the
brakes the whole time. The only other
car I've experienced that in is the
Fisker Ocean. So obviously that's not a
good precedent. I don't feel safe all
the time when I'm breaking in this
family hauler. That's that's very
strange. And again, this electric one
should have the best traction control.
But I think because they put it on 235s
and because they're trying to make it
feel like a gas car with this built-in
lag, it's really not feeling very
comfortable. Also, it doesn't have that
much range. I know it's 235s and and
really efficient tires to try to get a
ton of range, but I've never seen a
number that starts with a three for the
range on this car. In November in New
Jersey, I'm getting 270 mi of range. I
think it might touch 290 on a good day
driving in a chill way in eco mode.
mission not really accomplished there, I
don't think. So then you combine that
with the $70 plus,000 price tag
and it starts to feel like it's not
worth it. Like there are lots of other
EVs you could get, Mustang Mach E for
example, right, that do all the same
stuff, have all the same space, but just
are more comfortable and feel like a
more complete EV, more storage, better
range, and and just a better packaging
overall.
So, yeah, as much as I wanted to love
this Jeep because of the soft spot that
I have for a Jeep and what I finally
remember from Jeeps of the past, uh,
this this is not the one to get, I don't
think. I mean, they're going to put
incredible lease deals on it and maybe
it'll feel reasonable then. But if
you're going to buy this for $75,000,
don't do that. Just don't do that. But
yeah, maybe in a in a second attempt
they'll get more of the pure EV
experience stuff right. Until then,
we'll see what they get up to. Thanks
for watching. Catch you guys in the next
one. Peace."

before, so this won't be a surprise, but
there really is only one car on this
planet that I fully, wholeheartedly, and
unabashedly love, and that's the Porsche
992.1 911 Turbo S. Uh, it's the car that
I've been daily driving for the past 2
or so years now. I've reviewed this
thing. I love it. I have almost only
great things to say about it. But
Porsche did something very interesting.
They uh they just unveiled a successor
to this car, the 992.2 two turbos and
it's a hybrid. Now, they invited us out
to Spain to check it out, but I'm busy.
I'm going to nationals for Ultimate
Frisbee in San Diego at the same time,
but Miles isn't busy. So, Miles is going
to go to this event in Spain. So, Miles,
if you don't mind, I have a few
questions as an owner of this car about
the new one. Yeah. So, uh, I am here,
uh, to test out the new 911 Turbo S and
find out on Marquez's behalf if it's a
car that is worth upgrading to and
really seeing where this mountain peaks
with electrification in the 911. There
it is right there. Let's uh, let's dig
into it. What do you got for me?
>> All right. So, I guess the perfect place
to start is the new powertrain, right?
This is the headlining new feature. So,
just just to give us the on paper specs,
what is new about this Turbo S versus
this 3.8 L flat 6 that we've come to
know and love? Okay, so in a surprising
turn of events, the engine has actually
gotten smaller. Your car has a 3.8,
technically 3.7 L flat 6. This is now
using the same 3.6 L flat 6 found in the
GTS, but there's a huge difference. This
now has two electrically powered
turbochargers as opposed to one in the
GTS. So, as you can imagine, power has
has gone up just a a wee bit. We're now
looking at over 700 horsepower 0 to 60
in the low twos. And that's all thanks
to those two turbochargers, plus an e-
motor in the gearbox. Um, this this car
is not not slow. Um, and we'll we'll
dive into that a bit more later, but uh,
pretty substantial, if not one of the
most substantial.1
tot power increases in the Turbo S's
history. It's pretty crazy. Okay, so
this thing's clearly going to be quick,
and we'll get to that. But that's just
on the inside. I'm curious about the
outside of this car, cuz frankly, I love
the outside of the 992.1. I think it's
perfectly understated and I know they
don't change 911s much from year to
year, but I'm curious if there are any
actual or noticeable aesthetic
differences about a1 update to this 911.
>> So, aesthetically, there aren't a whole
lot of changes, but by far what's most
noticeable are these active arrow shark
fins that are also on the GTS. So,
pretty much the exact same thing copy
and pasted onto this car. And that's
effectively it for the front of the car.
But then when you take a look around
back, you'll notice that the diffuser
has been tweaked a bit. This is a new
diffuser design that was not available
on 1 Turbo S992. And we also have this
new take on the exhaust tips. This is
one of two options you can get for this
car. You can get the standard ovular
exhaust or you can get this kind of more
traditional quad exhaust setup. Uh I
think I like the ovals a bit better, but
this has its own look to it as well. I
don't dislike it. And the rear tail
lights are slightly different. But other
than that, aesthetically it's the same
car outside of the, you know, T hybrid
badges cuz Porsche has to let you know
this is the hybrid one. This is this is
the one that go fast. Okay. Pretty
specific question, but I've seen
different things in different places.
So, uh, that car you're driving, what
tire is it on? Cuz I've seen, you know,
all those like promo videos and
everything. It looks like they're almost
always on a Pirelli PR.
But when I play around on the Porsche
Configurator, lately it's been a little
Michigan logo on the side of the tire.
So, what what tire is it?
>> Now, while I do love Michigan, I got to
say I love Michelin a little bit more.
Sorry, I had to poke fun at you for
that. Uh, yeah, this car is running the
Pirelli Perrs. Now, I do prefer Michelin
tires. I think that's just the goated
option if you can get it. But these
PZRs, I think they're they're perfectly
fine on this car. It handles the weight.
It grips well. It allows you to achieve
a pretty solid 0 to 60, which we'll
we'll get into. Um, but so far that's
what I've got on this car. There are
other press cars floating around in
Spain right now that may have different
options, but more than likely they're
rocking the PZRS. So, one of the
absolute best features in these cars up
until this past generation has been a
little touch of analog in the turnkey
start and the real tachometer. Let's
give that a
>> [music]
>> Doesn't get better than that. But those
are gone from the new Turbo S,
unfortunately. Are there any other new
things about the interior, though?
>> So, we're going to have to pour one out
for the turnkey start and the analog
tachometer in the 911 Turbo S. It is
gone. Now, we have a fully digital gauge
cluster now in the 911, as well as no
push to start or no turnkey to start.
Uh, that's in the GT3s thankfully. So,
if you want a GT3, that'll be the one
car with turnkey to start. But the
gauges are going to be fully digital for
every car from now on. And let's just
take a look at it.
So, this is like the fourth or fifth
Porsche I've driven with the fully
digital gauge, maybe sixth or seventh
when you include Macans and Cayenne as
well. And I'm I'm starting to get used
to it more and more day by day. It
certainly isn't as cool as the analog
tac in the middle on the previous car. I
would still consider it a downgrade, but
I understand where people are coming
from as far as not being able to see all
the gauges with having the analog one in
the middle. And this is just far more
customizable. You can do so much more
with it. And I understand why Porsche
went this route. Um, it's just one of
the many little things that Porsche is
doing to kind of eliminate that classic
Porsche experience, which is a bummer,
but I'm not I'm not mad at it. And I I
in practice, I think it's the better
move. But having the analog tac is
cooler. But other than that, layout is
effectively identical to what you have
in the 1 Turbo S, which I think is great
because I don't think anything needed to
change. I don't think anything needed to
change with the steering wheel. I don't
think anything needed to change with the
center screen. I don't really think
anything needed to change with the
center console layout either. You have
all the buttons for all the necessary
stuff. Exhaust, traction off, uh your
suspension settings, everything that you
need to have access to is still just as
easily acceptable and accessible. Sorry.
And uh that's that's the way we like it.
That's that's definitely the way I like
it.
>> Okay. Well, it is a Porsche 911 after
all. So, I suppose the most important
question is how does it drive? And you
know, we did review and check out that
GTS. The 992.2 refresh of the GTS is
also a hybrid, but it's one huge
electrified turbo. And this 911 Turbo S
is twin turbo. And there was way more
torque down low in like the 2 to 3,000
RPM range. Kind of felt almost like an
electric car with how much poke you had
at those lower speeds. But talk to me.
Does this car drive better than the GTS?
How does it feel?
All right. So, right now I've got the
car in sport plus mode and I'm in some
pretty technical uh Spain country roads.
Uh lots of tight turns, not a whole lot
of open straights, but just enough for
me to really get a sense of uh I mean
how exactly powerful this car is. Coming
from the 992.1, which is already a very
powerful car, [sighs and gasps] it's
actually kind of shocking how much
quicker this feels. I mean, 700
horsepower is always going to be a lot
of power no matter what kind of sports
car body you throw it into, but
just the way this thing takes off like
an absolute rocket is it's it's
phenomenal. The weight, right, that's a
huge thing with this car. And uh I gotta
say, despite the fact that it's, you
know, almost knocking on 4,000 pounds,
you don't really feel it a ton. And
that's because of something that
Porsche's implemented with this car,
it's called EHPDC.
Basically, electro-hydraulically powered
Porsche dynamic chassis control, which
basically means the sway bars are
electro-hydraulic now. And uh that's
really helpful for taking this car into
corners. That's where you're going to
feel the weight the most when you're
moving it from side to side. Does it
feel like a heavier 911? Yes. Although
it doesn't feel that much heavier than
the GTS. It does feel heavier than the
GTS. But I do think any 992.1 owners are
going to get in this car and notice.
Yeah, there's a there's a shift in
weight for sure. And uh I mean it really
depends on the type of guy you are. I
mean some people buy this car as a daily
to go fast in a straight line
occasionally. And so if that's what
you're going to be using this car for, I
don't think the weight really makes a
difference when we're talking about this
amount of a weight gain. But for track
use, for just pure enjoyment and super
dynamic situations, it might not be as
enjoyable as prior 911s that are just
smaller and lighter. That's just what it
is. But regardless, this is a really
really excellent car to drive given the
stats, given the numbers. And I'm I'm
barely pushing this car. I'm not really
familiar with these roads, so I'm not
trying to go too crazy, but [sighs] it's
it's so excellent. And not to mention
very comfortable. So much more
comfortable than the GTS. That's
something that's probably one of the
biggest takeaways is how much more
comfortable this is to drive, even in
the sportiest setting, than the GTS is.
So, I have a feeling that this car, this
refresh is going to be competitive for
the new YouTube Drag King title. And I
remember Miles, before you flew out
there, you were talking about how you
think this might be sub 10sec quarter,
sub 2C 0 to 60. I wasn't so sure. I
mean, I see 200 extra pounds on the stat
sheet, and I see 50 more horsepower or
so, but I'm curious if you feel now that
you've driven it that this could be the
new YouTube Drag King like this car was.
So, I was wrong. You can't do 0 to 60 in
under 2 seconds. At least with the
current setup and on the street, it
seems like 2.4 is the best that this
specific car is capable of. But I mean,
what what are we talking about here? 2.4
seconds. That I mean, that's that's
that's nuts. That's
I mean, as far as I'm concerned, I do
think that this is probably you could
call this the new YouTube Drag King. I
don't think that there's going to be
many cars that are going to be able to
keep up with this in a straight line off
the line. You know, once you get past
the 1/4 mile,
that's a different story. But, I mean, I
think this is for sure a sub 10 car in
the quarter. and 0 to 60. Maybe you can
do under two with the perfectly ideal
spec, perfectly ideal conditions. But
unfortunately, we couldn't get that
today. But I mean, the fact that I'm
saying unfortunately we couldn't get
less than 2.4 seconds.
I mean, I think that that sentence
speaks for itself.
>> H Okay, this may be too specific of a
question, but I feel like Porsche people
may appreciate your answer here. You and
I have driven the hybrid GTS from this
year and with the prices going way way
up of all these cars, you know, that GTS
was really quick, really powerful, it
feels like just as quick and fun as this
stock Turbo S was. Is there a real
difference between the new GTS hybrid
and that Turbo S hybrid? Like, is the
fun factor higher? Is there really
enough to spend that much more money or
should people just get the GTS?
So, I guess the biggest thing that has
surprised me with this car in terms of
driving, because it's more or less what
I expected, which is a good thing, is
how much quicker it feels than the GTS.
I really didn't think the gap would be
as wide as it is. It's It's a wide gap.
I mean, this thing, especially when
going from like second gear and giving
it like 80% throttle, this thing is just
monstrous. It's demonically fast. It's
It's absurd quite [laughter] frankly.
And so I guess the benefit of having
that speed with the hybrid setup is that
it feels like you're taking advantage of
it more as opposed to turbos of the past
where you feel like you kind of have to
really really be pushing the limits as
far as speed to feel like, yeah, I'm I'm
in the supercar because you didn't have
that instantaneous throttle response.
Now, I mean, this is as close as we're
going to get to EV like acceleration in
a 911. It truly is that explosive and
that much more explosive than the GTS,
which was already a very, very fast car.
Steering is excellent as always. The
hybrid system hasn't ruined that. The
PDK transmission is excellent as always.
The hybrid system hasn't ruined that.
Straight line speed,
it it does that. I I think it does that
pretty well. handling despite the weight
is
it it's it'll do. It'll do. I think I
wouldn't have said this about previous
versions of 911, but I kind of just look
at this as a better version of the GTS.
You've got the same hybrid setup. It
just goes significantly quicker. It's
more comfortable to drive yet still just
as dynamic as the GTS.
I think this is this is a this is a
proper upgrade if you're coming from the
GTS for sure. I think it just does
everything the same but better. Unless
you just have to have rear wheel drive,
there's not many advantages of going
with the GTS over this.
All right. Well, I guess there's only
one more question and uh it might not
have a real answer, but you can try
anyway.
owners of this car, the 992.1 Turbo S, I
don't think you need to upgrade. I think
there are some nice minor improvements
and if you have to have the latest and
greatest thing, you already decided to
buy this car. But how far back should
you go before thinking that this is a
real meaningful upgrade? This brand new
2026 Turbo S. As Porsche stacks a bunch
of tiny incremental improvements year
after year, how far back do you go
before you go, ""Okay, this is a real
serious upgrade.""
>> You're right. I don't think that this is
a necessary upgrade for 992.1
owners. I think you're perfectly fine
with the car you've got, unless you just
really want to experience a hybrid. But
I feel like if you weren't sure after
driving the GTS that you wanted the
hybrid version of the car you do have,
then I don't think this car is going to
change much for you. But what we should
do is get this at the studio so you can
really find out for yourself. I think if
you're driving a 991.2
car or prior, this is going to be one of
the most transformative upgrades you can
make from generation to generation for a
911 that you could ever do. Everything
about electrification when it comes to
this car is just improving all the areas
in which this car was just slightly
lacking. Mostly just low down torque,
being able to punch out of corners with
the highest amount of acceleration. It's
just such a capable car despite it being
nearly 4,000 lb. They're getting heavier
and still somehow handling better than
the cars that came before it and being
faster than the cars that came before
it. 0 to 60 in the low twos and still
being able to take it to get groceries,
drive it on a dirt road in the middle of
nowhere in Spain, you really can do
anything and everything with this car.
So, just like most Porsches, there's
there's practically zero compromise. And
I think if you're okay with the tech
changes that are being made with the
inside, if you're at a 991.2 and prior,
this is going to be a really phenomenal
upgrade. It's It's the 911 Turbo S, man.
It's the king of the hill for a reason.
And while these cars are getting
continually more expensive, like for
example, this one is about 283 with just
a couple of options and you can spec
them well into the 300s, maybe even
close to 400 if you tried. There's a
reason for that. Many of them being
economical, but the other half of it is
that there's not much you can compare
this car to. And so some people are just
going to continue to be able to justify
owning a 911 and buying a 911 because
it's just it's just that good. So,
that's that's about it. Thank you to
Porsche for uh letting me have it go.
And uh subscribe if you want to see us
drive this car at the studio in Dirty
Jersey. That's about it. I'll talk to
you guys in the next one. Peace."

would say, because the car that I'm
about to review
isn't out yet. A lot of talk about why
it should be out and why it could come
out soon, but it's not out yet. But the
idea of it is really appealing.
400 miles of range on a fully electric
car with a lightweight battery that only
weighs 2200 lb total and that has solar
panels to get you up to 40 miles per day
of free driving and a starting price of
$35,000.
Who wouldn't want that?
Oh, but it also it looks like that. So,
I've had people sending me this car,
sending me this website, sending me
videos of this thing for years and years
now. Marquez, you should check out the
Upterra, the Abtera project. It's going
to be real soon. It's coming out soon.
And while that part hasn't happened,
there has been some noticeable momentum
for the company getting to production.
Uh, and that's still not guaranteed, but
they were actually able to get this car
here to let me be the first outside of
Atera to drive it and really get to know
the thing and figure out if the idea is
good or not. Spoiler, I think the idea
is really good, but there are so many
things about this car that are just very
different from a normal car. And we got
to go over all that stuff cuz as Doug
would say, there are quite a few quirks
and features and driving it should be
pretty interesting, too. So, let's just
first of all cover what it is. So, this
is a fully electric vehicle cuz it's not
a car. This is actually going to be
licensed and registered as what's called
an auto. So, you might have heard of
these, these little three- wheeled
vehicles that are around that are
essentially the same rules and
regulations and insurance and
registration as a motorcycle, which is
why it has a motorcycle uh license plate
here on the back and none on the front
and even this little light, which is
required by law to illuminate that
motorcycle size license plate. You don't
need a special license in the US to
drive it though. And that battery, which
is 41 usable kilowatt hours, is mostly
distributed along the bottom of the
thing. And then there are solar panels
on the roof. They're on the back trunk
part here. They're on the roof of the
whole vehicle up here. They're on the
nose cone up at the front here. And
they're actually also right behind the
steering wheel or yolk in that dashboard
inside the car.
And so all of that is combined to get
you roughly 400 mi of range base is what
they're promising. And then all of these
solar panels all over the vehicle are
supposed to have it gain roughly 4 1/2
kwatt hours of range per day in ideal
sunny conditions like these. Uh
something like 40 mi max range per day.
So, if you commute less than 40 total
miles a day and it's sunny every day and
you park outside, you can drive this for
free. Now, those fundamentals, I think,
are appealing to a lot of people, but
there's also, as you can see, looking at
it, just an unbelievable amount of of
quirks and features and weird things
about this to achieve that. Sorry, Doug.
I kind of have to use that term. But
basically starting from the nose, you'll
notice the whole thing is designed
around efficiency and aerodynamic
efficiency is maybe the most important
when it comes to cars. So this front
piece here, which has your DRLs and your
blinkers and even your headlights, this
is the beginning of where it cuts
through the air. No front plate because
motorcycles and autocycles don't require
that and that would ruin the air flow.
And the air just sort of flows around
the entire shape of this teardrop
vehicle from front to back. And you can
see this long extended back here. I
don't know if you remember the video I
did on the Mercedes EQXX, which is
another similar project from Mercedes
who has infinite resources to try to
make the most efficient possible vehicle
they can. It also kind of had that long
teardrop shape. So the whole thing is
supposed to glide through the air like a
teardrop. You have this elevated rear
section. The wheels are all covered.
Obviously, you'd get a lot of dirty air
flow over the wheels. So, it's got this
this sort of air foil here. Even over
some of the suspension pieces, they've
made some aerodynamic adjustments here.
There's lights on the wheels, which are
separated from the extremely aerodynamic
body. You have really slim side view
mirrors, which have cameras on them. And
you might also notice there is no door
handle on the outside anywhere, which
brings us conveniently to one of our
biggest quirks/features, which is this
door. Okay, I'm going to I'm going to do
it from the driver's side cuz I think
it's pretty crazy what they're doing
with the doors here. First of all, first
of all, split window. You see the bottom
half of the window here, which moves up
and down, and the top section, which
doesn't move up and down. Second of all,
the doors go up and out. So, kind of
like spider doors. And third of all, how
do you get in? There's no door handle.
Well, that's easy. There's a secret
knock right about here.
And that opens the door to reveal the
inside. So, yeah, they go up and out.
And you right away get a look at all
this forged carbon fiber because this
vehicle is built of a couple of really
large pieces of forged carbon fiber. The
body itself is one of the biggest pieces
of forged carbon fiber in the world. And
then this whole thing is like a top
piece, a bottom piece, side pieces, the
doors, a lot of forged carbon to be as
light as possible. So that's going to be
really interesting when it comes to
driving the car is just to keep an eye
on like the visibility of the split
window and the things like the tiny
rearview mirrors on the side. But
another little quirk/feature is that
right there is your windshield wiper
fluid. if you want to fill it up because
you don't get to open the hood, you got
to go right back there. But then there
is this whole back piece which obviously
is great for aerodynamics and you can
see the brake lights here. But there are
more crazy features. First of all,
there's that center wheel. Less rolling
resistance in the middle and more
aerodynamic with less dirty air being
only one wheel. Says a terra back there.
And this motorcycle plate also
conveniently moves over to the side to
reveal the charge port. And yes, that is
an NACS charge port. So, you can go to a
Tesla Supercharger if you want to when
this is out and you should be able to
plug it right in with no adapter. And
the magnet snaps it back in place, which
is crazy. But then this is also storage.
So, if you want to get in the back,
there's another secret knock. You might
have seen a video. It's right around
here. If I get this right. Yep, there we
go. And that lets you get into the back
of the Terra with way more exposed
forged carbon fiber. That looks kind of
sick actually, not going to lie. This
whole top piece is super lightweight cuz
it's carbon. And then you have all this
storage in the back, which is honestly a
ton. Like a lot of storage. It kind of
reminds me of that big Cadillac that we
had not too long ago, which had a ton of
space that kind of just goes right up to
the front two seats. So there you go.
You have storage space in the back of
the Upter. Now, some other design
choices back here. You have one of the
speakers, probably the biggest one. I'm
guessing the subwoofer. You have a power
outlet, which is a good spot for it if
you're going to charge bigger stuff. And
you have all these tie downs. So, if you
want to tie down bigger things to not
sort of slosh around back here, that
makes sense. And then back here, there's
a little bit of a sub trunk storage
because the middle wheel is up there.
So, you can put some private things, I
guess, if you don't want people to know,
back here. And then this whole thing
with that hood latch shuts
just like that. I think it's
fascinating. I've seen a lot of videos
and photos of this thing, and it's
really hard to get a sense of the scale
of it. The width of the body itself is
not very wide, and you can see these
brake lights here and this cool
heart-shaped top rear brake light with a
rear-facing camera up here. But then
when you add the extra width of the
front wheels, it's closer to the width
of a full-size car like a Tesla Model S,
for example. And so as you're driving, I
think you're going to have to keep an
eye on the extra width being beyond the
normal, you know, rearview mirror in the
door. You get a little extra width with
these wheels. Now, just a couple more
things before we get in. One, uh, all
these different solar panels are all
facing different directions, obviously.
So, as you charge throughout the day,
you know, in the morning, if you're
facing the sun, it's these front ones
that will do you the most good. Then in
the middle of the day, the roof, and
then maybe the back when the sun's up
there. Um, so you're never charging all
the solar panels to max capacity at
once. But interestingly, they're curved
a little bit, too. So, typically glass
and solar panels like on rooftops are
pretty flat, but that is a curved
surface. And that roof, you can see, is
curved as well. And then that back is
even a larger piece with all these
curved solar panels in it. So, that's
pretty cool. And then there's your logo.
And then, well, we should get inside.
So, let's go ultra wide here. This is
how you get into the Upter Terra
in the Yolk steering wheel.
And this is what it will look like in
the driver's seat. So again, I've seen a
lot of videos. I've seen a lot of
pictures online, but it's hard to get a
sense of scale and what's going on here.
I'll also mention, and I probably should
have said this earlier, this is not a
final vehicle. This is a development
prototype. This is what they hope to
send to validation. And it's nearly
finished, but a lot of these things are
not fully complete. There's some 3D
printed parts and some unfinished
suspension and things like that. But
this should give us a good idea of what
it's like for customers to live with
this thing, which starts with this big
wide yolk right here, which has a horn
button.
Nice. And a volume up and down on the
left. No play pause. I thought they
would also have like a play pause
control, but that leaves you some good
visibility of this screen in front of
you, which is just for your side view
mirrors. So, let's close this
door here. And you can see that's my
side view mirrors, which is good because
visibility wise,
can't really see over my shoulder very
well here. So, that's that front screen.
Then over to the middle is your primary
screen. They said they aim to have Apple
CarPlay and Android Auto support which
will be in this window over here to the
right. But until then, there are really
no other major buttons in this car.
There's the hazard button which is I
think required by law. But then even
these lights and everything else you do
in the car uh is operated on the
touchcreen. So you have this center
console storage space which is nice. Uh,
and you have these two cup holders in
the middle here, a place to charge your
phone, and then I believe there will be
not diagnostic ports, but two USB type-C
ports in the middle here. But then even
things from like AC controls to window
up and down
are
all on the touchcreen in the car,
everything. So, as I look around, as I'm
sitting here, it's not it's not totally
unfamiliar. I mean there's some normaly
about it. It feels like the size of a
small car. The way the windshield is
shaped, feels like a small twodoor
coupe, but then obviously behind me
there's a whole lot of nothing right now
because there's no visibility. And so it
should be working in the final vehicle
ideally, but they're going to go full
camera to see behind you with that
camera that I showed you that's on the
back of the vehicle. And so you have all
your closed storage space back here. I
think they even might have made some
accessories to let people like camp and
sleep in the back. I don't know if I
would do that without any sort of
windows, but that's a lot of space back
there. And then I also noticed that
these split windows have a pretty big
border to them. And that border is right
around eye level for me. So, as I look
out the window, I'm basically looking
right at this split window. And then
over my shoulder, I got to look at the
cameras. Other than that, sun shades,
pretty good headroom, good leg room. I'm
sitting on batteries, so I'm actually
not too low to the ground. This is good.
I've also noticed that the AC is coming
from vents around this screen, which is
kind of funny. All the way around is
where the AC is popping out. Nice. So,
you know, I can't do too much analysis
of things like how comfortable the seats
are cuz they could not be final, but you
know, these are cloth and have a pretty
interesting design and they feel fine to
me. Also things like the glove box over
here or this extra little documents
compartment or the width of the footwell
or you know how good the speakers sound.
I can't pair my phone to it. A lot of
this I can't really analyze because it's
not final and it's not even necessarily
good in a prototype yet. But the idea is
this is an extremely minimal interior
efficiency, simplicity, even easy to
repair ideally. Uh, but that does mean
things like uh the lights that are above
you, the dome lights are on the
touchcreen. The windows up and down are
on the touchcreen. That's crazy. Your
park, reverse, neutral, and drive are
all touchscreen controls. And so there's
there's a lot going on on the screen and
they're going to have to have pretty
good software, but also, you know,
CarPlay and Android Auto support would
be nice to have. Now, you know, my
initial reaction to any car like this is
it feels so clearly built around nice
weather, like nice weather regions. Uh,
I'm going to get out by pressing this
button here, which lets me open the
door. Uh, but similar to when I had that
Prius, one of our most popular videos
ever on autofocus, the the solar panels
only do you a lot of good if you live in
a sunny place where you get a lot of
sunshine during the day. And a car like
this with knocking on the side to open
the doors is not going to be great in
some place that gets icy or snowy. Uh,
and even these big covers on the wheels
aren't going to do you much good when
there's more than about 3 in of snow.
So, this is going to be good for, you
know, your Californiaiforns and your
warmer climates where it doesn't
necessarily ice over and snow as much.
But in those places, I mean, I get it.
It feels like a really compelling idea
to make the world's most efficient
100watt hour per mile EV and sell it as
cheaply as possible and hopefully make
it repairable and customerfriendly in a
lot of places.
But then you have to drive something
that looks like that. Is that going to
be weird? Is that going to be
challenging? Do we have to get used to
it? This is a good time to start
driving. Let's do it. All right.
driving the Aera.
>> First first people to ever drive it.
>> Did you think this was ever going to be
a real thing? Did you?
>> No. That's a sentence that I did not
expect to ever say out loud.
>> And this soon, too.
>> 2025.
>> Right off the bat, it's two doors. All
the storage is behind us. You can see
there's no rear view. This would
typically be a camera. It's not working
right now, but that would be how you
look backwards, which is not totally
unique. We've seen that in some other
vehicles. My blinkers are on. There's no
sound, but
>> but that will be coming at some point.
>> Yeah, I think that's the theme of some
of the experience is it's not finished
obviously, but this is giving us a
pretty good idea of what it'll be like.
Visibility is forward pretty good.
>> Yeah,
>> sideways.
>> Noting the split window is not
incredible, but it is a window
>> controlled only by the screen as well.
>> Yeah, no buttons for that. rear
visibility like my rear 3/4 I just have
to use the cameras.
>> That would be a blind spot for me.
>> And this is a pre-production validation
vehicle. So the overall driving
experience isn't 1,000% representative
of what the final production version
will be according to Aterra. But it's
>> more or less a version of the car that's
usable enough for us to uh like evaluate
basically. For example, they mentioned
they have another version that they're
doing more suspension development on.
So, this is not a final suspension. It's
a little rougher, but
>> yeah,
>> we're driving it.
>> Yeah. It is interesting, though. This
It's a weird amalgamation of like
different vehicle concepts. It's like
it's a tricycle.
>> Uh-huh.
>> But you can use it as a car. It It's a
hatchback.
>> It's a lot more storage than a
motorcycle. Like actually a respectable
amount of storage.
>> No, like you can genuinely fit a lot of
stuff in there. Normally when you drive
a car, you're thinking like the width of
the car ends right here and maybe like
the width of the window.
>> This one you got to think a little bit
more about the the extra width of the
wheels sticking out.
>> So I can I can see them. It's fine. I
know I'm not on the lane lines, but
that's something to keep in mind,
>> which is good.
>> Not being able to see them would be very
uh misleading. I
>> If you were a little shorter, that would
be tough. Yeah,
>> I think that's going to be a theme of
this ride is uh people wondering what it
is.
>> So, he's he's like gesturing to like be
like like fly, go fly. Now, one thing
that I'm not crazy about is the footwell
space that I've got. It's very narrow.
>> So, it's like my my feet are almost
touching
>> because of how narrow this space is.
>> Interesting. The Atera team didn't
mention this being a not final thing.
>> So, I'm not sure if this will be
comfortable for people of all different
sizes and heights
>> and and shapes. It's a little awkward
for me right now. It feels like cuz
normally you have more uh horizontal
space for your your feet to move around
in within the cabin, but other than
that, I mean, it it is it's fine. It's
comfortable. These aren't the most
comfortable seats I've I've sat in, but
>> I've sat in worse, you Yeah, seats are
right. They're cloth seats. We've got I
would say my my footwell space is also
okay.
>> Yeah.
>> So, a little shallow.
>> I will say this is probably one of the
most chill, peaceful carbon tub cars
I've ever been in.
>> So far,
>> I mean, even the Remont Nea that we
drove, there was a lot of chatter, a lot
of like rock chip noise. I feel like
that was just a noisier car than this.
>> I think that maybe because of how much
wider the wheels typically are on those
cars,
>> like just picking up stones, cup twos,
throwing them up in the wheel wells. But
I agree. I mean, this feels
>> reasonable. I wouldn't think too hard
about like, oh, this is the lightest
thing I've driven. The steering ratio is
is a little it's super slow and light,
so I feel like I'm doing a lot of
movement for not a lot of turning. that
they can change that obviously, but
>> um it does feel like they're tuning it
to be a little more like a daily Civic
type of experience, nothing too like
sporty.
>> And that's what they said. They said in
any scenario in which you could drive a
Honda Civic, you should be able to drive
>> this car.
>> I have an interesting comp.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. A little more regular roads.
>> Yeah,
>> it's firm. Yeah, it's definitely firm.
>> That's fine.
>> I mean, we're not super low to the
ground, but it is it is firm.
>> So, the car is pretty small and pretty
low, but you are sitting on top of
batteries, so you're not feeling super
low to the ground, which is nice.
>> And I think we'll we'll have to wait
until we get into higher speeds to to
truly find out. But I mean, I think
people see a car like this not
understanding how like things like a
carbon chassis work and they'll think,
""Man, there's no way I could drive this
where I live. If I got into an accident,
I would be smooshed. I would be
destroyed."" Does it actually feel like a
notsafe car? To me, I feel I feel fine.
>> Yeah. Like heightwise off the ground and
like enclosure-wise,
I feel surprisingly safe. I see this
thing from the outside and I did not
think I would feel that way.
>> Yeah. And now I feel like I'm just in a
small car. And that's just the way small
cars feel.
>> Yeah.
>> All right. Now we're moving.
>> All right. First real
>> above 30 mph test.
>> Yeah.
>> How does it corner?
>> It's a bit wy.
>> The front Yeah, the front is is wide
enough that you feel planted. Obviously,
the back is still one wheel, so you can
only do so much, but
>> Right.
>> Nothing too dramatic.
>> Yeah. the pedal response is. So, this is
a front-wheel drive.
>> I don't even know what the horsepower
rating is, but
>> it does have the quick torque. Not like
instant punch, but it has a quick torque
>> of uh of an EV, so you feel like you can
place yourself on the road pretty well.
>> Yeah.
>> What does your butt dyno tell you? Cuz I
mean, based on the range and the 0 to 60
claim, I would guess it's probably
somewhere around high 100s, like 200. It
feel that was wide open throttle. I
don't know if you even noticed.
>> So, I would say that felt closer to like
the 200 horsepower number.
>> Oh, no.
>> It is.
>> Yeah. What? 2,200 lb.
>> Yeah.
>> Wide open throttle. Yeah. I don't want
to spin anything. Yeah. It's like
good enough to to place myself among the
cars on the road. It's not It's not
quick. So, you don't feel like it's too
slow to the point of like not being able
to survive amongst other East Coast
drivers?
>> No, I would say it's not too slow for
that.
>> Okay.
>> If you want something sportier, they're
going to make one that also has a motor
in the rear, which will make it
all-wheel drive. It's three wheels, but
it's all-wheel drive.
>> And that may get a little more punch.
That may do a
>> a quicker 0 to 60. And
>> for those who want it, great. But yeah,
this is the most efficient version of
this vehicle. Frontwheel drive, cutting
through the wind.
Feels fine. Yeah,
>> I need the Aera RS with with a 285 rear
section.
>> Oh god.
>> Yeah, it's a sunny day in New Jersey. We
are gaining a little bit of battery as
we drive. Not gaining battery, but we're
gaining some energy.
>> Yes.
>> From the sun, even as we drive right
now.
>> One thing I was nervous about is
watching you go through the toll booth.
>> Yeah. because of the width of it.
>> Yeah, the width of it and not like
having a the clearest idea of like where
each side of the car ends.
>> Yeah.
>> But I think I was in the middle there. I
felt like I was good.
>> Yeah. I think if you just go based on
instinct, you'll be you'll be fine. So,
even just based on riding shotgun, it
feels like a car that you don't really
need to learn how to drive if you
already know how to drive a regular car.
>> Yeah. And so despite being such a
completely different take on this kind
of transportation, it's it there's
really no learning curves
>> for general stop and go.
>> I I thought I would notice the rear
being one wheel more. I mean, I notice
when I'm turning and thinking about it,
I can feel the weight distribution,
>> but like you don't need a special
license. It's a it's basically a
motorcycle. Yep. Uh it's registered as
and it's insured as a motorcycle, but
you just have a regular license and
you're good to go. And I think that
tracks I don't think it's it's
dramatically different in the way it
behaves. Nope.
>> Which is a good thing. So now that we're
on like a regular driving road, it it's
pretty smooth. I feel like you can get
used to the actually the I know it's not
final, but the calibration of the
accelerator pedal is pretty good. So I
can modulate my speed really well.
>> Yeah, it feels smooth as a passenger.
>> Okay. One thing I will say, this has
happened more than once now. When I'm
driving at the right angle and the sun
is in front of me,
>> the sun reflects and glares off of this
dashboard worse than any glare dash I've
ever seen in my life.
>> It literally blinds me to whatever's in
front of me. And they that they got to
figure that part out cuz
>> that could be dangerous actually. Like I
know that that's a good amount of like
solar coverage and you want to maximize
coverage, but because it's basically
reflective glass and it's at an angle.
It's if you're driving the right
direction, it's literally blinding you.
So that I don't think they can keep
that.
>> So what do we think is missing from this
driving experience that
could actually be improved and doesn't
compromise on the mission
of this car slash tricycle?
Um, most of my things I'm noticing are
are little things. They definitely took
a minimal approach to the interior,
which is efficient and repairable, but
also it means everything from the AC
controls to the the window controls and
everything, it's all on the screen.
>> Yeah,
>> I don't love that. that I would rather
have a window switch and a door lock
switch, but uh other things are just
kind of like minor and aesthetic. I
think in general they've they've gotten
the fundamentals down, which is
encouraging. I don't know how hard that
is in building an EV.
>> Yeah.
>> But they did do the fundamentals.
Accelerator pedals calibrated.
Suspension is good enough that I don't
feel like I'm swaying even though
there's only three wheels.
Um, they do need to add a blinker sound.
>> Yes.
>> That right there. That Did you get the
glare there?
>> Yep.
>> Oh, yeah. Right. Yep.
>> I briefly could not see what was in
front of me.
>> Wow.
>> And it's a good thing we're turning cuz
it was brief, but
straight line roads sometimes that's
going to be challenging.
>> Yeah. Other than that, it's got the one
windshield wiper.
It's got quirks. It's got features.
cameras are are decent, but they look
like kind of the first gen Rivian
cameras which are like magenta tinted
and not very high resolution.
>> Yeah, I'm I mean resolution I think it's
usable. I've seen worse even in some
cars like the 911.
>> But it's just very dim. That's kind of
my issue with it that I just can't see
it that well on an average sunny day.
>> You know what's funny? It's, and this
might be a weight thing, like it handles
the bigger bumps better than I expect
>> and it handles the smaller bumps worse
than I expect.
Like whenever we get a like a huge
pothole, we'll go through it and I'm
like, ""Oh, this rides really well."" But
we go over some of those like paint
lines on the road and I'm like, ""I can't
believe I can feel that.""
>> Yeah. And as feel it as much as
>> as we do. Yeah. Overall, I'm I'm I'm
curious to see where this is where this
goes. I I mean just the fact that we
went from this is never going to be real
to we just took it to Wawa and plugged
in a
>> a Tesla supercharger cable. I mean, it
wasn't actually charging, but the fact
that we were able to do that, I mean,
>> now I'm kind of just looking forward to
seeing where where this uh mountain
peaks. So, I want it to exist. And I
we've talked to the people at the
company who have told us something I've
heard and read for over a year now,
which is roughly 50,000 pre-orders.
>> Mhm.
>> Why do you think there's not more? Like,
it's 100 bucks to get in line. It's only
a $35,000 vehicle potentially to buy.
Everyone seems to be interested in it
when they see it and hear that it
charges with the sun. Like, why why
isn't more? I think people are into it
when they see it, but I don't think, you
know, they haven't had a super strong
marketing push for this car yet. Um, and
so I think once it gets in front of more
people's faces, I think then we'll see
an uptick in the amount of people that
actually want to put their money behind
this potentially. But I mean,
>> it is compromised in very specific ways
that would make it hard to live with
>> in certain regions. in certain regions
like here. And so there's only going to
be so many people in California that
want to spend $40,000 on this versus a
Tesla or, you know, an EV6 or or
something along those lines.
>> Yeah. Norm equivalently priced efficient
standard EV.
>> It's interesting. I think my my theory
is that it it's different and that's
what's getting all the attention. It's
maybe too different to get people to
commit to buying it.
>> But it is interesting enough that it
could potentially push the industry a
little bit, which is exciting.
>> Yeah. I think if you're just looking for
practicality and to do something
different and not spend a a ton of money
on an EV, because a lot of these EVs are
very expensive and not giving you a
whole lot for that money as far as
usability. Yeah.
>> I think that's where,
you know, this car might have a pocket
to to sit in. All right. Well, give it a
year. See where we're at. Yeah. Check
back in.
>> Yeah.
>> Thanks for watching. Catch you in the
next one. Peace."

glow-ups for new products that nobody's
really talking about for some reason. I
would like to nominate Kia with this new
EV6. This is nice. They've done a lot of
good stuff here. First new glowup is the
new front end. Okay, so these new
headlights, they've grown on me, but I
think they look nice. This whole front
end has been redesigned. But the second
glow up is the battery. So the first gen
had a 77 kWh battery. This has grown to
now an 84 kWh. So, the GT line, which is
the one I have here, will do well over
300 mi, which is nice. But then third
glow up is this is an NACS port now. So,
you can plug into Tesla superchargers
with no adapter needed and charge in a
ton of places. You still get this light
here, which indicates how full you are,
and it's still a motorized charging
door. Nice. But then the fourth glow up
is on the inside, which is wireless
CarPlay and Android Auto. I don't know
why it took him so long, but it's
welcome. But then the fifth glow-up is
this updated interior styling. It feels
a lot more premium and visually
interesting on the inside now. This new
dual tone steering wheel is cool. And
this new wireless charging pad on this
floating armrest is ideal. So yeah,
shout out to the new EV6. If it wasn't
already on your radar with all this glow
up, now it probably should"

lot of cars, one of the most common
questions that I actually get is, ""What
are the best non-Tesla electric cars
that I could buy?"" And I always like
making videos about like answering the
most frequently asked questions, but if
you'd asked me to make this video like
10 years ago, it would have been a
really short video. I would have said,
""Nah, good luck. The Tesla is the EV you
should buy.""
But now it's 2025 and Tesla still makes
a great product, but with them opening
up the supercharging network and lots of
other competition getting way more
popular and way better, now there are
way more alternatives that are actually
worthy of considering. So, in the
fiveish categories that Tesla makes a
vehicle, I'm going to actually give you
my top five, no, top three alternatives
to Model 3, Model Y, Model S, and Model
X. and Cybertruck. And this is the video
that I'm gonna send to people who ask me
that question. Also, me standing in
front of this new facelifted EV6 and it
not making any of my lists. The irony is
not lost on me, but this is a good
runner up. Anyway, let's get into it.
Okay, let's start with uh Tesla's most
popular vehicle, their best deal,
Tesla Model 3. So, Model 3 buyers are
looking for, you know, a pretty
reasonable compactish four-door sedan
they can take friends around in. good
range, efficient, nothing too fancy. So,
my top pick, and I've reviewed this car,
actually, actually, I've reviewed every
single car that I'm about to talk about
in this video on this channel, so you
can go back and watch them, but I'll say
my top pick for this is the Hyundai
Ionic 6. The six is uh basically the
same range as a Model 3. It's about 320
mi. Uh the new one in 2026 is going to
have an NACS port, so you can plug in
without an adapter into a bunch of Tesla
superchargers. The design,
you know, some people might like it,
some people might not. It looks like
kind of a baby Porsche from certain
angles, but it's also a little unique.
Definitely have to like the look of it
to spend the money on it. But it has
CarPlay andor Android Auto if you want
that, too. Unlike a Model 3, of course.
Cheap used ones, like you can get a good
clean title used one for like 20 grand
now. So, that's a good deal, a good
range, a good reliable EV, and as long
as you don't mind the looks, that's my
top pick. Now, to round out my top
three, I have two cars that I think are
a just a little bit more interesting
than the Model 3. Something that I hear
also a lot from people about why they
don't want a Tesla is because there's so
many Teslas on the road that just feels
like another one of the cars everyone
has. So, I'm going with Polestar 2. This
is not a very common one. It's not even
the best deal, but it is definitely more
interesting. It's very similar, you
know, super plain and high-tech
interior. You can get a used one for 20
grand. And I happen to really like the
exterior design of Polestars a lot. Uh,
but they're not the most practical. I
will also say Volvo EX30. I really like
the Volvo EX30. I think it's way more
fun to drive. It has CarPlay and Android
Auto, and you can get one in the range
of 40 grand uh used. They're they're
pretty new still, but it is a smaller
EV, more compact back seat, a little bit
more environmentally friendly materials
on the inside, but just a little bit
more interesting than a Model 3. So,
that's my top three Model 3
alternatives. Now, next up, Tesla has
the Model Y, which is literally I think
it might still be the most popular
vehicle on the planet. So, obviously,
there's a lot of them and it is popular
for good reason. It's really good. It's
a really good deal and uh wouldn't shock
me if most people decide to get one of
them anyway. But, if you want an
alternative to one, my top pick is going
to be the BMW iX. So, we're thinking
Model Y, two rows, obviously, but a
little bit taller, a little bit higher
off the ground. BMW EX is very similar
size. Also has a very similar 300 plus
mile range, but if you don't want to pay
Model Y performance money, it is a bit
of a a sportier ride and a general
sportier feeling interior. Uh, it's not
the prettiest thing on the outside, but
they did refresh the exterior, so it
looks pretty good, too. I think the
suspension is a little bit better. And
yeah, it's going to have a lot of the
same upsides in terms of space and a
simple, modern interior. plus CarPlay
and Android Auto. So, you can find used
EX's around the 40 grand mark for a
clean title one. Now, my second on this
list is is actually one of my favorites
I reviewed a long time ago when there
were almost none of them on the road,
and I called them underrated. Cadillac
L. So, the Lyric is what you get if you
want a more premium interior version of
the Model Y. The Model Y is super clean,
obviously, but the Cadillac interior
does it much nicer. Uh, it has better
sound dampening. It has better uh seats,
I think, and it also rides a bit better.
It's a bit softer. So, if you want that
softer ride, Cadillac L is pretty sweet.
It has Super Cruise standard. So, if you
want that hands off the wheel driving
experience, you got that. And then NACS
via an adapter. I don't think they have
a native NACS port yet, but you can
charge a Tesla superchargers. And you
can get down into the 35ish range for a
used Cadillac L. So, I've also reviewed
the Optic and some other Cadillacs, but
L I can give a thumbs up to for sure.
And then rounding out my top three,
Genesis GV60. So, this one I'm putting
in the list because it it has the
basics, but it's also just it's
definitely more interesting than the
most popular vehicle on planet Earth.
Um, it has a lot of interesting features
like fingerprint reader. It has that the
little crystal interior elements and
obviously a very different looking
interior. It also has CarPlay and
Android Auto. That's going to be a theme
here for a lot of the alternatives to
Teslas which don't have that. But it
also is just a good performer. The maxed
out performance version of the GV60 is a
better performer than the Model Y
performance if you're interested in
that. But if you want a base one or if
you're just trying to get to a lower
price, you can get all the way down to
30 grand for a used GV60. So, with
features like summoning it out of a
parking spot with the remote and all
sorts of other weird stuff, like they
just did interesting things with the
GV60. And it turned out to be a really
good product and a good enough deal that
it rounds out my top three Model Y
alternatives. So, that's Model 3 and
Model Y. But, what if you're in the
market for a Model S? What if you're
looking at some of the slightly bigger,
slightly more spacious, and maybe more
premium uh luxurious feeling, but just
general larger sedans? Well, I've
already talked quite a bit about this
category. I daily drove a Model S for
many years. I said they were basically
the best daily driver you can get. But
then I found one that I feel like
oneuped the Model S in every useful way,
and that was the Lucid Air. And there's
a bunch of trims of Lucid Air. I think
the Lucid Air GT is probably the sweet
spot. 400 miles of range and also 800
horsepower. And I think they just do the
packaging so much better. They have a
lot of space on the interior. They have
a power opening frunk. They have more
frunk space. They have more rear foot
space. They have better headroom. And
just all the things about uh just being
in the car are great. It drives super
well. It also has CarPlay and Android
Auto. And I think they'll get down to
like I got to double check, but I think
somewhere in the 50s for a used Lucid
Air Grand Touring and that's a pretty
great deal. These things depreciate a
lot. Obviously, when they're new,
they're very, very expensive. But yeah,
Lucid Air, that's the obvious
alternative. But my second top
alternative here is going to be
something that does the sporty part a
little bit better. Um, and I did a main
channel video on this as well. It almost
took me away from a Model S. It's the
Porsche Tyan. Now, the Tyan 4S, the base
one, uh, even that base one is going to
have better interior materials than a
Tesla Model S. Uh, it's also it just
does the fun factor better. It drives
better. It feels sportier. It handles
incredibly well for an electric car. Uh,
even though they're still heavy. And
then there's other higherend trims as
well. But yeah, Tyan 4S you can get down
into the 40s for a used one. They
depreciate so much. uh the range is not
going to be as good, the comfort is not
going to be as the back room space is
not going to be as good. But if you want
an alternative that does the sporty side
of that fullsize EV better, go Tyan. And
then rounding out my top three, I would
say look at the BMW i5
M60 trim. So again, this is going to be
around 50 grand used
and it's a lot of the basics are the
same. Uh, it is a four-door full-size
sedan, but with, I think, a more
interesting interior and definitely a
very different look. It still is very
sporty and has a really torquy uh
response to the pedal, which is really
fun. So, it does the fun factor really
well and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay.
So, all those things that generally make
a good fundamental EV are still there.
Good range and all that. But if you just
want something a little more interesting
than all the Model S's you see around
the BMW i5.
The i7 is huge. You could still go i7.
The i3 is a little smaller. We'll get
there, but I think i5 is a nice sweet
spot. But then of course there is the
Tesla Model X, the big three row SUV
with the falcon wing doors. And uh well
there is obviously again maybe it's not
obvious, but there is one go-to. Again,
the same way that the Lucid Air was so
directly aimed at the Model S, my top
pick, and I reviewed this very recently,
the Lucid Gravity feels very much aimed
at the Model X. Now, it's not perfect.
All these have flaws. There's been a lot
of software bugs and weird stuff that
they're working out. And there is no
CarPlay support yet with the Lucid
Gravity, but in general, as far as a
rock solid like does all of the normal
fundamentals of an EV better, 350 plus
miles of range and 800 plus horsepower,
drives amazing, has great suspension,
great NVH, super quiet, ton of space on
the inside, a ton of storage, great
premium materials. like it's just aimed
at being the ultimate alternative to the
Model X. So, yeah, it succeeded. Now, a
very close second and third on my list
are vehicles I really like. Second, I
think you guys should check Rivian R1S.
I mean, that's a pretty clear one. Three
row SUV, but much more skewed towards
like the adventure capability side. So,
they have a ton of specs, a ton of SKs
for it. You can get a base one, you can
go all the way up to a quad motor. So,
if you want a plaid alternative, you can
go quad or you can go base. But the
three rows are are pretty similar in
terms of space. They have a little bit
more of like this action off-road
capable oriented. Like, you can go
off-road tires, you can go, you know, a
ton of air suspension travel, you can go
camping in this thing. That's the type
of thing that it's aimed for. And the
second generation version does all of
that phenomenally. It drives better than
the first gen. But if you want to use
first gen, you can go as cheap as like
60 grand. So, Rivan R1S is a is an
interesting character alternative. It
also doesn't have CarPlay or Android
Auto, so it's not like better in that
way, but Tesla people are used to that.
So, that's pretty good. But then you
should also definitely look at Volvo
EX90.
This one was a surprise to me. I hadn't
reviewed a bunch of Volvo stuff before
like the past year, and the EX90 is
their three row fully electric SUV. It
does have 300 plus miles of range, but
it does the premium feel so well. I
think my review I said it basically felt
like Rolls-Royce levels of premium
interior trim. It's so quiet on the
inside. The soft seats are really
comfortable. The speakers, oh my god,
the speakers in the EX90 are ridiculous.
Uh, now it does have that that little
LAR box at the top that's not activated
yet. And almost all of the alternatives
that I'm talking about so far and and
most of this video don't have as good of
self-driving features as a Tesla. So if
you're really into that, you're probably
not looking at any of these
alternatives. But as far as just pure
comfort, pure luxury, and pure feel, and
still nailing the fundamentals, it has
the full size three rows and a lot of
storage space and a little trunk, front
trunk. I think Volvo EX90 is pretty
sweet. You can get those used if you
really want used. I think there are some
now as low as like $7 something
thousand. And so then there is the
Cybert truck. The Cybert truck is a
full-size pickup truck. Okay. So
obviously it's a pretty polarizing
vehicle. Lots of people are looking at
alternatives for it because they do like
the idea of an electric pickup truck.
But uh actually I had a Cybert truck for
a while and I ended up selling it which
made headlines for some reason. But it's
because I had two electric trucks and I
actually like the other one better. That
other one is my top pick which is the
Rivian R1T. So the Rivian R1T is very
similar to the Cybertruck. It is
definitely smaller. So if you're
thinking about like a full-size truck,
this might not make your list. The back
seat is for sure smaller. It has a 4ft
bed, so utility is different, but again
very much in the adventure vehicle type
feel. So very capable off-roading. They
have a whole bunch of different specs
like I talked about before. You can go
base, you can go all the way up to quad,
which was an incredible performer. I
guess it's quicker than the Cybert truck
if you care about that. But it is
definitely a premiumba
and adventure oriented electric truck
that can really road trip and have 350
plus miles of range if you want it to.
Shout out to the Rivian R1T. It even has
an NACS port and just like a Tesla, no
CarPlay and no Android Auto. But the
second on my list I think is really more
onetoone as far as pure capabilities
because a lot of people considering a
cybert truck are at least thinking about
the different capabilities of the thing.
And the Chevy Silverado EV is a strong
competitor in the same exact segment of
a full-size pickup truck, but does a lot
of rock solid things. Like it has a
vastly superior range, 400 plus miles of
range. I think I was seeing like 450
when I was testing mine. So you should
watch that review. It also has things
like the midgate which allows you to get
extra storage. It has a six foot bed as
well and obviously all the things that
Silverados do so well. It has super
cruise as standard. It has I believe a
better towing capacity if you check
those numbers and you do tow with your
EV. You want the one with a huge
battery, more range and better towing
capacity. And uh I think you will need
an adapter to charge via NACS, but in
general a really well-built and
obviously also luxurious premium
electric truck. So, you can get into one
of those now for around 60 grand for a
good clean used one, which is I mean,
Cyber Trucks have also depreciated quite
a bit, so that might not be an advantage
for it, but the fact that it's available
for 400 plus miles of range, pretty
sweet. It's also huge. And then to round
out the top three, you've probably heard
this before, but like the original
competitor to the electric truck from
Tesla, it's the Ford F-150 Lightning.
It's just an F-150 but electric which
means it's going to do the fundamentals
of like being built well. It's going to
have it has a similar range. It's about
300 miles of range and also a similar
towing capacity but the shape, the
compatibility with accessories, all the
stuff people like to do with their
F-150s. Uh typically you can do the same
thing with the electric F-150. It has
blue cruise assisted driving and it does
have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay
available. and they've been around so
long that they've gotten down to like
the $ 35 to $40,000 price range for a
good used one. So yeah, F-150 Lightning
is like the safe bet. If you if the
Cybertruck's a little too risky for you,
a little too crazily designed, you want
to blend in more, then the F-150
Lightning is the opposite of that. So
yeah, that's that's my alternatives.
Model S, Model X, Model 3, Model Y,
Cybertruck. People buy them all for good
reasons. I have nothing against Tesla or
any hate for them. Obviously, their
products are really good and sell a ton
for uh a lot of good reasons. Uh but
yeah, this is my video answer to
literally the most frequently asked
question I get from a lot of people who
are shopping for this stuff. And there's
a lot of good reviews on this channel of
other EVs that I didn't even mention in
this video. So, check those out as well.
But there you have it. Thanks for
watching. Catch you in the next one.

So, in the world of electric cars, there
are groundup EVs, and then there's
recycling the old design, but making it
electric. And I usually prefer the
groundup EV. It's more efficient. You
get more space. It just feels like a
more well-considered product. But
sometimes, sometimes you got to keep the
old design. And this is one of those
examples. This is definitely the old
design, but electric mostly. So, this is
the electric G Wagon, or more
specifically, one of the G Wagons, the
one that happens to be electric. This is
the G580 with EQ technology, and it's
positioned basically as the middle tier
option. It's right above the inline
six-powered G550 and the V8 powered AMG
G63. So, it's not replacing the gas
models. It's just one of the G Wagons
has an electric powertrain. And to me,
it makes a lot of sense. So, you want to
preserve this iconic G Wagon thing, but
kind of prepare it for the future a
little bit. Now, the specs of this one,
h, they're not great. Okay, they're not
great. It is a quad motor vehicle with
all-wheel drive, and it makes about 579
horsepower and 859 lb-ft of torque, but
it also weighs almost 7,000 lb. So, it
deserves 60 and 4.1 seconds. And it has
a 116 kWh battery pack. But because it's
still shaped like a G Wagon, which
people like, it does not have great
aerodynamics. That's about as
aerodynamic as a tombstone. So, you're
going to get like 240 mi of range if
you're chilling. Uh, and of course, it's
worse in the winter. So, it's not the
most efficient. It's not the best
numbers, but if you want the G Wagon
experience, but electric, that's what
this is delivering. So, aesthetically on
the outside, you know, this looks very
familiar. It does do a couple special
things like this grill at the front
doesn't have to be as massive of a
radiator. You can still see a radiator
in there, but this uh lights up as an
LED at night, which is cool. But then
you get around the side and there's no
mistaking this for anything else. It's
clearly a G Wagon. Super boxy. You've
got that flat front, the lights at the
corners, this line right through the
middle of the entire vehicle, 20-in
wheels that it's sitting on, and the
charge port, the electric one's back
right corner, which I thought was
interesting. It's not the most common
place to put your charge port, but it is
CCS. It will do, I think, 200 kW, so
it's it's not super slow, but yeah, back
right for your charge port. And then you
get to the back of the vehicle and
there's that obviously iconic spare spot
and the lights and the slots and all
this room in the back behind the rear
seats, which is it's really nice.
There's no sub trunk or anything, but
that's plenty of space by my standards.
And of course, a little luxury touches
everywhere with the the crosshatched
leather. And uh I want to make sure the
mic picks this up. So this is what it
sounds like to close the door.
That's nice. This is what it sounds like
to lock the door.
That's so nice. I really hope the mic
picks that up because that is a pretty
pretty classic G Wagon experience. Just
the sound of opening and closing the
doors. And this all continues once you
get inside this thing. Once you pass the
MercedesBenz branded corner lights and
the EQ badge to know it's the electric
one and even the the letter G on the
handles. That's when you pop in and get
into the G Wagon's driver's seat and you
understand why people spend so much for
these things because it's a it's a
Mercedes and the luxuries is everywhere.
It does have a push button start. I
don't love that in every AV, but I guess
they keep that just to keep people
familiar. And yeah, there's a lot going
on here. I'm actually glad they didn't
go all screens or do something crazy
like I just saw with the new Porsche
Cayenne going electric. They they very
much kept this in line with the rest of
the G Wagon lineup. Meaning you still
have Mercedes software with all of their
Windows 7 looking, you know, holographic
lightsaber tachometer and all that, but
it's surrounded by more physical luxury.
Nice materials, a nice grab handle, the
vents with little LED lights in them
like all the Mercedes stuff you're used
to seeing. And then of course some real
vents down here or real buttons down
here.
nice hazard sound. Uh, and also for
changing temperature and fan speed, but
a single wireless charger as well. You
get two USB type-C ports. There is
wireless Android Auto and CarPlay.
There's the two cup holders, the swipe
pad, which is always here, and then the
dynamic button to switch between your
drive modes. And then a little bit of
storage in the middle. But I think maybe
the part of the interior that symbolizes
the GWAC luxury the most is the seats.
these huge hefty seats which are
obviously leather and stitched really
nicely but are heated are ventilated.
They'll massage you and they actually
have these adjustable like the headrest
here will like cradle your head in place
if you want it to. And these bolsters by
default uh move quite a bit. They're
active. So, if I turn, they kind of hug
me to keep me in the middle of the seat.
And they move quite a bit. And I think
they respond to geforce, if I'm
understanding them correctly, because
they can get accidentally triggered by
going through a pothole. But they do hug
you. If I turn right and I move to the
left in the seat, it'll hug me to keep
me in the middle. So, these seats, these
seats are crazy and they are very
comfortable and very large. But yeah, my
only other notes from daily driving it,
uh, some of these might be nitpicks, but
I'm going to say them anyway. One,
visibility is great. Uh, all the windows
are flat, including the windshield, and
I can just look right in my blind spot
here. So, that's awesome. Um, but also
because this uh this stuff is up here,
like on the window sill, and this actual
moving piece here for the lock is in the
window, when I want to rest my arm on
the window, uh, it's constantly jamming
up against that. So, I don't really rest
my arm here as much in this car as I
normally would. Uh, but cabin isolation
thanks to these windows is awesome. So,
it gets really quiet in here, which
brings me to the speakers, which are not
as good as I thought they would be.
There are a lot of speakers in this
cabin. If you look around, you'll see
quite a few of them from in the doors to
in the roof. Uh, by the way, this shade
closes, which is nice. But there are
there are speakers everywhere and they
get very loud, but they don't sound as
good as I anticipated. Maybe that's just
this review unit or this sound system,
but it is says Burmeister, so I was
expecting a little more. Now, just so
you can hear what it sounds like to turn
it on with the push button start,
whole bunch of beeps.
Not the same not the same theater as the
V8, but obviously it does have maybe
it's not so obvious, but it does have a
little bit of fake sound. And when you
hit throttle and you drive a little bit,
there's also a bit of a fake sound, bit
of a rumble. But let's go to the back
seat because if you're bringing people
around, you'll also want them to have a
decent amount of room. And that's
exactly how I would describe it. It's a
decent amount of room. So this is my 63
driving position here. And this might be
a crazy cross reference, but it reminds
me of my Rivian R1T. It's got cutouts in
the back of the seats, so there's like
just enough room to have, you know, no
complaints for your your rear seat
passengers. They'll have plenty of
controls over HVAC, USB type-C down
there, many more speakers, and these are
heated seats. Uh, and of course, tons of
leather. Oh, sounds so good to close the
door. Um, but yeah, I I really do feel
like it's about the front seat. It's
about the experience living with it,
breathing the air inside, smelling like
leather all the time, feeling the luxury
of owning a G Wagon. But of course, you
got to drive the thing. So, Miles is
going to tell us what it's like to
drive, but I will just say before we
pass it off to Miles, I was pretty
impressed. Obviously, this thing is high
off the ground, but the battery pack is
down in the bottom, so most of the
weight now is pretty low. It rides
really well. It's smooth, and it feels
right in line with the luxury of what a
Jeep like this that costs almost 200
grand should feel like. But is it better
than the gas versions? Take it away,
Miles. So, I thought I'd take advantage
of the new dual capture feature on the
iPhone 17 Pro to show you the most
important feature on this vehicle.
You're welcome. Okay, I might be getting
my enthusiast card taken away today, but
I have to confess. I have to confess.
This is my favorite version of the G
Wagon to drive. Does it sound better
than the AMG G63? No, because it doesn't
have a big burblin burbo V8. And is it
necessarily more efficient than the V8
version that it doesn't technically
replace? No, not really. Because this is
literally a brick on wheels. So, it's
never going to be efficient no matter
what powertrain you stuff in here. But
the fact of the matter is the weight
distribution and the center of gravity
is much more improved here because like
Marquez said, the batteries are on the
floor of the chassis. So, all that
weight is closer to the ground, which
makes it sharper and notably more
dynamic to drive than the gas powered
versions of the G Wagon. I'm feeling
very much less like afraid of rolling
this thing despite it weighing nearly
what, 7,000 lb. Yeah, it's it's nuts.
But yeah, I never thought I'd say this,
but I think this is the more dynamic
version of the G Wagon because of
electrification. Now, the G580 has a
whopping two less horsepower than the
G63, but where the car really feels like
a lot more powerful and a lot more
usable is with the torque figure with a
total of 859
lb feet of torque. And you may think
that because this car weighs 1,000 lb
more than the G63 that it kind of evens
out and all that extra torque doesn't
make a difference. But you would be
wrong. You see all that torque is
distributed between not one, not two,
not three, but four electric motors
controlling each wheel of the car. And
having high horsepower, that's really
only effective for top- end, very
high-speed driving. Torque is a lot more
important for driving a car like this,
especially if you're going to off-road,
which is kind of what this car is for,
but no one really does. when going from
40 to 60 mph on the freeway. This is
what the turbochargers in the G63 look
like. And this is what it looks like
when going from 40 to 60 on the freeway
with the G580. You see the difference?
It's just so much more smooth and
seamless. And the throttle response is
obviously instantaneous because it's
electric. And so despite this car not
having more horsepower than the G63, the
power you do have in terms of the mass
amounts of low-end torque through the
electric motors, it feels a lot more
powerful in your everyday life. If that
if that makes any sense. This feels a
lot more powerful in ways that actually
matter to a regular person. And because
of the quad motor setup, you've got a
really cool torque vectoring system
that's going to come in handy for all
that off-roading that all G Wagon owners
are doing all the time. Me personally,
I'm on my like fifth tank turn of the
day. Hey, I just do so much off-roading
I have to do it all the time. You know,
if you only want an internal combustion
engine vehicle, then this version is not
going to do much for you. But the fact
of the matter is this is the most
capable version of the G Wagon that
they've made so far because of the quad
motor setup. You've got really cool
torque vectoring, which is awesome for
off-roading situations, and it's going
to be the best longish distance cruiser
to do driving in. Because it's electric,
the ride is a lot more refined and
smooth, and the cabin is very quiet and
peaceful and insulated. And you know
what else? This is going to end up being
the most affordable version of the G
Wagon to buy as well, thanks to
depreciation, because no one's really
buying the G580, which is uh that's
unfortunate for Mercedes-Benz, but great
for secondhand owners. So, okay, at the
end of the day, a lot of good things to
say about this vehicle. And my real
question is, well, if you were handed
200 grand, would you pick this over all
the other things you could get for it?
Obviously,
the unique G Wagon experience. You can
hear that rumble, right? Totally fake.
Uh, it's it's a fun experience that I
think a lot of people who end up
spending this kind of money are after.
But would you pick this over the gas
version? Let me know. Thanks for
watching. Catch you in the next one."

couple times on this channel, and most
recently with the Lucid Air Sapphire,
which I called uh the best performance
SUV ever made. I really like Lucids. I
think they're great products, but
they've never been the most popular ones
in the world. They've been sedans.
They've been pretty expensive. And so,
this is Lucid's first entry into a new
vehicle category that may just be enough
to save them. Although, I don't really
think I need to use those phrases, but
it might turn over a new leaf for them
because this is an SUV. SUVs are very
popular here in the US. And so this is
called the Lucid Gravity. Just like the
intro to this video, it's different. I
mean, it's kind of the same, but it's
definitely different. Obviously, if
you've seen the Air before, you've seen
the silhouette. You can recognize
obviously already some of the pieces
like this front little visor here. And
you might have already actually watched
my initial impressions video of the
Lucid Gravity from a couple months back
when it was stationary in a showroom.
But now I've gotten to drive it for a
little bit. And well, spoiler alert, a
lot of the things that you expect out of
a Lucid are still here, which is good
news. They're really good at a lot of
stuff like the engineering and the
efficiency and the packaging. And then
there's some stuff that's a little bit
surprising, too, and you'll pretty
quickly get to that. So, let me just
start with the outside cuz I think I
think this is a little bit more minivan
looking than I remember. So, let me know
what you think about the looks. So, here
goes your side profile. You know, this
is the all black Lucid Air Grand
Touring. You can see a little bit of the
Sporty Arrow feature back here, but I
think there's some minivan inspiration
or DNA. Not a bad thing. This is a three
row, very functional vehicle, and
minivans are very functional, so I'm not
complaining. It's got that stealth
blackout package, and it does have a
couple optional extras that bring it up
to our $122,000
as spec, including uh this Tahoe
interior. It's got larger 21in and 22in
wheels. It's got rear wheel steering.
It's got a couple other things that
Miles will talk about in the driving
section. But in general, yeah, it's
all-wheel drive, dual motor, 900vt
architecture, and rated for up to 450 mi
of range. So, right off the bat, let me
just talk about the range for a second
because when I read on paper that the
Lucid Gravity Grand Touring, this is the
first spec available of this thing, is
going to have 450 mi of range on like a
100ish kilowatt hour battery and have
828 horsepower.
That's that feels impossible for one
vehicle to have both things, crazy
efficiency and ridiculous power. So, the
expectations are skyhigh. Then I got to
test it and drive it and I never
actually got anywhere near 450 miles of
range. I started daily driving this
thing and you know there are some
options that make it heavier. For
example, the 450 mi range version would
be the two row 5-seater. It would have
the smallest 20 and 21in wheels. This
has bigger wheels. This has a little bit
more weight inside. But I never even saw
400 miles of range. I saw I think the
highest I ever got was at 100% pulling
out the driveway 386 miles of range
which is still really good but you know
obviously that brings it a little bit
down to earth. Expectations are the
thief of joy. I shouldn't be all mad
that this doesn't get 450 but this is a
very aerodynamic vehicle still. You see
the visor, you see the active arrow
features, the flaps that open and close
based on when you need ventilation. Also
on these wheels, they are bigger and
hurt your range, but you can pop off
these arrow covers and get a little bit
less range if you want to. Uh, but this
is the best case scenario for these
bigger wheels getting almost 400 miles
of range. This is the first and only
vehicle in Luca's lineup with the NACS
port, so you can charge in with no
adapter in the US at Tesla
Superchargers, which is pretty sick. The
Lucid Airs still don't have NACS ports.
I thought maybe the Sapphire would have
it by now or maybe they just refresh the
entire lineup. That's a decision they're
going to have to make at some point. But
yeah, for now, just the Gravity has
NACS. And you know, if you take price
out of the equation, maybe, just maybe,
this is the closest thing we have to the
Leato Mega for the US. Like, if there
was a Leo Mega in the US, it would be an
electric SUV with all the bleeding edge
tech and awesome efficiency and NACS
like kind of like this, right? Okay, let
me look at this front trunk now. So,
this is the key fob to the Lucid
Gravity. It's also attached here to a
key card that I've been using more
because I have had some issues with the
key fob. Not the first time that's
happened to me in a Lucid, but to open
the front trunk, you obviously have that
front trunk button right here. Hold it.
Really loud external speakers. And then
the front trunk pops open. It's decently
sized. You can definitely do groceries
here. You can also definitely sit here
if you want to, but that is hyper
functional. And obviously they have
these huge clamshell openings on the
front and the back. So lovely to see
that. And then yeah, might as well while
we're here, go ahead round the back,
hold down the trunk opening button,
and this is your classic Lucid massive
clamshell opening to a huge, huge,
huge amount of rear space. That's my
bad. Sometimes our little plate covers
fall off cuz they're just taped on. Let
me know if you have a suggestion for a
better one. Anyway, okay. This is an
example of the incredible practicality
and space and packaging that Lucid is
capable of. They've already done an
awesome job with the Air. This is the
back of the Gravity. This is the third
row. That is the second row. And that's
the first row way up there. Already a
ton of space, but you can see I have it
set up like this cuz I wanted to just
show you something. You can fold the
back seat, the third row completely flat
into this back cubby space here. So, you
can have two back seats or you can fold
both of them back in here. If you have
the two back seats up, obviously that's
a ton of storage. And then you have
these buttons to fold down the second
row. So, I'll just go ahead and fold
down the right side, second row here.
I'll press that. It kind of moves the
front seat forward and then drops that
row also completely flat. So, you can go
totally flat with all of these seats and
fit a ridiculous amount of stuff back
here. done a lot of really clever work
with the battery being all the way in
the floor and all of the spacing of the
seats and everything. And I think what
you've ended up with, which is a crazy
stat, is the same amount of interior
storage space as the Cadillac Escalade
IQ, but 3 ft shorter, which is pretty
sick. And once you get inside, Lucid's
theme of really good packaging and
high-tech definitely continues. You can
uh close the front trunk. powered from
that button, that huge clam shell front
trunk. And you can see there's a 12 and
a half inch touchscreen over here and
also a huge amount of screen behind the
steering wheel. And so they've done this
little this little squirle thing here,
which is a little bit flatter on top so
you can see the screen better. Um, it's
a little lower than you might expect it
to be and it's a little bit smaller than
you might expect it to be, but it's
actually really comfortable and I find
it pretty nice. The visibility is also
massive because this huge amount of
glass goes way up above your head. Kind
of like a Tesla Model X. Probably is
really expensive to replace if you get a
chip in it. But that is a lot of light
coming in. And then this interior is as
nice as I remember it. Lucid does a
really good job in the airs and this is
definitely no exception. This is the
Tahoe brown leather interior with these
heated massaging wellbolstered seats.
Uh, a lot of the touch points, a lot of
the areas that you're resting on are
nice soft leather. There's also the the
door handle. I had a couple weird
problems where it took two tries to open
the door handle from the driver's side
only. Might just be a bit of a bug, but
uh these glass windows are I'll show you
insulated, double insulated. It's super
quiet in the cabin. This also has the
upgraded speakers. So, there's 22
speakers in this cabin. I don't even
really see most of them. You can see
like a little bit of the speaker stuff
up here and up here, but 22 speakers in
here. I would say the speakers sound
pretty good. They're Dolby Atmos
capable. They're not amazing. Not like S
tier like some of the highest end
vehicles I've ever tried, but definitely
really really nice, especially when the
cabin's so quiet. Uh, riding along, and
we'll talk about driving in a second,
but riding along super super smooth. And
then plenty of storage here. So, this
can obviously open and close. You have
this interior storage down here which
goes underneath. And then when you open
this, you can also move this back and
fit even more stuff under here. This is
the spot where the key card rests, but
it's also a 15 watt wireless charger for
your phone. Not quite Leo Mega status,
but you know, good to have a wireless
charger. And then here, oh yeah, here's
a sponsor to this video, the Insta360
X5. You know, the Lucid Gravity does
have surround view cameras built in for
parking, which is convenient, obviously,
but a 360 camera like this represents a
really good way for content creators who
are making car videos to be able to
unlock way more shots using a 360
camera. 360 cameras, if we're being
honest, haven't had the best rap for
quality specifically in the past, but
this is a generation that gets us to up
to 8K 360 video. So, you do have a lot
of room and a lot of pixels to move
around and crop in and get your shots
that actually still look crisp and good.
And this even has larger sensors, unlike
the Pixel I'm shooting on uh than the
last generation. So, the last one, the
X3 and X4, I think, had 1/2 in sensors.
This is a one over 1.28 in sensor. So,
it's letting in 144% more light and has
killer low light performance, too. And
then, of course, it makes it easy to
edit 360 video with its AI editing
because the AI just keeps whatever is
the subject in the frame as it's moving
around the 360 sphere that this is
recording in. So you don't have to do a
whole bunch of manual refframing.
There's a ton of other features in this
thing, too. From the better
stabilization to the improved, you know,
wind noise filtering and single and
triple suction mounts let you get some
crazy angles and crazy shots with a
camera like this. So, the first 50
people to order through the link down
below uh will get a free selfie stick
and car suction cup mount to go shoot
some car videos. So, be sure to check
that out if you're interested. And
thanks to Insta3 for sponsoring this
video. So, I'm going to hand it to Miles
in a minute for some more in-depth
thoughts specifically on driving
dynamics on a car like this with 800
plus horsepower and rear wheel steering
and all sorts of other interesting
features. Uh, but the two things that
struck me most while daily driving and
living with the Lucid Gravity that kind
of aren't really a surprise, but I was
still glad to see it are, like I said,
the packaging and storage space again.
And this software was actually really
good and intuitive. You have kind of
like two separate software environments
going on with the 12 and a half inch
screen here and then the touchcreen
environment up here. Lucid people will
already sort of be used to what's
happening here which is oh I said I said
the magic L word so now it's listening
to me. I was going to try to figure out
what I want to say but I'm not giving it
a command so maybe cancel stop doing
that like this all the way over here.
This is familiar to lucid people. You
kind of have this habit now of like
grabbing the lefth hand side and you
always know you can unlock over here or
defrost or do headlights or or open the
tailgate. That's always over there. And
then this left side is also a touchcreen
to get through a couple other little
bits of information or just go zen and
just have nothing over there. But I
usually have my local range and that
typically updates pretty quickly once
every couple seconds. And then over here
is a touchcreen which is always just
your normal car stuff. And then
underneath it, this 12 and a half inch
screen is totally separate. So whatever
I do up here, it never affects what goes
down down here. It's kind of the
opposite of what was happening with the
last lucids where you could drag stuff
between them. So let's say I have maps
open up here, which I think that's a
pretty normal thing to have up here.
That will never get interrupted no
matter what you do down here. So if you
want to do HVAC controls or if you want
to do your phone settings or your media
or even another instance of maps if you
really wanted to. I think I can do that.
Yeah, it will never interrupt what
happens up here because they're
separate. Uh, so I like that a lot. I
also love that this volume button is
always really easily accessible and your
HVAC controls are always just a few taps
away because these are physical buttons.
So, that's awesome. And then there's
like this programmable button which just
does the glove box for now, which I
think is good because having to go to
the touchcreen for the glove box is
insane. Uh, real HVAC vents, which is
great. Here's one slight complaint you
might have, though. No Apple CarPlay, at
least for now, out the box. It's
supposed to be coming with an OTAA
update, but as of right now, the car I'm
driving does not have CarPlay, which is
kind of a bummer. So, I'm just pairing
my phone and doing media with my uh
Bluetooth connection. Uh but yeah, all
of these settings are super easy uh to
navigate through. Sprint mode is the
fastest mode with the lowest ride
height. Swift is somewhere in the
middle. And then smooth, you can have
like a medium or even higher average
suspension uh with normal, high, or off
regen. Uh, love that. Anytime you swipe
down from the bottom, these are always
the quick controls. So, if you want to
do pet mode, if you want to do battery
preconditioning or just change the
volume or jeez, brightness, then you can
always do that or go glove box. But then
these are all the normal things you
might do in a car. You might want to
turn on your massaging seats. This is
the first massaging seat I've had
actually have a butt massage as well. I
don't know if you're into that, but
usually massaging seats just do the
back. This one also does the butt. Cool.
Uh, you have your HVAC controls. You
have your energy graph so you can see if
you're using more or less energy than
expected, your music, your media again,
and then you even have this like zen
mode thing so you can sit back and the
screens get taken over and it plays this
nature sounds. I personally didn't use
that, but it's a cool thought. And then
of course your 360 parking cameras. So
software is really easy to go through.
It's stable. It's quick. There's no
CarPlay for now, which is a bummer, but
hopefully that comes very soon. You
know, as cool as they are, I ended up
not really using these touch sensitive
areas on the steering wheel that much.
They built these in so that you can
without ever taking your hand off the
squirle uh move around and control the
stuff on the main touchcreen back here.
And that's pretty cool. It even has
haptic feedback and it has dedicated
voice control buttons and it has another
customizable button here. But I ended up
just doing a lot of reaching like I did
in old Lucids, which is, you know, maybe
just habit and maybe if I use it even
longer, I'd get lazy and then start
touching the steering wheel for that
control a little bit more. But I did
notice that, you know, this is a really
cool high-tech thing that I really
appreciated in my first hands-on and
then ended up not using very much. Just
food for thought. But let me show you
the second row because you get a vehicle
like this, of course, not just to sit in
the front seat, but to have people sit
in the second set of seats, too. And
well, first thing you'll notice is there
is a ton of leg room, which is awesome.
Foot room and headroom, glass roof. You
also have the screens, which people seem
to really like. There's way more
speakers in the back row all over the
place. And there's also vents in really
nice spots. But maybe the most
interesting thing as I go to ultra wide
here is this uh
laptop tray in the second row of the
gravity so you can get your work done if
you're being chauffeurred around in one
of these things. There's also that
second row HVAC controls as well. Now
I'm going to attempt to go to the third
row through the side here. It's probably
going to be extremely awkward and not
very graceful, but I'm going to do it
anyway because we need to see what the
leg room is like behind
the second row for third row passengers.
And uh you know what? It's not bad. I
haven't actually sat back here yet, so
I'm just sort of evaluating it in real
time. This is slightly slightly better
than the Rivian R1S. This is worse than
the Cadillac Escalade IQ as far as third
row legroom, but it's not a bad space to
be. There's vents again back here.
There's still a ton of sunroof, and
there's a little bit of storage. USB
type-C. That's nice. And there it is. I
mean, I'm up against it. So, if I had
another seat next to me, they'd also be
up against it. But that's Yeah, that's
that's pretty good. That's decent third
row. So, in a vehicle that's not really
much bigger than a typical, you know,
van, this is a this is a good throw
third row space to be.
Head room is maybe the only tiny
weakness. So, without any further ado,
let me throw it to Miles to talk a
little bit more about what it's like
driving one of the most advanced driving
through electric SUVs ever made.
Chrysler never had the guts to build a
Pacifica Hellcat, and uh Toyota's
probably never going to make a GR
Sienna. and the legendary R63 AMG. Well,
that minivan is gone. But Lucid, Lucid
have answered the call. And uh this
thing is amazing to drive. Let me
firstly preface this review by saying
this is effectively the middle tier trim
of Lucid Gravity. There's a dream
edition of the GT that has 200 extra
horsepower on top of this and can run a
106
in the 1/4 mile. And hopefully there
will eventually be a sapphire version of
this car. But man, let me tell you, this
this is plenty enough for me. It is
incredibly difficult to make a
sevenseater SUV/ minivan style car drive
in a way that massages the enthusiast
lobe on my brain, but somehow Lucid have
done it. Not that I should be surprised
at this point. The first way in which
it's doing that is by how low it is to
the ground. as you've seen from the
outside of the car, but that applies to
the inside of the car as well. You can
set the seat to go super low, the
steering wheel too, to have a very
driver focused uh driving position. And
then when you take this thing into
corners and bends, the body roll, at
least for a nearly 7,000 lb SUV with me
inside of it, is really minimal. You
couldn't tell this car weighs nearly
7,000 lb by the way it just goes down a
back road like an absolute scalpel.
Gravity does 0 to 60 in about 3 and 1/2
seconds, which isn't phenomenal for an
EV. Obviously, we've tested cars that
can go quicker than that, but you can
tell there's definitely some software
limitation on the launch control. I
definitely think they're sandbagging it
a bit via software, and I think that
might just be because they're trying to
save room for a more performanceoriented
version of the car. But either way,
you're still blowing the doors off of
pretty much every other sevenseater that
isn't electrified. Now, this Squirkle
style steering wheel isn't my favorite
kind of steering wheel. I definitely
prefer the setup they have in the air,
but I can understand why Lucid went with
this style of wheel for gravity. And it
certainly isn't hard to get used to as
far as maneuvering gravity. And because
the steering is so sharp and responsive
and almost steer by wirelike, you don't
really have to do a whole lot of
movement like you would with a
traditional wheel. But when you're not
sending it down a back road, which isn't
really something a lot of Gravity owners
will do anyway. The suspension is very
refined. It's supple and compliant. It
handles uneven pavement and potholes
pretty well given the size and weight of
the car. And given how low it sits to
the ground, even the lowest ride height,
it's still extremely compliant with
crappy New Jersey roads, which I
experience a lot of around here. And
then the cabin itself is just so serene
and peaceful and insulated compared to
an R1S. It just feels a lot more refined
and luxury oriented, but at the same
time a lot more sporty and enthusiast
focused. It's really interesting. When I
think of some of my favorite
sevenseaters I've ever driven, I think
of like the Escalade V, the Alpena XB7,
heck, even the Volvo EX90. That's a
great one. The Gravity doesn't have the
epic supercharged V8 gunshot burbles of
the Escalade V or the luscious lavalina
leather of the Alpena XB7, but I think
as an overall package, you could argue
that this is the better car just because
it kind of does everything really well
and just has that enthusiast uh and
dynamic edge that somehow the Escalade
and Alpena don't, even though those are
internal combustion engine powered cars.
This is easily my favorite seven-seater
electric car that I've ever driven. When
I'm driving this, I don't even think
about the Model X or the R1S at all,
just because this feels like so much
more of a complete package. So, now all
we do is wait for the Sapphire version.
That car is going to melt my brain. All
right, so let me just wrap this video up
with a question that I don't really
think we're going to know the answer to
anytime soon, but I think it's
interesting to think about, which is
something you might see in stockholder
uh subreddits or just people wondering
about this company, which is can this
vehicle save Lucid? Can the Gravity save
the uh not very financially optimized
company that is Lucid? And uh look,
they're they're not making a ton of
profit on every vehicle. So, I don't
think they're making any profit on these
vehicles yet, but I do think because of
how good this is and because of how
popular this segment is, especially in
the US, this I think does have the
potential to become their most popular
vehicle, their bestselling vehicle. I
think if they have a a Lucid Air or
sorry, Gravity Touring that's cheaper,
that maybe starts in the 80s or 90s,
that can be even more likely to be their
bestselling vehicle. Um, I don't think
it's going to miraculously turn the
whole company around on paper, but I
kind of just I just like the vehicles
anyway. Like the Lucid Air Sapphire is
in the same category for me is like,
okay, it's not going to make their
company profitable, but I'm glad it
exists. I'm glad someone put that type
of engineering work in to make such an
incredible thing. And I kind of feel the
same way about this. Only time will
tell, though. Let me know what you think
down below. Thanks for watching. Catch
you in the next one. Peace."

put it in a smaller, lighter, mid-enine
chassis with a lot of the same aero

And the most race car thing ever. This
intake system is right behind your head

[Music]
It's starting to sound actually kind of
like this car might be better than the 3
RS. One more thing, this car, just like
the 911, does have a front trunk, but
since they move that engine forward to
make it mid engine instead of rear
engine, you also get a trunk trunk. So,
if the 3 RS is the best sports car out,

HcvF3XFlHeM,CarPlay Ultra Review - The Closest thing to an Apple Car!,"If you've got a newer iPhone and an Aston Martin, you're in luck.

I don't I don't think
we're supposed to be able to see this.
Uh but I I just found the Apple car in
the wild. This is the first time
anybody's ever gotten a look at it. And
it looks a lot like a plasma blue Aston
Martin DBX77.
There it is. Or actually, wait a second.
That is a Plasma Blue DBX 707. I'm
joking. Obviously, this is not the Apple
car. This is a DBX. But that's the
thing. Apple announced CarPlay Ultra
years ago at like WWDC and then we
didn't really hear anything and didn't
see any cars supporting it. And then
years later they updated us again and
there still were no cars supporting it.
And then this year at Dubdub there was
one. This was the one in the keynote.
This is when they were driving around at
like the top of Apple Park or driving
around their campus or whatever to
demonstrate what CarPlay Ultra is. Aston
Martin is officially on board and this
is my first look in actually testing and
using CarPlay Ultra as someone who's
only used like most of us regular
CarPlay. It's interesting. There's some
stuff that's better. There's some stuff
that's clever about it and maybe some
stuff that you might not like. So, uh,
let's get in the car. I'm not actually
reviewing the Aston Martin. I'm
reviewing
CarPlay Ultra today. Maybe leave a
thumbs up below this video if you'd like
to see me get this car back to just
review the DBX. But for now, we're
talking software. And the DBX has two
screens to show software on. So, we got
to talk about both of them. So, here's
basically how to think about this. The
difference between CarPlay, as you
already know it, and CarPlay Ultra.
CarPlay is essentially just a second
screen mirrored for your iPhone. It
looks like this. You've seen that
before. CarPlay Ultra is a collaboration
between your car and CarPlay to also
bring in vehicle controls and all the
other stuff from your car. So, you know
how if you're in CarPlay and you have to
go change something specific like some
speaker settings or your air conditioner
settings or something like that, you
have to leave CarPlay, go do the vehicle
settings, and then go back into CarPlay,
right? The point of CarPlay Ultra is it
takes over all of the screens in your
car to give you access to all of those
things without ever having to leave
CarPlay.
Now, that does require some work and
there's some pretty clever things that
they've done to make sure you almost
never ever have to actually leave
CarPlay, but let me show you what I what
I actually mean by that. So, here's a
center screen. It looks the way it
normally does. You've got all the apps.
This is my iPhone. So, these are the
apps that are on my iPhone. But then
you'll notice there's a couple extra
things like the climate control,
temperature, and vehicle settings and
radio and climate controls. And that's
because if you go into these, you can
actually continue to adjust settings
from the actual car, which you couldn't
do in just normal CarPlay, which is
mirroring your phone. And your phone
doesn't know these things about your
car. So, you can change the temperature
and change the fan speed and the way it
syncs or doesn't sync. You can change
radio. Go into the radio. listen to FM
radio if you want just by staying in
CarPlay. And of course, vehicle
settings. So, there are things about the
way you drive, different drive modes,
how the exhaust sounds in GT mode versus
sport mode versus sport plus. All this
stuff is now inside CarPlay Ultra. But
there's something really clever. This is
all like nicely configured because Aston
Martin and Apple have worked together to
build this nice thing. But there are
still a couple extra things that aren't
built into CarPlay. And that's when they
do this thing called punch through UI.
It's exactly what it sounds like. If I
want to adjust the specific Bowers and
Wilkins speaker settings inside the DBX,
inside CarPlay, they haven't built the
whole UI for that. So when I click into
there, it literally just opens up a
frame and punches through and shows the
regular vehicle settings. So this is
what you'd have if you didn't have
CarPlay. And now I can change things
like where the surround sound is
focused, all seats or just the driver,
stuff like that. And then when I exit
out, it goes back to CarPlay. So if
there are things that are not built
specifically in this UI with Apple, like
here's another version. If I go to
reverse in this car, it's got to show me
my reversing cameras. Well, that's also
just a punch through of the feed to the
reverse camera. And when I go back to
drive, well, I'll X out and it goes back
to CarPlay. So, punch through UI is this
clever way of making sure you can do
everything in CarPlay. And if it's
something super specific that they
haven't built the UI for, you can still
do it. Now, there's also this screen up
here. Wow, I
forgot that I was in drive. So, this is
a screen that Apple CarPlay typically
doesn't exist, which is the one right
behind the steering wheel, but since
it's a display, might as well. So, Aston
Martin has built these really nice
looking UIs that I can actually quickly
flip through that are designed to look
like Aston Martin software, but that
also have your, you know, legibility and
your fonts and your hints of Apple. And
you can actually swipe up and down to
change what shows in the center. So,
there's a bunch of different views, and
I think some of these look kind of cool.
This one actually looks kind of like an
EV would. Like if I wanted to see my
revs, I wouldn't, you know, I wouldn't
pick this little line view. I'd probably
go to a view with more of like a normal
tachometer. There you go. That looks a
little more Aston Martin to me. But
then, yeah, you can always change the
center. And these are really easy and
quick to switch through. So your ADAS,
your maps, all sorts of stuff like your
music playing, if you have Spotify or
Apple Maps, whatever it is, your PSI,
it's getting all that information from
the car and showing it in CarPlay. And
this all works together. It's cool that
it works together because if I move over
to say this view with a little orange
down at the bottom, that actually syncs
up with a little orange down at the
bottom here with this wallpaper. So,
they're all working together to show you
information from your car. Now, there's
one last thing that's a little
interesting, which is see down here this
uh this odometer and these little these
little tiny icons down here that are
actually not quite carplay. These are
still rendered by the car. I think
legally they have to render certain
things locally on the car. So if your
phone ever disconnects or dies, you
still should always know these things.
Um, and these are actually not quite
punch through. These are overlays. So
your odometer reading right here has got
this little cutout for legibility and
that will always be readable and always
rendered by the car. Same thing with say
uh your airbag warning or seat belt
warning or low tire pressure or any
certain things that are uh overlays from
the car. But otherwise, that's all
CarPlay. That's all CarPlay. It's all
coming from the iPhone and collaborating
with the car. Interestingly, CarPlay
Ultra is wireless only. So, there's no
wired CarPlay Ultra. Uh and it will work
from an iPhone 12 or later and anything
on iOS 18.5 or later. So those are the
only requirements to getting this to
work other than of course owning an
Aston Martin and DBX. Uh and so that's
the experience basically. You get a lot
more used to messing with vehicle
controls, climate controls without ever
leaving CarPlay. And that's the main
advantage and having this fun little UI
that you can quickly switch between and
maybe say you want to do big maps
because you're in a new area you don't
travel in too often and you can still
see things about your car like how much
range you have left and your speed or
then maybe you want to flip back to the
classic tachometers that feel more Aston
Martin to me. The fun thing about this
that I actually think is really
interesting is it's gonna be different
in different cars. Like clearly this is
a very bespoke experience for this one,
right? But there's also a ton of buttons
in the Aston Martin. And so if I want to
change temperature or fan speed, if I go
ahead and roll the fan speed up here,
you can see it responds pretty quickly.
Or if I want to change volume here, you
can see the liquid glass volume
indicator also moving around. So there's
a whole lot here that I'm still going to
do with physical buttons.
But in cars that have less physical
buttons, you do even more on the screen.
So this is even more important. So I
guess the real question is if you're not
Aston Martin, if you're a different one
of these car companies that is making a
car with a huge screen in it, what are
the chances you're not already very
focused on software? What are the
chances you're making a car with a huge
screen in it with a bunch of cool
software, but you're also willing to let
Apple take over the screens in your car
if the user has an iPhone? That's a
really weird question. I feel like, and
we've seen this from Tesla and from
Rivian so far, there are car companies
who are are pretty sure they don't want
to do that and they don't support
CarPlay at all and they definitely won't
support CarPlay Ultra. But now we've
slowly started to see this trickling
list of companies who are going to
support CarPlay Ultra. If you own an
Aston Martin already, I think you can
get your car to a service center and
they'll do a software update to support
it. So, it's starting. But my question
is, do you like CarPlay Ultra over
regular CarPlay? Would you be interested
in having like the extra themes and the
extra integration in a sort of an Apple
Car way? Does that entice you at all?
Because to me, it's just a little bit
more convenient, but otherwise it's Not
really too special. Let me know your
thoughts in the comments below. Thanks
for watching. Catch you in the next one."

confession. Um,
when I first saw this vehicle, I didn't
think it was real, but I was wrong. It
is. It's very much real. And, uh, it's
not even a I thought it was a concept
car. It's actually a real car that's
going to ship to people. And admittedly,
it's super rare and it's bespoke and
every single one is custom. But this is
now really crazy to see in person. This
is the Cadillac Celesteic. Celesteic.
It's their $350,000
ultra luxury EV and I think it even
though it is real, it's it's super
limited and to me it represents the peak
of electric vehicles or at least what
Cadillac thinks the peak should be. So,
I'm going to take a look at what that
looks like in person and then Miles is
going to drive it and we'll see what
that feels like. But for now, yeah, this
is the absolute apex of what Cadillac is
capable of, and you're not seeing
things. It is actually shaped like that.
It is uh the second longest vehicle I've
ever reviewed. It's 217 in long, the
only longer one being the Cadillac
Escalade IQ. Some basic specs, it is a
dual motor all-wheel drive EV with a
roughly 100 kWh battery, like I said.
Oh, y'all are getting kind of crazy out
here. Uh, it is a uh fully electric car.
It is $340,000
and it'll get about 300 mi of range. So,
it's not the biggest battery in the
world, but it's not just about the
numbers, it's about the experience. This
costs as much as a Rolls-Royce. This
costs as much as a Bentley. This has got
to be This has got to be good. And this
is the exact type of vehicle that's
meant to go electric and be the
quietest, smoothest, best version yet.
So, yeah, let's just jump inside. It's
also 8,000° outside. So, I'm very
excited to get inside this car. So,
we'll get past this really nice grill
with these really bright DRLs and this
massive hood and these huge Pilot Sport
EV. What are these? 20 22in wheels. Uh,
pass the charge port over here on the
side into this automatically opening
door that just like the Escalade IQ has
object sensors on the outside. So, it
throws the door open, but it never hits
the car next to you. And then you get in
to this all blue interior. Put a foot on
the brake. The door automatically closes
and lights up. The AC turns on cuz it's
hot and it's blue in here. This is a
crazy interior in so many ways. And a
lot of it is actually going to be
similar to that Escalade, but the more
you look around, the more they've taken
it to the extreme to be a very high
tech, very luxurious, very soft car. Uh,
and I I like a lot of what I see. Okay,
so the first thing that strikes me is
obviously you've got this huge screen
behind the steering wheel. Again, it
probably is the same part from the
Escalade IQ. You've got this second
screen over here that polarizes and
basically is invisible to me while I'm
driving. And then you've got all this
stuff in front of me, but it's extra far
away now. And it is still a touch
screen. It is still that very responsive
software, but now you'll probably be
more likely to control it with this
little crystal ball over here since it
is kind of far away to be controlling
that. You can't even actually do it
while driving. It won't let you. So, 55
in of screens. Check. Then you've got
these AKG speakers all over the cabin.
You've got them above you. You've got
them next to you. You've got them built
into the headrests in the speakers. You
got them down here. You've got woofers.
And they support Dolby surround. And
they sound quite good. And there's also
great cabin isolation, too. So, of
course, you'd expect awesome speakers in
a car like this. But then there's more.
Okay. So, you've got this blue steering
wheel. You know, whoever specked this
car clearly really liked blue. Then
you've got this second screen in the
center here. There's wireless chargers
behind. There's the controls here. And
you've got a single cup holder. And then
you've got these three little
silhouettes here that sort of represent
some heritage. I imagine there are
specific model numbers associated with
these, but there's the Celesteic there.
Okay. Here's another quirk. I'm sure if
Douggee has done a video about this car,
he's mentioned this. There's a center
console or a a center storage area here
where the left side opens like that. Two
USBC ports in there. Great. But the
right side slides back.
So there's your other cup holder. It's
actually spring-loaded to come back
closed here. But that's two different
opening mechanisms for that there for
your heated armrests to go along with
your heated and ventilated seats, which
also, like I said, have speakers up
here. And even have this, which is I I
don't know exactly what it's called. I I
tempted to name it myself, like the hot
breath vent or something like that. But
when you have the heated seats on, this
will actually blow hot air on the back
of your neck, which is I'm glad they
thought of that. That's a crazy feature.
Now, everywhere else in the car, there's
awesome materials. Like, basically
everything is leather or this like nice
carbon fiber trim here. Other than the
piano black, I'm loving the build
quality. Even up here, like all of this
and this nice strip light here for the
mirror. This is all great metal and
Alcantara, and it's all blue. And we
love the blue clearly. Uh, but something
I want to show you in this car is
there's a tint button up here. And the
tint button lets you control the sunroof
in sections. It's actually a zoned
electrochromic roof. So, I can go clear
on just my quadrant of the roof or just
me and uh let's say the rear passenger.
Like there's a lot of versatility here.
I I don't know if it makes that much of
a difference if the sun is right above
us. But I could theoretically shade one
person and and let the other person uh
get some sun, but if I ever want to go
all clear or all dark, I have those
buttons, too. So, let's go all clear.
It's pretty quick. And then all dark
turns them all dark, which on a thousand
degree day like today is probably the
way I keep it. I think on a lot of these
super super limited edition handbuilt
cars like these, my main concern is
usually that it feels so much like a
prototype, you might even have things
not work very well. But it seems like on
this car, everything is working well, at
least for now. Like the soft closed
doors work. These little tiny buttons,
while I think that would be terrible in
a winter in the Northeast, uh it is the
only way to open the door since there's
no handles, but they are working. And it
lets you get into this royally blue back
seat with the screens back here. And of
course, I can pull that real quick just
to have it close the door for me. Nice
soft clothes. God, there's so much blue
in here. This is the most berry interior
of all time. But it's comfortable back
here. I'm in, you know, 63 driving
position in front of me. Plenty of leg
room here. There's still all the climate
controls in the middle. Two more
wireless chargers, two more cup holders,
two HDMI ports for those screens, USBC
ports to charge your phone, storage for
days. I mean, this is uh this is a car
you'd want to be driven in just as much
as drive. And then you'll of course
notice behind me is a trunk because this
200inch long sedan is a hatchback. So,
the floor is kind of high, and I noticed
that if if there is stuff in the trunk,
it will slide around here, and it could
just slide into the cabin if you aren't
careful. Uh, if you break really hard,
that's kind of interesting. I figured
there'd be a barrier here. But, in
general, uh, plenty of storage, plenty
of stuff that you can put back here,
especially if you want access to it. If
you have like a backpack or something
behind you, you can just grab it. Uh, so
this is a good spot to be. And it's
really easy to access. So, I'll just
show you that, too. I think they've
thought everything through really well
here, too. By the way, lots of metal.
Lots of metal. It doesn't do the
Rolls-Royce dinging, but it is
definitely high quality materials.
And so, let's get back here. You've got
this tiny little spoiler, which does
actually move cuz it's automatic. And
the logo does the usual Cadillac logo
thing and unveils your premiumly
manicured hatchback trunk. I kind of
love when the detailers do this. It's a
makes it feel even more expensive. But
yeah, the floor is not that low. You've
got the charging materials in here. And
then this is the whole trunk space that
you got. So, you do have to lift
whatever it is you're putting back here
and put it in there. Wow, the license
plate fell off. That's so sad. I'm going
to put it back on, though.
But yeah, so weirdly, uh I am swayed. I
think this car has some nice angles. It
obviously has these massive lights and
these big sloping aerodynamic shapes.
So, you can see some of the DNA of the
Lyric and the Escalade IQ in it. But in
general, I think the reason that I and a
lot of people like the Rolls-Royce
Spectre and the Maybach and the crazy
big, you know, electric vehicles that
just have all the luxury in the world is
cuz it's the best version. The electric
version is is sick. But that means
nothing if it doesn't drive well. So,
uh, Miles, how does the Peak EV actually
drive? And I have an answer for that.
But first,
okay, let's let's drive this thing. On
paper, the only car you can really
compare this to is the Rolls-Royce
Specters. That's pretty much the only
other hyper customizable, hyper luxury
four-seater EV in this price bracket.
The BMW i7 and Mercedes-Benz EQS aren't
quite on this level when you consider
the fact that the Rolls-Royce Spectre
starts at about 100 grand more than this
car does. The Celesteic is kind of like
a bargain in comparison. But the kicker
is that there are many things I like
about the Rolls-Royce Spectre that this
car does a little bit better, if not
just as well in some areas for a lot
less money. So, first things first,
Super Cruise. That's why my hands have
been off the wheel because it's
hands-free as long as you're paying
attention. Super Cruise is just one of
the best assisted driver systems out
there in any car. We're not even talking
about cars that are fully electric. And
compared to what you have in the
Rolls-Royce Spectre, the assisted
driving features that that car offers,
this car is just super confidence
inspiring on major interstates like I am
right now or if you're sitting in
traffic on a local highway. Those are
the areas where Super Cruise shines and
just makes my roadgoing journey a lot
more peaceful, a lot less stressful. The
car is my chauffeur to an extent.
Obviously, there are many moments where
you have to take over and and always pay
attention to the road obviously. So, the
suspension, right? GM's magnetic ride
system is something that they've put in
a boatload of their cars, including like
the Corvette, but this version in the
Celesteic, it feels different. This is
the best riding GM car I've I've ever
driven. It just it just is. The adaptive
dampers are making adjustments up to a
thousand times per second, which is
really helping the Celesteic have that
floaty, cushiony, soft, pillow-like ride
that's very similar to the Rolls-Royce
Spectre. One thing where the Spectre
still is king is road noise and
isolation. This car is still decently
noisy on the outside. I'm hearing a lot
of the cars next to me that are flying
by. That's one area where the Spectre is
still king for sure, but it's livable.
It's not annoyingly loud, but certainly
a little bit louder than I would have
hoped for given how expensive this car
is and what the focus of this car is.
Now, the Celestic isn't a V series car
or a Blackwing by any sense of the word.
In fact, the only V series badging
you're going to find on this car is the
velocity max button on the steering
wheel, which gives you max power. But
this car does share some of the same
handling characteristics of a lot of my
favorite performance GTs, primarily the
Bentley Continental GT. This car reminds
me a lot of the Continental GT,
particularly the way it takes corners
because just like the Continental GT, it
is a chonker. It weighs well over 6,000
lbs. But despite that, it takes corners
a lot better than it should. And that's
because of the rear axle steering in
combination with the adaptive
suspension. Now, no one's going to be
using the Celesteic to carve canyon
roads or go down back roads or set track
records because that's not what this car
is for. That's not what it's about. But
given how much the car costs, it should
be at least good at everything and that
it is. It is pretty fun taking it down a
back road despite how big and long and
heavy it is. The Celesteic has 655
horsepower and 646 pound feet of torque.
So, it's in like the top five most
powerful Cadillacs ever made. And the
power is certainly there despite it
weighing a ton. But I've noticed that
there's a certain finesse and elegance
when it comes to how they've calibrated
this car for power delivery and
acceleration. The Ionic 5N, for example,
has a similar amount of power around the
600 horsepower mark. And when you floor
that car in sport mode, it's super
stabby. It throws you into the back of
your seat. And there's a fun factor
that's attached with that sort of stuff.
I mean, I like that sort of stuff, but
that's not what this car is. This car is
for the big kids. And so when you do put
your foot to the floor, it's very smooth
and linear and gradual. It really does
allow you to feel the horsepower and
especially the torque, but in a way that
makes it feel very elegant, very classy,
a very classy power delivery calibration
in this car. I've noticed even the regen
paddle, like I'm going to regen, even
the regen paddle is a lot less stabby
and aggressive as it is in other GM
products. Would I be upset if Cadillac
made a version of this car that had like
the twin turbo V8 out of the CT6
Blackwing or something like that? No, I
I would not be upset if they did that.
But this version, the electric version,
checks all of the boxes you're looking
for when it comes to a luxury
high-performance GT Cruiser. From a
driving perspective, it does all the
Rolls-Royce Spectre stuff and also
happens to be more fun to drive for a
lot less money. I see that as an
absolute win. At the end of the day,
this car I'm driving is unoptanium,
right? It's 350 grand. And even if you
do have the money for it, it'll still be
harder to buy than a Rolls-Royce Spectre
cuz you got to get on the list for it.
This is an exclusive, very limited
production car. This car that I'm
driving is just an idea, effectively, a
concept, if you will. But the idea is
that hopefully a lot of this tech
trickles its way down into cars in the
GM portfolio that mere mortals like
myself could hopefully afford at some
point. That's that's what you really
want to get out of experiencing or
looking at a car like this. But either
way, it's pretty sick to drive and a
really cool showcase of how if GM really
wanted to, they could potentially come
for the neck ofr.
So that's about it. Thank you guys for
watching. Thank you to Cadillac for
hooking us up with this car for a couple
of days. It's been pretty sick. That's
about it. Talk to you guys in the next
one. You'll have to pretend that I'm
putting my hand over the camera because
I am"

justified that the Cybertruck was not
going to have like a 500 mile range and
a huge battery because they wanted it to
have better driving dynamics and people
valued that over a big heavy weight and
a lot of range. Yeah, I remember that
too. And then they added that thing in
the trunk that they later cancelled.
Long story. But then GM said, ""Wait,
hold my beer cuz we're going to do it
anyway."" They decided that they would do
a couple vehicles with a 200 kWh
battery, including this one behind me.
This is the Cadillac Escalade IQ. I
think it's the biggest and heaviest
vehicle I have ever tested. 9,300 lb,
but what you get out of a massive
battery uh is a massive range. Actually,
the longest range I've ever tested in an
electric car. So, maybe people do want
that. So, I remember when they announced
this thing, this Escalade IQ, and I
remember seeing it in person and now
that it's actually on the street, God,
living with it. It is truly a living
room on wheels. Like, this is everything
you'd want from an electric Escalade.
And that's actually something I've been
saying for a while about certain cars.
Certain vehicles are perfect to go
electric. Oh, you want something that's
massive and luxurious and soft and quiet
and you don't really care if it's
extremely heavy and maybe a little
pricey. Okay, the electric one will be
the best version ever. Sound familiar?
So, yeah, similar to the Rolls-Royce.
Yeah, this is totally fine going
electric, and I think it's the best
Escalade ever. This might be the
official Uber Black of New York City in
like 2 or 3 years. So, the specs you
probably care about, 205 kWh battery.
It's an 800vt architecture with 350 kW
peak charging. It's dual motor all-wheel
drive and it will do a 0 to 60 in like
4.7 seconds in max velocity mode thanks
to about 750 horsepower with the press
of a button and it's about 130 grand and
Cadillac is quoting 465
miles of range. I'll say that again. 465
miles of range. And it's funny. I've
seen even better numbers on the dash
because the dash in this car as you're
driving, it's very responsive to how you
drive. So, you could stomp on the
throttle and it'll just drop 5 miles off
your range, but if you coast for a
while, it'll go way back up. I've seen
500 miles quoted in this car. So, on the
outside, it looks like an Escalade. It
also kind of looks like a like a Mega L,
like a bigger version of an Optic or a
Lyric. You've got this big Cadillac logo
at the front here in front of the front
trunk. This nice blue paint, which will
match the blue interior. I'll show you
in a second. But the DRLs and the
headlights and all this fancy Cadillac
grill and some real intakes. You get
around to the side and uh again scale is
kind of hard. So maybe it's a good thing
we have this little car back here. But
these are 24in wheels with Michelin
tires uh and a little bit of you know
plastic to help the aerodynamics. And
this thing cuts through the air well
enough to get as much range as it does.
You've got side indicators, big mirrors.
You've got a little bit of a sloped back
too. So, this is something a L also did.
And you have these big lights on the
back. So, I I think it kind of Yeah, it
looks like a mega L basically. And then
you've got that Cadillac logo at the
back here, which yes, always opens the
trunk when you've got the keys in your
pocket. And there is a good amount of
trunk space even with all three rows up.
And since we're here, I might as well
show you. These are powerfolding
third rows. Both of them will fold down
and power returning,
which is just so nice. And you can see
the blue leather. So, we'll get there.
But what else do you think about when
you think about the Escalade? Well, you
probably think about a big soft
luxurious driving experience. So, if I
just hit that button here, the door will
open for me. Yeah, it's lowered thanks
to the active air suspension.
It really likes beeping, but I'm going
to put my foot on the brake.
It's going to close for me. Nice. This
feature is really funny because it can
and it loves automatically opening the
first and second row doors, but it opens
the doors really fast. So, I'll do
another example here. If I just pull
this handle, it like throws the door
open real quick, which is nice. It's
convenient. I can get out now. But if
there's a car parked next to you, that
can be a little bit scary. Put my foot
on the brake here again.
Thankfully, there are sensors in the
door that control how far it opens. So,
if there is a car parked next to you,
it'll throw the door open till right
next to the car next to you, but it
never hits it. At least so far, it
hasn't hit it for me. And then, if you
want to control it on the screen, you
can obviously do it with this as well.
Very luxurious feature. Again, Uber
drivers are going to just be getting
five star ratings left and right with
this thing. But once you get in, yes,
you are greeted by a very luxurious
cabin, especially for the driver here.
It's got this big soft steering wheel.
It's heated. It's got the lights on top
for super cruise. It's also a 52in
display, or at least a set of displays
that totals roughly 52 in in front of
you here. So, this display behind the
steering wheel, obviously, this second
screen over here is all of your Google
services. So, it doesn't have CarPlay,
but it has the Google Play Store. It has
Google Maps, so you can drop in Spotify
or Ways or whatever else. You can drop
the maps in really quickly. It's very
responsive. That's a large display for
that. And a third passenger display over
to the right here, which only this
person can see when I put it in drive
because it's polarized and it flips it
on. And this just looks black to me when
I'm driving. So, that's really good. And
also any media that's playing over there
on those apps and all that Google
services stuff only plays through
headphones so that person through
Bluetooth can hear it, not the car
speakers. Then a bunch of great trim. I
mean the blue leather that I told you
about, these are uh ventilated and
heated and massaging seats and they are
really nice seats. There are speakers in
the headrests. Uh and then obviously a
bunch of bolstering and support and
really nice uh I actually think the uh
ventilation is very nice. It goes all
the way up your back. So, this is this
is a great place to sit. Only a minor
complaint from me. So, this screen in
the middle is very useful. And then
there's just a whole bunch of piano
black that just gets tons of smudges and
fingerprints. And every car that has
this, I complain about it. I don't love
it. But there's some room behind here to
store something. Wireless charger for
your passenger. Cooled wireless charger
for the driver. Massive center console
storage, which is where I have my NACS
adapter with two USBC ports, two cup
holders. This is good stuff. But the
living room on wheels experience
continues here because like I said, this
is a three row SUV.
Soft closed doors. Actually could go way
softer than that. But there's your
second row. Ingress and egress is great.
There's a lowered suspension and a
little stool there. I get in and I've
got a screen right in front of me. I've
got plenty of leg room with some storage
here. Again, a massive center console,
at least in this seven seat setup here.
So, you've got two wireless chargers.
You've got trays just like an airplane.
You can
close the door.
Nice. Uh, and you still have these
speakers in the headrest, so they don't
skip out on luxury in the second row at
all. Uh, and there's just so many
speakers in this car, so I might as well
talk about it now. This is a This is an
AKG sound system, which I don't hear a
ton of, but I think this might be the
best sounding AKG sound system I've
heard in a car. This has got great cabin
isolation. It's very quiet in here. So,
as you're driving, you know, you
basically only hear the speakers, the
suspension, and the tires do a good job
of minimizing road noise. And yeah, a
lot of speakers in here, including the
ones behind you. And there's there's
really good sound. So, I'm impressed by
that. And then behind me is the third
row. So, not as much room, but still
plenty for a third row. You often don't
think of a third row as being
particularly roomy. But the whole point
of a massive wheelbase and a huge
Escalade like this is you're actually
going to fill the seats with adults, and
you can do that here. There's less
headroom, and even though there's vents,
there's not as much uh sunroof doesn't
go all the way back there. So, it's
obviously not the best experience, but
as far as sevenseaters go, pretty good.
So, I'm going to get back to the front
seat because driving this thing is the
other important part of the experience.
If you're going to spend a hundred grand
and ride on 24in rims, you're going to
want things to be pretty excellent.
There's a soft closing demo for you. Uh,
and it turns out they are. Now, again, I
cannot emphasize enough how massive this
vehicle is. Okay, I'm I'm used to things
like the Lyric or the R1S or other three
row SUVs. God, it likes blinking a lot.
Uh, and driving in this, I'm looking
down at the roof of those other SUVs.
This is really high off the ground. This
is really wide. Actually, some some
things I noticed about how big this
vehicle is. First of all, this mirror is
nice to have because if you're trying to
see behind you, just with the actual
typical mirror, there's not a ton of
visibility. So, having the actual camera
instead of a mirror is super useful. But
then I don't like this mirror over here
on the right. This right mirror, you
know how they typically are a little bit
convex or concave or whatever and they
say objects in mirror are closer than
they appear. This one doesn't do that.
So it still has the blind spot indicator
and if there's a car in your blind spot,
it'll tell you by lighting that up. But
I it takes a lot of adjustment and I
still really typically have quite a
large blind spot right here behind me
and to the right in this car. Now,
thankfully, if I throw a blinker on,
actually, I must be in drive. I'm pretty
sure. If I go into drive and I throw the
right blinker on, it will show that
blind spot. So, if I'm driving and I
want to see if there's a car over to the
right there, make sure you hit that
blinker cuz you will see probably a car
sitting there that you didn't know was
there. Uh, but I thought that was odd
that that's a a pretty far reaching
mirror for some reason that doesn't show
the entire side uh while you're driving.
But again, you know, you get to driving
this thing and you get used to it. And
uh the experience is exactly what you'd
expect. Very, very soft suspension. The
air suspension is incredibly adaptive.
It lowers to let you in the car. It
rises up when you start driving and it
keeps things real soft, really isolated
from the road. You might go over a
pothole and not notice with a 24in rim.
That is crazy. Um and again, the range
is crazy good. So, I've I've had this
thing for a week and I have not charged
it. I've driven it every single day,
Monday through Friday, commuted, run
errands, groceries, shipping with UPS. I
don't know how many miles I've driven,
but it is pretty crazy to get down to
like 50% battery and see that you still
have 250 miles left of range. So, pretty
impressive stuff.
And on top of it all, it can be pretty
quick. So, there's drive modes. If I go
over here, I've been mostly driving in
to tour mode just because that's I think
the best setup for this thing. The
suspension is pretty soft. Steering is
pretty soft. There's not a whole lot of
of dynamics. You're not trying to feel
the road. Uh but there is sport mode and
that does increase the power quite a
bit. And then there's a V button here on
the steering wheel. If you hit that, you
see this little V thing light up. that
unlocks Vmax mode, which is 750
horsepower, which even though this
weighs 9,000 lb, that's still quick.
This thing is way quicker than it has
any right to be. Not sporty, just quick
passing quick, entrance ramp quick. So,
if you're into that, you can have it.
Uh, but really, this is just about
cruising around. This is just about not
feeling anything on the road uh and kind
of dominating the entire lane you're in
because that's how massive this vehicle
is. And then some other little things
about this living room on wheels. This
is a button to open the front trunk. And
I want to show you something about the
size of this enormous front trunk here.
Come take a look at this.
The front trunk is so big and so deep
that if you don't have long arms, you
can't actually reach all the way back
there into the front trunk. So, they've
included this nice little tray so you
can actually slide out
and reach the thing that got moved all
the way to the back of your front trunk.
Obviously, if you accelerate things can
shift around if you got groceries in
here. This is uh clever because this
massive front trunk can actually hold a
bunch of stuff. And then this is a truck
that also has four-wheel steer. So the
rear wheels will turn as well as the
front ones to really help this massive
thing pivot around its axis. So, while
it is huge and it never ever stops
feeling huge, uh, when you're in a
parking lot or like a a K turn type
situation or like a three-point turn, it
actually does a really good job of sort
of it has a tight turning radius, which
is nice. Um, so yeah, pulling into
Chargers, pulling into parking spots, it
is at least maneuverable in that way,
but you never you never feel like you're
in a huge vehicle, which is honestly
probably what a lot of people driving
this want. People want to be high off
the road. But like I said, I expect
these to be giving rides to people quite
a bit just as much as they are owned by
people who just want to drive a big
thing. But yeah, let me know if you're
into absolutely massive vehicles like
this. Me personally, I think I would
take something like the Volvo that we
just reviewed because it's just as quiet
inside. It has better speakers. It still
has three rows. It has an awesome
premium interior and the software is
amazing. And it's just not as huge and
doesn't have as big of a range.
But maybe you want 500 miles of range.
Maybe that customer that Tesla kind of
doesn't believe exists actually does.
Let me know if that's you. Thanks for
watching. Catch you in the next one.
Peace."

What's the most
interesting thing about this new second

might say it's the paint color. I don't
think so. A lot of people would say the
lights. This front light bar, if you
remember, the second gen is actually a
battery percentage indicator when it's
charging. 60, 70, 80, all the way to
100%. That's pretty cool, but it's not
that. For some people, it's the wheel
and tire package. This is the first time
they've done staggered wheels and tires.
new tire. Uh sticky Pilot Sport 5S on
this thing, but it's not that. Uh for
some people it's the new color. So blue
is the accent color. This teal blue on
the Rivian logo and on the new brakes.
Actually, it's the same brakes, just
painted blue. Uh that's for just the
quad. So if you see that or if you see
that Yeti logo, then the thing you're
driving behind has 1,000 horsepower.
But it's not that for me, or at least
for people in the US, I guess, I think
the most interesting thing about this
truck is the fact that it's the first
non-Tesla EV that I have tested with the
Tesla charge port built in. No adapter
needed, NACS. That's going to seem very
normal to people in Europe, but I've
been waiting for this for a long time.
So, apparently all the second generation
Rivians are now going to start shipping
with that. I've charged with it, plugged
it in, no problem.

Wow.
So, subscribers to this channel have
already seen me review and test the new
Gen 2 Riven R1S. I had the tri motor
here and it was pretty good. I liked it.
There were some things that were better,
some things that were meh, but I never
really fully answer the would I upgrade
question because uh I was waiting for
that one unannounced top-of-the-lineup
version, which is the quad motor. And uh
I figured that was the best comparison
AB-wise from what I have now, which is
the launch edition quad motor R1T. And
so now here we have a second generation
quad motor R1T. Finally, I saw those
launch videos of it. We saw the new
specs, but we didn't really fully
understand all of what it was. But now
we get to figure that out because I've
been living with this for the past week
or so. I've put like 1,000 miles on it,
fully moved into it, daedied it, and I'm
ready to answer the question of would I
actually upgrade from a Gen 1 to this
Gen 2. So, real quick, just as a
refresher, here's the things that I
noticed that were definitely good about
a new second generation Rivian. One is
the suspension. It rides way better. The
all-purpose mode is softer. The sport
mode is firmer. And that's even more
true about this R1T. The the ride is
just dramatically better than the first
generation. But there are a couple other
things that are different as well. These
new headlights, which I talked about in
that first video, I like uh the new
blinkers down here at the bottom. The
new front face, it's darker at the
bottom. So overall, that face is just a
little bit updated. You come around the
sides and on this quad motor, you'll
notice the quad because of this teal
color, these teal blue accents. So
around the Rivian logo there and also
this new brake package. It's the same
exact brakes actually. They're not
better brakes, but they are teal colored
on the front and on the back. And then
you have the new tano cover on the
second generation, which should break
way less often. Uh again, you get to the
back here and the way that you know you
have the quad motor is this little Yeti
down here at the corner. That's for the
quad. And you have this teal quad logo.
So if you see one on the street, that's
the way you know that you found the 1000
horsepower one that does a 10 and 1/2
second quarter mile and it's crazy fast.
These doors actually feel different to
open and they make a different sound
when they close. And then this new
handle is just a push button instead of
a big metal handle, which I actually
think is a bit of a downgrade. The roof
is electrochromic. So, if I go in here
and hit this button right here, you'll
see the roof
tint. Yeah, just like that or untint.
I don't use that very often, but you can
if you want to. Steering wheel is the
same. You have this new upholstery and
these slightly updated seats which are
not very different, but they're slightly
more comfortable in my opinion. And the
speakers in here are actually slightly
worse than the first gen. I am ready and
willing to admit that they are not as
good as the first gen speakers, but with
enough software updates, I think they're
passable. Also, one other thing I didn't
realize was going to start happening so
soon, but I am so happy to see is this
is the first non-Tesla EV that I have
tested.
Yes, with the NACS port. It's finally
here. All of the Gen 2 Rivians, they're
telling me, are going to start shipping
with the NACS port. So, I was able to go
to Tesla Superchargers and not have an
adapter and just plug the thing straight
in and it charged beautifully. This was
really cool to see. I assume when they
start actually shipping these, it's
going to be just straight up. You'll
have the NACS port. That is great. And
then the thing that's also different
about this truck versus mine is these
tires. So, wheels and tires. You have
this wheel package which is a little
lighter. And it's actually this sticky,
look at this, this sticky Michelin tire,
this Pilot Sport 5S here. And it's
actually a staggered setup. So, it's
305s at the back and looks like 275s at
the front. Uh, so it's a street tire.
So,
my truck that I've had for a while on a
full full charge, 100% charge with the
all-terrain tires on it gets 285 mi of
range right now. With a street tire, it
would get more, but it's not a super
high performance setup. It's just a
street and slightly off-road all-terrain
truck. 285. This truck, I was wondering
what it would get on a full charge
because Rivian has never quoted that and
never shown us. I charged it up to 100%
and on this tire it's showing me 310 mi
of range in conserve mode up to about
330. So it's not a ton more range to go
to this generation 2 max performance
versus generation 1 max performance.
You'd get more range out of the tri
motor, which is actually probably the
better buy for 99% of people. But this
is the one with the party trick. The
1000 horsepower, the launch mode, the
sub3 second like 0 to 60. It's the crazy
fast one. Even though the triple motor
is still really fast, I find that this
thing is crazy impressive what it's able
to do in a straight line. And
dynamically, like the suspension of the
R1T is somehow way better than the R1S.
Generally, I like my car, my R1T on the
all-terrain tires because I like to be
able to go on some sand or on some grass
or to hop over a mound or whatever we
need to do where I wouldn't want to do
that as much on these wheels and tires.
So, if I put all terrains on this, it
would kind of defeat the purpose. It
would be back to sub 300 mi of range and
it would be not able to put down the
1000 horsepower as well. So, not a huge
difference between the two cars.
Speakers, tano cover, brakes, colors,
like not a whole ton of differences, but
yeah, the the theory goes, you know, the
Cybert truck comes out, the Cyber Beast
is the top of the lineup and it is
ridiculously quick and gets a lot of
bragging rights. So, Rivian, when they
decide to do their fastest, just says,
you know, well, just beat that. Just
beat the Tesla Cyber Beast. And in the
process, they accidentally made a
ridiculously quick truck. All right, so
I already know that this truck is going
to be faster than mine. Mine is also on
all-terrain tires, so I don't expect it
to do great, but let's just see how much
faster this 1000 horsepower truck is
than my already ridiculously fast R1T.
All right, so I'm in the first gen R1T
quad motor. I'm running about 830
horsepower, 98 pound- feet of torque.
This should do 0 to 60 in 3.1 seconds
and 1/4 mile and 117. We're on the
Pirelli Allterrain tires. So, I'm not
exactly sure how well we're going to do.
There is no launch control mode. You
just punch it.
This is supposed to run a 10 and 1/2
second quarter mile, which sounds crazy.
What do you think it will actually run?
Realistically, I don't know. It's kind
of hot today, so the tires will grip,
but I don't know if it's going to be too
hot for the batteries and the motor. So,
let's call it 10 6 and 1/2, 10 7 maybe.
Ridiculous to be in the 10ens either
way, but let's see how they line up.
Let's do it.
Jeez.
Wow. He got me off the launch.
Wow. I am getting smoked. That's crazy.
Wow. It's not even close.
I'm capped at 111.
130 across the line.
He was behind me the entire time
and frankly I never saw him to my side
at one time during this race.
Yeah, I got capped at 111. So, you were
absolutely gone.
Mine's giving me a nice little readout
in the dash. It says I capped out at
130. I ran a 2.74 second zero to 60 and
a 1064 quarter mile.
I did say 1065, so that's about what I
predicted it would do. That's insane.
That's ridiculous. I did feel a tiny bit
of wheel slip. I don't even think it
matters. There are really, really fast
sports cars that are slower than this.
That's crazy for a pickup truck.
Do you want to see if you can get a
faster time or are you happy with that?
Selfishly, let's let's run it back one
more time.
Let's do it. I'm going to see if uh
slightly less battery but slightly
warmer tires. See if it makes any
difference. But this thing hooked pretty
darn close.
Yeah. Now that we have the race box in
there, I want to see what the real 0 to
60 is without 1 ft roll out and all
that.
Very excited to see the number.
[Music]
[Music]
Wait, how am I beating him? Am I beating
him?
Oh, wow. Oh, he got ahead of me that
time on those tires.
Am I beating? Oh, he's catching me. He's
catching me.
I got to walk him down. No problem,
though.
Oh, what the Wait, did I jump?
Oh, I didn't do launch control.
Wow,
that's crazy. So, if you don't do launch
control,
these trucks are incredibly close.
I think I might have jumped.
Two things. One, you got a better
launch. Maybe you jumped, maybe you
didn't.
But two, I didn't do the launch mode
that time cuz I assumed I was still in
it and I wasn't. And these trucks ran so
close. I feel I tapped out at 110 just
like you and we crossed the finish line
at about the same time.
Yeah, I was like I was so shocked that I
was ahead of you for that long even with
a tiny possible jump.
That's funny. Okay, so I I want to do
that one more time and put it back in
launch mode. I assume it would just
stay, but maybe we waited too long, so I
I'll go back.
Cool. I like this. We can pretty much
call this the the tiebreaker, if you
will. All right. So, I'm going to turn
launch mode back on for this and we'll
observe how much faster we get.
I anticipate it will be significantly
faster.
Prepare for launch. Here we go.
I got him on the launch.
Oh, that's definitely faster. Better
reaction time for sure. But he's smoking
me. He's gone.
I didn't launch as well as him, but the
high-end difference is crazy.
He's gone. He's out of there.
And I'm speed capped. 111.
These trucks are both so fast. And wow,
you run out of braking room fast, too,
cuz this is the same brakes.
Yeah, he got me. He definitely got me.
Launch mode brought it from a 344 to a
305 0 to 60.
That's still odd that you're not
cracking a sub 2. Is that what you're
seeing on the car or on the uh race box?
The car says 2.74. The race box says
3.05. So, I guess the car is giving me
roll out higher peak gforces, but I did
also feel tire slip. And I ran the same
106.
It is weird. You're not cracking the
crazy 0 to 60, but 1/4 mile is just
about what Rivian claims. I'm I got a
consistent 3.3 and then a 10 six. So
you're a full second quicker to the 1/4
mile.
Sounds like Rivian's claim is with roll
out as a lot of them are. You know, that
is a crazy 1/4 mile time though. And I
think just to put it in perspective, we
should race this against something a
little more exotic.
I might have something that that meets
that criteria, I think.
All right. Bet.
All right, Miles. What have you uh what
have you brought to this race here to
race the Rivian?
So, I have brought the Lamborghini Urus
SE. This car is effectively the result
of some Italians getting their hand on a
Volkswagen Tour and verbal tuning it
into a batterypowered behemoth. This has
789 horsepower, 700 lb feet of torque
from a twin turbo V8 and a 20some
kilowatt hour battery pack. So, it's
it's packing some heat.
Okay. So theoretically, if someone saw
one of these at a stoplight,
they could maybe be even. Is this going
to beat the Rivian or or not?
I I'm not sure. This is going to be
what, the third or fourth run for this
car, so it might be at a disadvantage
because of that. But also, it's pretty
hot, so these turbos are not enjoying
the super hot, humid weather either.
I'm hearing excuses. I have almost 95%
battery still, and you're in a $300,000
Lamborghini. I think I think you should
win, but we'll see. All right, I really
after all that talk, I got to definitely
hit this light. I got to nail this
light.
[Applause]
Wow. Absolutely demolished.
Holy. I am way out in front. This
Lamborghini is not going to catch me.
Absolutely demolished. See you.
Wow.
That wasn't exactly close.
I'll tell you what, it's a it's a party
trick, but it's a good party trick.
Uh-oh.
Yeah. You know, like I said,
the weather, the turbos. Plus, I feel
like the car has been sitting for a
while, so maybe we could run it once
more. And uh the Pirellis might be up to
temp now.
Okay, I got less battery. You got warmer
tires. Let's Let's hit it again.
That was pretty embarrassing. I'm not
going to lie. Um I'm not super confident
about this second run either. He was
probably a full second, maybe a second
and a half ahead of me.
Come on, Lamborghiniti. Prove to me that
you're more than an Audi. Please, you're
not just a Volkswagen
for this race. Should I try to walk you
down?
Sure. Yeah, we can. We can try that.
Okay. So, you just try to hit the light
like normal and I'll try to launch right
after you and see what happens.
Let's do it.
All right. Starting line one more time.
If I win, I win.
Well, let's hope that doesn't happen.
Make sure I'm in launch mode for sure.
That would be embarrassing if I wasn't.
Launch. There we go.
[Music]
This thing is squirly.
Oh, I left late. I left late. Uh, come
on.
Wow, I am sliding all over the place.
Please don't kill me, Erus. Please. Come
on. Come on. Oh, I'm going to run out of
room.
I specifically swiped to go to launch
mode and then it didn't go to launch
mode. I think it has to stage for like 1
second longer because I hit my 110 top
speed again and I clearly only did a 35
instead of a 32.
Wow. Yeah, this one was pretty
straightforward. Once you turn ESC all
the way off, it's just slam brake, slam
throttle, and you're off to the races
and trying to survive while skidding all
over this drag strip.
All right, let's see if we can do one
more time and actually nail this.
Hopefully the party trick does the party
trick thing.
Yeah, I don't know what is up with the
stability.
But yeah, these tires do not seem to be
a big fan of this drag strip. This is a
fully prepped surface and I'm just
sliding all over the place. I don't get
it. I'm going to stage first and make
sure I get all the way into the launch
mode.
Here we go.
Oh, he got me. Oh, that's world like it.
Oh my god, it's so much faster.
Absolutely annihilated off the line and
I'm still sliding around like god knows
what. Jeez.
I almost went into the other lane.
[Applause]
Their claim 0 to 60 may not be spot on
because of roll out, but you know, I
think that 1,00 horsepower part is is
pretty real.
Yeah, I think uh add this one to the
list of vehicles that have a 1000
horsepower sometimes,
but they definitely have it. I may have
lost the race, but I will say when you
combine the sound of that epic V8 and
the lack of an ability to keep this
thing in a straight line going down the
dragstrip, it's certainly more exciting
drag racing this car than the Rivian in
my opinion.
One thing I've always enjoyed about
these EVs is I can hear all the other
cars on the road better.
Either way,
we took the L unfortunately.
But you know what? I'm in a twin turbo
V8 hybrid power super SUV.
Did I really lose? So, okay, here's my
conclusion. Now that we've gone to the
drag strip and we've really observed
what this thing is capable of, I got to
say this new Gen 2 so impressive what
it's able to do on a drag strip or, you
know, theoretically on an unprepped
surface. It's going to be the quickest
production pickup truck on the street.
If you want to be the king of the road
in that way, this is what you should
get. To the answer for the question,
should I would I actually upgrade from
the first gen launch edition? Uh, no.
No, I don't feel the need to. I I like
what this is capable of. And the
suspension is by far the biggest
difference versus my truck, but
everything else that this does is so
similar. Uh, just NVH is similar. Uh, I
wish I had an NACS port on mine, but you
know, that's one difference. The tunnel
cover is slightly different. The front
trunk's slightly smaller. The speakers
are slightly worse. The seats are
slightly different. Like, there's not a
whole The door handles are a little
worse. I'm going to keep my truck, but I
think if you were thinking about buying
a Rivian now that this is in the lineup,
this is the nice top-of-the-line
expensive one that's going to make all
the others seem like a better deal or
even get yourself a Gen One for a bit of
a discount. It's a nice truck. I'm going
to miss it, but I'm sticking with mine.
Let me know what you think, though.
Would you upgrade from Gen One to Gen
two? Or what do you like about this one?
Thanks for watching, and also let us
know if you enjoyed this new fun style
of video, and hit subscribe if you did.
Catch you in the next one. Peace."

day about if the electric car is
actually the future of cars guaranteed.
And I don't know if that's actually
necessarily definitely true. But what I
do know to be true is the electric motor
specifically.
Well, that's coming. It's actually
basically everywhere. So much everywhere
that even the Porsche 911 can't resist.
This is the newest 992.2 generation
Carrera 4 GTS. And you can see that
badge down here at the bottom. It says T
hybrid because there is an electric
motor in the turbo specifically. Now, I
was very, very interested in testing
this new generation specifically because
Porsche does not take changes to the 911
lightly. Anything that they do will be
scrutinized and analyzed to the nth
degree because it's an iconic car and
making the first hybrid version of it is
a huge deal. So, they must have a really
good reason to. And turns out, I agree,
really good reason. It's not the typical
hybrid, though. Some people would argue
you don't even really need to call it a
hybrid just because there are electric
motors and a bit of a new battery. We'll
get to that, though. The basics, though,
are this is still a 911. Carrera 4 GTS
is a all-wheel drive GTS, and it's
really expensive. Priced as tested, just
under $200,000
for a 3.6 6 L re-engineered flat 6 with
that electric motor we talked about, a
1.9 kWh battery. Now, like I said,
Porsche does not make a whole ton of
changes to the 911 without really good
reasons. So, from the outside, it's
going to mostly look like the same car
as last year and the year before and the
generation before. There are very few
subtle changes that they actually decide
to make. For example, the easiest way to
know you're driving next to a 992.2 is
these new shark fin gills in the front
here. I actually didn't like the way
these look at first. In pictures, they
don't look nearly as good. But something
about like a lot of this matte plastic
at the bottom versus the glossy. And
these are also active, so they open up
more in sport plus mode and when the
brakes need cooling and you need more
air flow and then they'll close like
this in regular driving. I kind of grown
to like it. It looks really good. This
is the whole front diffuser. Not bad. On
the side, obviously, not a whole lot
different other than the T hybrid badge
that I keep pointing out on both sides.
Still some good thick tires and 21in and
20in wheels. And then this is the back.
This one I I don't like that they have
this uh this fake exhaust tip. See how
it's disconnected from the actual
exhaust. I mean, you wouldn't know that
unless you walk right up to the car, but
I feel like on a $200,000 Porsche, like
you could connect those, I guess. Aside
from that though, very normal looking
back of a 992 generation car. That is
also active arrow. That spoiler goes up
and down. Okay, it's still a 911. So,
all right then. T- hybrid. What does
that mean? This is the first hybrid 911,
which is a huge deal. What does that
actually mean for this car? What is
included? Well, there's the 1.9 kWh
battery and there's the two electric
motors that I talked about. In total, it
only adds maybe 50 kg to the entire
weight of the car. So, not that much.
Virtually undetectable while driving.
And it doesn't even really change the
packaging. It is a reworked engine to
get the electric parts in there. Uh, but
the front trunk, for example, is still
the exact same size. So, in a 911 where
you want that practicality, the battery
is actually right back here. If I take
this plastic cover off, should I take it
off? All right, I'll take it off. I'll
show you where the battery is. Take this
whole thing off. There's the 1.9 kow
battery. So, the flirt trunk that lives
up here is still the same size, and it's
great. In fact, the packaging is so
good, I think if you just put a regular
person in this car and sat them down and
told them to drive it, they would not be
able to tell that it's a hybrid. It's
not a plug-in hybrid and at no point do
the electric motors ever drive the car.
There is no electric mode. But what
they've done with this is very clever.
So without doing a whole history lesson,
basically turbos are very common, are
very popular in these quick cars. And
you probably also know that turbos come
with some amount of lag. So, you'll put
your foot down and then that boost
pressure will have to build up until the
turbo is ready to go and is giving you
the most boost. Now, putting an electric
motor right in the front and keeping it
spun up constantly will actually be able
to keep the air flowing quickly and keep
it always on boost all the time. So,
what they did with this car is instead
of having twin turbos like the Turbo S,
for example, where you can hopefully
have a smaller turbo that builds boost
pressure faster, this is one huge turbo,
but because the electric motors keeping
it spun up all the time, it's basically
always ready to be right on boost. And
as you drive, there's essentially no
turbo lag. It's kind of amazing knowing
how big the single turbo is in this car
and driving this around and feeling like
you're always getting a responsive pedal
all the time like a naturally aspirated
engine is great. It's awesome. You
wouldn't necessarily know that that's
because of the turbo or because of the
electric motor, but it is and it's
hugely awesome. So, I I definitely
appreciate that. Now, here's the other
uh small benefit. You know, this is the
992.2, too. So, this is the fully
digital tachometer up here. And there's
also sadly uh a generic start engine
button instead of, you know, the
remember the turnkey start the the
heritage. Remember that? Anyway, you
press this and and and take a listen to
how it sounds when you press this.
[Music]
I don't know if you caught that. It's
kind of hard to catch on this mic, but
there was no ignition sound. the engine
just spun up and just started right away
because of that other electric motor. No
crank to start. The electric motor just
starts the engine. And uh this totally
reworked engine actually sounds a little
bit different. I I'm going to try to get
a good clip of uh the engine note so you
can hear it.
It's kind of nice. I think it kind of
sounds similar to the V8 from the
Cayenne GTS, actually. Uh, so it's
always got this low rumble. And as you
drive this car, because of the turbos,
because you're always essentially given
almost instant boost, you mostly drive
around under 2500, 2,000 RPM, and it's
happy to sit under 2,000 RPM. Those
other twin turbo cars, you know, you sit
around in normal mode and they feel
almost kind of bogged down. If you read
or watch any other reviews, people
instantly flip to sport mode so they can
drive around at higher RPM. This car is
happy to sit at lower RPM and still feel
responsive, which is awesome. So, the
conclusion that I've come to after
driving and living with this car for a
couple days now is um I get why Porsche
did it. It is that engineering
masterpiece that the 911 always is. This
is the most responsive single turbo
setup ever in a production car. And it's
so good of a hybrid that you can drive
it and not really ever know it's a
hybrid. Of course, there is also the
emissions reasons why they've done this.
Of course, you'll also probably get
slightly better gas mileage from driving
around at lower RPMs, but as you drive
the 911, the GTS, the character of the
GTS is still very much alive. It is
still confidence inspiring and planted.
Rear wheel steer is standard. It is
still incredibly wellb built. It is
still super practical. All the space in
the back. The front trunk is the same
size. The packaging is great. I love
black wheels. I don't even think you
need the carbon ceramics. I think these
brakes, which are still drilled, are
fantastic. It's just a slightly new
insides, which I would argue have
basically no downside. The slightly
heavier weight is basically
undetectable. And uh I think it leaves
the only downside of this car really
being that it is so freaking expensive.
the prices keep going up for 911s and
people keep buying them because they're
still great cars. But other than that, I
think they've done uh surprise an
incredible job. I uh I still prefer
the older uh 992.1.
Some things about it, and this is this
is me feeling like I'm becoming that old
person who I always thought it was weird
that they prefer the older Porsches, but
now I'm immediately that guy. I like the
turnkey ignition start as small as that
is. I like the analog tachometer as
small as that was. Uh but if you're if
you're in the market for a new 911,
yeah, this thing's great obviously.
Thanks for watching. Catch you in the
next one. Peace."

when we first started having EVs come
out, every single new one got compared
to Tesla, whether they deserve to or
not, because there weren't that many
electric options. Now, there's some like
tons of options in every single segment.
So, if you specifically want a three row
fully electric SUV, well, you can get
the Catalike Escalade or the EQS or the
Rivian R1S or the Kia EV9.
But this one right here, I think stands
out as the best bang for the buck in
that crowded segment. I mean, you could
get a Lucid Gravity for well into the
six digits, or you could get a really,
really wellsp speced Hyundai Ionic 9 for
under 80 grand. Now, it might sound
weird to say bang for the buck when the
car is still 70, 80 grand, and that's
still expensive, but this category is
expensive. Lucid Gravity, like I said,
the R1S regularly is six figures. the
EQS, the Cadillacs, these are all
expensive vehicles. And now that I flew
with this for a week, it definitely has
all of the same features as those. It's
really well equipped, but for less
money. So, let's just start with those
basics. This is 110 kWh battery in
between a dual motor system, all-wheel
drive, and it does about 420 horsepower
and 500 lb feet of torque. I'll talk
more about how it it actually drives a
little bit later in this video, but then
it does about 320 to 340 miles of range
on a single charge. And okay, this is
I've been waiting a while to be able to
do this. This is one of the first EVs
I've seen slash tested with.
Got to go all the way to the back here
for it. The NACS port. This is a
nonTesla with the Tesla charge port in
the US. So, we're going to start seeing
these more in 2025 and 2026. This
doesn't mean you can charge at every
single Tesla supercharger, but without
an adapter. Some Tesla Superchargers
will let you just plug right in. It's
best to just check the map just to make
sure cuz you don't want to pull up to
the charger and then realize this is not
one of the ones that works. It's easy to
do that. Uh but yeah, Tesla
Superchargers with no adapter. Better
some of them than none of them. If you
want to get the closest on paper, that
would be the Kia EV9, which this shares
a platform with. Uh, but this is
obviously an Ionic, so it's got this
very unique pixel aesthetic at the front
with these headlights and all these
squares. I really like the Ionic 5 and I
think that looks even better than this.
But, you know, as far as big three row
SUVs go, this is a pretty unique look.
There's your headlights down there, your
daytime running light pattern up there.
Pretty big logo. A whole bunch of black
plastic, but still even like the squares
are are subtle, but they're consistent
with this motif. You get around to the
side, it's got these big thick sidewall
handcooked tires. I think they are what?
It's going to start with a four. Yeah,
285 45 21in wheels. Uh, and so those big
thick tires improve your ride quality.
Again, we'll get there. You got door
handles that recess. This is kind of
also like a satin paint color, too. It's
silver, but it's not super reflective.
And then this back is also very
distinct. Look at all these boxes. You
know what that reminds me of? you know
that Rivian delivery van which has the
lights that go all the way around the
top of it. This DRL setup, it kind of
gives me some of the same vibes, but
obviously it's an Ionic 9 instead. You
know, if you made me choose like what's
the best looking three row SUV, I I
don't know if I would pick this one. I
think it's it's nice and square and trim
and handsome. I think I'd probably pick
the Kia EV9 aesthetics slightly over it.
Maybe that's just me. Uh, but I think we
should get to the inside because I think
that's exactly where you start seeing
the value for the money. So, Ionic 9 on
that door handle and again down here and
again down here.
But as soon as you get to the driver's
seat, okay, I already have the AC turned
on cuz it's about 1,000°. In fact, what
does it say? It's It's only 89 right
now, but it's going up to 98. It's going
to be a billion degrees in here. So, I'm
going to have the AC on. Sorry. But this
is where you start seeing how well
equipped this thing is. There's a lot of
good features here. I'm going to I'm
going to go left to right because that
makes it easy. So, to the left of the
driver, you got this nice perforation in
this soft door over here. You got
storage down here. And you've got the
Bose speaker system. And the Bose
speakers all around this car, I think,
sound pretty good. If I was giving them
a rating, they'd be like a B. They're
not bad. And I specifically paired my
phone to this, so I'm doing Bluetooth
audio, and there's good stuff coming out
of these speakers. You also have this
plastic door handle, but you've got
memory seats over here. You've got power
folding and power adjusting mirrors,
which look pretty good. Then you get to
the middle. There's your steering wheel.
You've got plenty of controls for media
on the steering wheel, as well as the
screens behind it. You have an HUD,
which is nice and crisp. Of course, the
camera doesn't Hey, there you go. You
can pick that up. Uh, and then you have
a second screen over here, which
supports CarPlay, Android Auto, both
wireless. You can drop your phone down
here with wireless charging. It tends to
heat up the phone, but you can drop it
there if you want to. Two cup holders, a
little bit of storage in here. I uh I
want to say real quick, I think this key
is ugly. I don't know if a lot of people
usually comment about the key fob when
they review a car, but this even though
it's functional and everything, it just
this is just ugly. But there's a spot
right there to put the key fob when
you're driving. So, if you care about
that, there's some more storage here and
some more storage underneath here. and
then a decent mix of touchscreen
controls and physical controls. So, this
is a touchcreen and it's very responsive
and their software has been great for a
while, but then like having to hit this
tiny button for the fan speed, I I don't
love that. I think that's kind of lame.
You got the physical movement for uh
pointing the vents or opening and
closing the vents. And then you've got
controls like home here will always take
you home. If you want to go to CarPlay,
that'll always jump in there. So, these
are functional. You start to get to know
them. You also have controls on the
steering wheel. There's your volume.
There's your track forward and backward.
It's probably going to start playing
now. That's copyrighted. My fault. And
then you've got these paddles behind the
steering wheel to increase and decrease
regen. And there, like I said, is the
range. It's saying like 220 mi of range
with 64% battery. It's overstating at
least telling me it's going to get more
range than I was quoted when, you know,
you first learn about the car. It says
310 mi of range. Seems like it can get
like 330 or 340. Anyway, let's finish
off to the right here. This is a start
stop button that you do actually have to
press to turn the car off. I don't love
that EVs all kind of do that still, but
that's the button. And then you have
this twist to go into drive or push to
park. Then over here you have your mode
selector for what drive mode you're in.
So, sport, normal, or eco. And then you
also have auto hold on and off and to
turn on and off the parking cameras real
quick. Great. And then also this little
uh marble accent piece I don't love.
It's clearly plastic, but it does kind
of shine the LED lights onto it, so you
can see it at night, and it kind of has
this nice glow, but I don't know, that's
not my favorite piece. Uh, this screen
kind of curves a little bit as well. And
then, boom, look up here. This is a rear
view camera. You can switch it on or
off, although I tend to leave it on. So,
the mirror itself is still a fine mirror
if you want that, but this camera is a
little bit lower than before. I think it
was maybe the Ionic 5 or some previous
EVs have had it higher up pointed down
at the road. This is more like at bumper
level. Either way, it's super useful.
And then these seats are very
comfortable. I've been sitting in them
happily for days. They are ventilated.
They are heated. You can move them
forward and backward without sitting in
them. And we'll get to the other rows in
a second, but this is nice. You also
have this sunroof that opens and closes
and has a motorized cover. And just in
general, well equipped is the theme
here. Uh you can actually turn on the
massaging seats for a long drive if you
want to. I almost never do. I don't
really care about them, but you have
them. Has anyone ever bought a car
because of the massaging seats? That's
my question to you. Have you ever bought
a car and been like, ""Oh, I can never
buy another car without massaging seats
again."" Because I've never experienced a
good massage from a car seat before.
Maybe. Maybe that's just me, but hey,
this is a three row SUV and definitely
not a minivan. So, second and third row
space is a very big deal. So, these are
the captain seat setup. So, they've got
two large middle seats with a gap
between them and then a third row. This
second row is nice again cuz you have
this opening and closing sunroof. The
bar in the middle doesn't bother me too
much. I like that it can open and close.
And then plenty of foot room. There's
room for my feet under the seat in front
of me. And of course, you've got this
this nice net here. A lot of people
actually love this net. Uh maybe if you
have babies in the back seat, this is a
nice shade for them. But that net is
there. The aesthetic is matched. Two
more cup holders. Two more cup holders.
Hold on a second.
Cubby storage space and more HI controls
back here. This is a nice back seat, but
there's three rows. So, let me just go
ahead and shimmy back here real quick.
This is not the easiest, but it is
possible. There you go. So, third row I
wouldn't want to sit in. I'm 6'3. I put
a 63 driving position. And then I have
another seat in front of me here. So,
not the most leg room, as is pretty
typical for this class, but it is
possible. Also, if I'm the only one in
the back, I tend to stretch my legs out.
Two more cup holders. Another cup
holder. forward and backward motorized
seat movement. I'll get to that in a
second when I go to the trunk. But also,
there's a lot of USBC
uh charging everywhere, especially if
you're in the second row. That's going
to be useful, too. So, not bad. Bose
speakers get back here. Vents get back
here. I'm fine in the back seat for a
short ride. This is a normal throw SUV.
When I say well equipped, though, that
actually really means a lot when it
comes to the back because, you know,
people store things in these massive
SUVs. So, this button over here at the
corner gives me my power opening
tailgate,
which shows me a pretty reasonable
amount of storage space before I even
fold anything down. Like, that is plenty
of space for groceries or whatever.
There's a tiny bit of sub trunk, so
cables, maybe some grocery bags. Um, but
then over on the side, you have the 110
volt outlet. That is nice. And then
these buttons here are pretty key
because this is power folding second and
third row. So, if I hit this third row
right side button, it's going to
powerfold this seat down, flips the
headrest down, and gives me a flat floor
to put whatever I want in. That suddenly
becomes much more storage. I can fold
both of these down. But second row does
the same thing. So, I hit the second row
right side. This is going to move the
seat up, fold this down, and give me
even more flat floor. So, now I can fit,
if I fold all these seats down, I can
fit a m I can fit a bicycle back here.
here. I can fit massive boxes, whatever
amount of storage you please, cuz that
is super useful. And then a lot of
these, you've probably seen other cars
where like you can hit the button, it'll
fold them down, but if you want to pull
them back up, you got to like really
reach inside. But not with this. This is
powerfolding back up. Both of these rows
will powerfold themselves back into
place to return to being useful seats. I
do have to manually do that, but that's
it. That's awesome. Super well equipped.
So, as you can imagine, living with this
thing with this amount of storage and
all these features and the NACS port and
the great range is is great. But then
there's also driving it. So, what's that
like? Well, it's about what you'd
expect. It's nice. This is a very, very
quiet, soft, plush SUV. I say quiet,
first of all, because the cabin
isolation, and I think there's also A&C
at play here. Uh either way, sitting
inside here is very quiet and
comfortable. And then the combination of
the soft suspension built in, the thick
sidewall on these tires. And just the
overall tuning for a smooth ride has
been really, really comfortable. It's
also, I mean, it's it's the little
things like it's a big, pretty soft,
plush steering wheel. It's the general
lack of distractions when you have this
much visibility and, you know, a pretty
reasonable, you know, small display in
front of you on the HUD and just riding
and cruising along. Yeah, it has a
sports mode. Who cares? Uh, it is quick,
actually, just to be frank. Like, it's
all-wheel drive, it's dual motor, and
it's 5 400 something horsepower. Um, but
in general, if you're if you're doing
road trips, I love that it's the NACS
Sport. I love that it's well over 300
miles of range, and it's like an honest
300 miles of range, too. and it seems to
have no issues with, you know, just
basic like being able to change the
amount of regen on the fly. And, you
know, if you're cruising on the highway,
maybe you just want to put it in coast
and do that for a while. But if you're
in day-to-day bumper-to-bumper traffic,
having the regen is efficient. All this
stuff is nice. Uh, so I have no
complaints about driving this thing. You
feel the weight when you're turning.
Sure. I think it's like 6,000 lb. But
again, almost nothing in this class is
tuned to be super sporty other than
maybe like the quad motor R1S or some of
those. Uh, so I think this does a good
job of being nice, soft, and comfortable
all the time. I think my only real
downsides with this, honestly, are
pretty minor. I'll give you my top
three. One is this looks and feels
pretty cheap. Two is this looks and
feels even cheaper. It's functional, but
god, I just I hate looking at it. And
three, uh I think the front trunk, which
honestly they probably don't expect
people to use very often, uh is pretty
tiny and honestly I'll probably never
use it, but I'll show it to you anyway
just so you can tell. This is the Ionic
9's front trunk. It's already full of
cables. These are adapters for the NACS
port and a charging cable. So, small
front trunk, not particularly useful.
That's a tiny third downside. But
overall, I mean, I'm impressed. Satin
paint, pixel lights, they're growing on
me. The aesthetic is growing on me. I'll
admit it. I think it's pretty handsome.
But let me know what you think. Is this
the best equipped sub $80,000
fully electric three row SUV? It's a
pretty specific category, but there's a
lot in it. I think this might be the
one. Let me know if you'd pick this or
the Kia EV9 in the comments. Thanks for
watching. Catch you in the next one."

have his silent electric startup and the
back seats and all the cargo space. And
it's even a little bit more of a
conservative design that a Lamborghini
usually is, but mom can have her 790
horsepower and her exotic wing and the
exhaust and all the fun of a
Lamborghini. And then I can have my
favorite thing, which is all the tech in
the car because Lamborghini has 11 drive
modes in this car. So, of course, I'm
going to show you all of them. Hop into
the driver's seat with me. Over here in
the middle is where you can start up
your car into either strata mode for
street, sport mode for sport, Corsa for
the racetrack setting, Sabia, which is
sand, terra for off-road, and ne which
is snow and ice. Or if you want to go
fully EV, you can do that, Dad, or
hybrid mode or battery recharge mode or
battery performance mode, which turns
all the electrons into going forward.

iX, and I stand by everything that I
said about it. It rides well. It's
comfortable, spacious, has good range.
The only issue is that BMW hit it with
the ugly stick, but now they've
refreshed it. There's a new generation
of BMW iX, so you be the judge. Did they
fix it or not? See, BMW did about as
well as you could expect them to.
There's new battery tech underneath,
giving it a larger range, which is
awesome. And it also lowered the price.
It was starting in the 80s. Now it's
starting in the '7s. It's still a great
ride. It also still has a high
performance Mv variant. It also still is
an incredibly comfortable interior with
these awesome seats. It still has all
the screens and all the tech and the M
steering wheel and the crystal. And it's
also still a CCS Sport, by the way. When
are we going to see the NACS American
EVs that are non Tesla? That's another
story for another day. But we're
concerned now with the looks. Did they
fix it? Is this new diffuser a little
less ugly? Are these new wheels a little
less terrible? And are these new
headlights and this new plastic grill
and these new air intakes a little bit
less Angry Birds and a little bit more

kind of ugly, but if you can get over
that, just like the last generation,
there's still a really good car under"
4p1f3KA_O2o,Cadillac Optiq - Loads of Luxury with a Huge Asterisk!,"The Cadillac Optiq does the whole luxury thing pretty well!

the Cadillac Lyric and there weren't
that many on the road and I declared it
underrated cuz I loved that thing and it
was it was super good for the price. And
so, I suddenly see them on the road all
the time now and it feels like I was
justified in saying that. Then I saw
Cadillac was coming out with a sort of a
little brother smaller version called
the Optic. And my first thought was,
okay, maybe this is going to kind of
feel like the Model 3 to the Model S
where it's actually probably better for
most people. It's smaller, it's cheaper,
and even though the Model S is the
flagship and it's great, you should
probably get the Model 3. But I actually
don't think that's how you should think
about this car now that I've driven it.
I think there's a different angle that
makes more sense that makes the optic
also pretty sick. Now, I still think the
same thing about the basics, which is
yes, the optic is a Lyric Junior. That
is still the best way to think about it.
It's the same category as a Lyric, but
it's a little bit cheaper and a lot
smaller. So, it's going to start in the
50,000s and a little bit smaller
wheelbase, a little bit less total
storage, but still definitely a little
crossover thing. If you've thought about
some of the other cars I previously
reviewed not that long ago, the Volvo
EX30, uh the Tesla Model Y, or even uh
like the Ionic 5 cars in this class, and
if you look at those and you think those
those are all so so simplistic, so so
minimal inside, I really want something
that feels like luxury for this price.
For an EV, that is the strength of the
Optic. This thing still looks great in
like 97% of the same ways that the
Lyrics did. Like look at the front here.
You still have these big vertical DRLs.
They do a light show when you first come
up to the vehicle. A big plastic fake
grill here, but the Cadillac logo one on
the front. And then there's the actual
vents at the bottom. You go to the side,
it's on these dark 21-in wheels. I kind
of like these wheels, too, but I'm I'm a
sucker for black wheels, so maybe it's
just me. Uh, you get to the side
profile. It looks I mean, if you didn't
know better, you might think you're
looking at a Lyric. Um, but then of
course you have these cool door handles
which open from the front instead of the
back. That's a nice little touch. Some
people don't like moving door handles,
but I think that's cool. And then you
have this this sort of sleek design
element here at the back. There is
actually a window in that back. You can
kind of see the outline of the window
right there. But they make the the big
design detail kind of look like the
Lyric. And then you get to that butt. I
mean the the back the tail lights uh
which again with the vertical lines look
a lot like the L. And then you have the
brake light up here. So this from the
back is very recognizable. still like a
a related car. You also have a a little
rearview mirror camera right there. And
then you hit that logo. And of course,
that'll open up your trunk to show you
still actually a very respectable amount
of storage space. You also have the sub
trunk for your cables if you want to
drop some in there, but obviously way
more than ideal for grocery shopping or
transporting stuff around. The seats
fold completely flat if you want to fit
a whole bicycle in there or something
crazy. So, you're not missing out on a
whole lot. It's technically smaller than
a L a little bit, but not too bad. The
big difference here with the optic over
its competition is going to be on the
inside. So, real quick, I'll show you
the charge port, which is CCS and
motorized, and you know, does the whole
Cadillac presentation thing, but the
optic is about the inside. So, I think
we should sip into the driver's seat.
Now, the thing that Cadillac will never
say about this vehicle, is that it is
essentially a fancy Chevy Equinox, kind
of like the same way the Lyric is a a
fancy Chevy Blazer made by the same
company. It's essentially the same
vehicle platform, but with a very
different interior, but that interior
makes a really big difference in the way
it feels and the way you think about a
vehicle like this. I mean, these seats
are heated, ventilated. They can massage
you. You turn around and look at all the
materials in here. This is a nice
feeling sort of fabric material. There's
plenty of leather with nice stitching.
Even things that aren't metal kind of
feel like metal. There's a lot of really
good looks and even some color, this
blue trim up here at the front that make
this feel luxury. I mean, again, throw
back to something like a Model Y or a
Volvo EX30 or even the Ionic and you'll
notice there is a there's a big
difference in just the way it feels. And
then also technology- wise, there's a
lot going on here, too. So, there's an
HUD up there, which is nice. Uh, you do
have some storage space down here. And
then there's another little bit of like
cubby storage in here with two USB
type-C ports, so you could throw a phone
in here wired. Uh, we'll get to that in
a second. There's also a glove box.
Unfortunately, that's the only way to
open it on the screen, but that's nice,
too. You have these nice vents which
kind of point around in the same way
that the Lyric does and open and close
with a rotation over here. I don't love
the piano black, but you do have this
nice seat adjustment up in the door
instead of down to your side. So, that's
nice. Good amount of door storage with
that blue trim. It looks nice in here.
Uh, I think people who are used to, if
you've seen a Lyric, obviously you're
going to find it familiar. Also, huge
shout out to Super Cruise being
standard. So, you have that little
indicator on the steering wheel. You
have this here and super cruise controls
right here. So, that being standard on
an optic is lovely, which you might not
like as much. Uh, which is also going to
be true about the Lyric is this huge
touchcreen back here. And this left side
here is also a touch screen. Over here
though, it is essentially Google stuff.
You got the Play Store, you've got
Google Assistant. There is no CarPlay or
Android Auto, but if you want Maps, it's
Google Maps already. You can sign in
with your Google account, kind of just
like it's your phone, and do all the
same stuff. If you want Ways, if you
want Spotify, if you want Alexa, Amazon
Music, you can just throw it on the
screen here by signing into the Play
Store. So, that's all still there. If
you like that, great. Same thing as the
Lyric. There is a set of 19 AKG speakers
in this car. And then they actually did
make a pretty big deal about them
supporting Dolby Atmos. I don't think
they sound that good. Uh that's just one
of my weaknesses of the tech inside the
car. You can see the AKG logo over there
and on a bunch of the other speakers
that surround the cabin. So that's kind
of an odd weakness. Um, one more thing
I'll go and show you guys the back seat
because yes, it is smaller than the L,
but it's really not dramatically worse
as far as legroom, especially if you've
never been in one of those full-size L
before. So, behind a 63 driving position
and that huge soft comfortable headrest,
uh, I actually do have a good amount of
foot room and leg room. I have a little
bit less headroom. My head is actually
touching this ceiling trim piece here.
And I'm 6'3, so I think a lot of people
might have to experience that. This is a
a panoramic glass sunroof. It doesn't
open or close, but it is nice. And there
is, of course, still a whole bunch more
speakers and blue trim and the same USBC
ports as the L, plus your three levels
of heating, which is cool. Oh, and a
regular outlet and more storage. Great.
You know, you could probably make the
argument that just because it is smaller
than the Lyric, it is actually probably
better for most people in most places. A
lot of urban environments, a lot of city
drivers are going to like that it's
smaller. Um, and then you get to driving
the thing and fully unremarkable driving
experience. It is tuned for luxury over
sportiness. There is a sport mode. Um,
but aside from the 300 horsepower
number, there isn't much sporty about
driving the Optic at all. Nice soft,
relatively floaty suspension, really
really indirect like steering feel. The
steering wheel is huge and soft and
steering is really light and yeah, you
don't you don't feel like you're driving
anything sporty. It actually lacks a lot
of the zip that I feel like some of
those other simpler EVs have, like an
Ionic or a Tesla or even the EX30, uh,
are going to feel much sportier and have
much more acceleration than this, which
I thought was interesting. But yeah, in
general, you know, it gets to 300 mi of
range. It does point A to point B very,
very well. As far as commuting, it's
it's going to be a luxury feel. It's
going to match that luxury feel. The
drive is soft and chill. And that's
that's all you can ask for. But again,
it's all this this is this is what
you're paying for and this is the feel
that people are after when you pick
something like this over like I keep
going back to the the Chevy Equinox or
the Chevy Blazer. That's its main
advantage is this luxury feel. I like
this heated steering wheel. I like a lot
of things about just sitting here in
this comfortable seat and having all
this room and this floating shelf and
this crystal volume knob and all this
stuff. That's that's what the Cadillac
experience is all about. That's why the
Lyric was underrated and that's why this
is also pretty great. Now, it is uh
actually pretty similar in price to the
L. So, here's my asterisk on top of all
of that. The L rides better and does
have more storage space. So, in a world
where like the Tesla Model 3 and Model S
were a few thousand apart, I would say
get the Model S every time. It's just a
better vehicle. With this particular
vehicle, it is a few grand cheaper than
the Lyric. And so, because it's damn
because it's smaller, it's probably
better. It's probably better for more
people. But if you can get a Lyric, if
you have the space for a Lyric, a Lyric
is not that much more, and you could
probably just get that and be very happy
as well. The Lyric is great. But yeah,
there it is. Lyric Junior, the little
brother. It's actually really good for
the money and feels feels luxury, which
is what it's all about. Let me know what
you think, though. Would you pick this
or would you pick something stark and
clean like the EX30 and just have a
little more fun driving? Let me know in
a comment. Thanks for watching. Catch
you in the next one. Peace."

to the autofocus channel because you
want to see autofocus style videos. You
didn't come here for quirks and
features. If you wanted that, you would
watch Doug Demiro's videos. But the
second I first saw this car and started
testing it, immediately my brain just
went straight to, oh, this is this is
quirky. This has a lot of quirks and
weird features. So, I'm going to do a
little bit of a mix of both because this
is the Mini Countryman. It's electric.
It's weird. I I just reviewed I think
the Volvo EX30 might have been the last
video on this channel, which was this
very clean Scandinavian design, very
minimal, and I liked it a lot. This is
kind of like the opposite thing in the
same segment. Small crossover, but a ton
of weird, interesting things going on
with it that you might actually like.
So, let's get into it. So, first of all,
the basics. This is not a Mini Cooper.
This is kind of a a big Mini, if that
makes sense. It's a Countryman. It's a
It's a literal crossover SUV at this
point. So, it has the same like shape
and proportions as those tiny minis, but
it's not as tiny. It's two rows, four
doors, and it's in the same segment as
the Volvo. It's starting around
$41,000. Spec up, you can get it closer
to $50,000. And for that, you get a lot
of, like I said, interesting features
and quirks. And I mean I I've driven it
for the past couple days and really
enjoyed some of them. Some of them are
just character for the sake of
character. It's funny like they don't
serve any purpose, but they are still
interesting. And I think people who
drive minis and like minis enjoy that
type of thing. There's certain things
that Minis do, which you'll see in a
second, that are just they feel at home.
It gets roughly 260 to 280 mi of range
depending on which spec you get, which
is not bad. 150 kW charging, which is
also pretty middle of the range. And uh
sitting on these 18-in wheels. The minis
always have small wheels cuz they're
small because it's a mini. But yeah,
18-in wheels with allseason tires, and
that's what we're working with. It's
funny. As much as I like the color red,
I typically don't love like an all red
car, but they do a good job of breaking
it up here with all the black trim and
these little details on the fender. And
then the white mirrors and white roof at
the top and this little cutout panel in
the back that says all four because this
is the all four spec with dual motors
and all-wheel drive. But now it's, you
know, it's got silver wheels. It's not
all red. It's kind of broken up a little
bit, which is nice. And then these front
DRLs, which are these big boxy colors,
and then the headlight in the middle,
look pretty cool. The little S is
yellow. It's actually not a bad looking
vehicle. Now, before I get to some of
the crazy quirks and features, I will
point out this is where you charge at
the back left corner. And this whole
vehicle is is a platform that they share
with the gas vehicles, meaning you can
get this exact same Mini Countryman as a
gas car. Uh, but this is the electric
version. So, there's your AC and DC CCS
charging port. At the back here, you got
this nice little overhang, which kind of
feels like a little bit of a sporty
spoiler. And then these tail lights,
which you can actually customize the
LEDs in. Great red reflective paint. But
yeah, you can you can change what those
LEDs do when they light up, which is
kind of cool. I'll show you that on the
inside. And then, of course, just to
show that the Countryman actually has
space. There it is. There's your real
trunk and a little bit of a sub trunk,
always where you'll find your charging
cables. But that's not bad. I mean, this
is really uh a reasonable size vehicle
for more than just groceries or golf
clubs. This is probably going to have
kids in the back and all kinds of extra
stuff, which is a good opportunity to
show you the back seat space because
it's not bad. I mean, I've been in a
Mini Cooper before and it's nothing like
this. This is, I
think, a little more manageable. Now,
there's a little bit of a cutout down
underneath the seat with lights there to
be more comfortable if I want to stick
my foot under there for road trips. You
also have your vents here and USB
type-C, but this column here is still
here from the gas car. I don't think you
need that space to be I mean, the middle
seat's not going to be great with that
column right there. Uh, but two in the
back should be totally fine. These
headrests, which can flip up, you flip
them down to see out the back because
it's pretty shallow. But in general,
pretty comfy back here. nice sunroof
which can open. It's not bad. It's not
bad. But I want to show you all the
quirks and features of owning and
driving this car. And that's all up
front. Oh, also I don't think this door
opens wide enough. I just want a little
bit of a bigger opening, but that's uh
that's nitpicking. Okay, front seat.
Here's where it becomes a
mini. You see what I'm talking about?
So, everywhere you look in here, things
are just a little bit different. And
that's quirky a lot of things. I mean,
I'm just going to start with what's
right in front of you, which is the
steering wheel, which is uh it's got
this little belt band in the middle,
which that's that's certainly unusual, a
little bit quirky and different. Uh and
then right behind it, there's this sort
of a pattern. I I don't know why, but
hotel lobby comes to mind when I see
this pattern. Um anyway, there's an HUD,
a whole bunch more interesting, unique
cutouts. Not necessarily sure if they
have a meaning behind them, but they're
definitely different. Vertical door
handles different. And then in here is
the star of the show. This is a
circular dinner plate sized OLED touch
screen. And if you if you've been in a
Mini before, you've seen they have
typically some sort of a circular dash
layout in the middle. But now it's 2025,
it's all digital. and you realize you
don't see circular screens very often
because most UIs are built to be
rectangles or squares. So, you know,
most of the stuff here actually makes
sense, right? So, this is your swiping
through the middle for most of your
major applications. I have Android Auto
connected right now. This is your trip
meter for energy readings. You got a
clock. So, okay, some things make sense
as a circle, but Android Auto is a
square. So, they they put this the
square inside of the circle, and then
they kind of put things around the
outside of the circle, your power level
as you drive, your battery level, your
temperature, which this is all
touchscreen controls. Now, below that is
just a small bank of your physical
controls here. Obviously, all the air
conditioning stuff is on screen, but
down here is another couple quirky
things. This is your start stop. To turn
the car off, you turn it left. To turn
the car back on, you turn it right, kind
of like a key, which is sort of
interesting. And then this is your drive
mode selector. Push that down to go into
drive, down again for driving with
regen, or up for reverse or park. So,
that's that's different. And then over
here on the right, this is your
experience selector. So, I'm going to
change the mode in the car. And uh just
give it a listen. Changing the
experience. Go to go-kart
mode. So, you get a a nice woohoo
because this is the go-kart mode, which
shows you a live geforce meter, your
pound feet of torque, and your
horsepower as you're driving. And these
needles move around. So, okay, this this
is circular. This makes sense. You
although kind of start duplicating
things. This is another power meter and
this is your battery. But that's go-kart
mode. And that's the most responsive,
zippiest version. This all-wheel drive
car will do. I think it's a 5second 0 to
60. It feels quick. It's definitely
quick. Uh but then if you switch your
experiences down to core, that's your
normal drive
mode. Pretty reasonable sound. But then
you can also go down again to green
mode.
which is going to be your most efficient
mode. So now your power meter over here
and total battery over on the other
side. And then of course it's a circle.
So power again, battery again. But yeah,
we're we're making use of the circle
here. Now there's a couple other modes
here as well. There's the vivid mode,
timeless mode, balance mode, trail mode.
Each one of these
modes when you flip it into that mode
has its own sound and its own use of the
circular display. I don't know that if I
was in this car and if I was on a trail
if I would actually flip it to trail
mode just to see my my incline
percentage and the percent, you know,
the number of degrees of side slant and
having a circular compass. Like, is that
actually what I want when I'm on a
trail? Not really. But it is cool that
Mini's built these things in to take
advantage of the circle. And that feels
like a cool quirk. It's a good character
trait. Either way, if you want the rest
of the regular settings, you can jump in
there. You can obviously flip to the
HVAC settings and that's all great. You
can go home. You can go to Android Auto
at any time which will get me copyright
struck immediately. Uh and then you can
make phone calls. Great. Now, of course,
you can't forget the entire center of
this car also is quirky from top to
bottom. So, first of all, you've got a
little slot underneath here where you
can put your phone cuz it's a wireless
charger. You can put one phone there.
There's a little notch if you want to
grab it. That's fine. Or you could put
your phone down here because there's
about one phone's worth of storage in
there. Or you could put it down here
because there's two cup holders. Uh or
you could put it in this little box
right here because there's just a a
little box that says mini. It's got a
latch. It magnetically opens and closes.
You can put your phone in here, too. Or
or you can put it down here because
there's two USB type-C ports. And then
you can do your wired charging in there.
There's no storage inside this this
armrest. that just adjusts forward and
backward. So, that's actually kind of
nice. You can store a larger item maybe
here if you need it. But the box is also
always here. I don't know. That's just I
haven't seen a setup like that before,
but I end up just using this armrest
most of the time and putting my phone on
the wireless charger. Sure. So, then
driving this car, like I said, this is
the all-wheel drive version as you've
seen. So, it is a little bit more uh
peppy and has a little bit less range
than the single motor version, but it is
uh an an okay drive. It is definitely.
So, first thing I like is it is pretty
smooth. It has the 18-in wheels with the
big sidewall. You can go up to like
20-in wheels, which I think it would
also probably be fine on. The suspension
is pretty soft. I do want to give some
feedback on the pedal calibration. There
are two drive modes like you saw.
Basically, there is drive, which has
automatic regen, and the automatically
added regen. When a car pulls in front
of you, it can get pretty strong. I just
I find it difficult to get calibrated to
this automatically changing regen. It's
It goes from coasting to braking without
me doing anything. It's weird. So then
you can drive with regen on all the time
by going to B mode. Liftoff regen is
strong. I just don't love the auto
regen. But the other thing I want to
give feedback on is the brake pedal. The
there's like no braking at the top of
the pedal. like the the first inch or
two of travel of the brake pedal doesn't
do much and then you get on the brakes
and then suddenly you're braking harder.
So, I would have liked a little bit more
of an even brake pedal, maybe a little
bit more bite at the top of the pedal.
But, in general, the rest of that it's
like it's pretty light. It it feels
smooth and planted and uh honestly, no
issues with the rest of driving this
car. You get used to having a square map
on your circular display. You get used
to having the HUD right in front of you
with your speed. I don't know if you can
see this. I'll try to show you. But down
here, it actually mirrors what's
happening on this display by your mode.
It's kind of blinking, but I feel like
you can actually kind of see that. Shout
out to the iPhone 16 Pro's camera. But
yeah, no, it is it is generally actually
roomier than you expect a mini to be,
and it's fun to drive. Also, I want to
show you this. You remember I said you
could customize the tail light design?
Here's how you do that. You go to
exterior lighting and then on the back
here, you actually have to turn the car
off to do this, but you can go Yes.
Goodbye guest. You can hit this button
over here and then there's three
different rear light patterns. That,
that, or that. Classic, favorite, or
John Cooper works. And this, yeah, this
is the actual spec with the white roof
and the red uh paint, which is pretty
cool. But yeah, you can literally change
the way the lights look. So that's
that's cool. I wish I could like dial in
my own tail light uh looks. I can't, but
I can at least choose between the ones
that are in here. So, that's another
quirk. What other What other car are you
out here changing the tail light
patterns on? So, look, as far as choices
to actually buy something in this
category, this is a small electric car
in the $40 to $50,000 range, and it
happens to be a little bit higher off
the ground. It's in the sort of mini
crossover area. And there are others
that are going to be a better deal. I
think a Model 3 is probably a better
deal. And there are others that might
personally appeal to you more. Like for
me personally, I like the Volvo EX30 a
little more. You might like the Kona.
You might like something else. But this
I think many fans are going to love
this. I think this character, this
personality that it has and all the
quirks that it has fit it super well and
the fact that it's able to pull those
off in a quality way and not drive the
price up too high is pretty sweet. So, I
think I think they've got a hit here.
Well done, Mini. I never thought I' I'd
say well done mini, but yeah, good job.
Let me know what you think. Thanks for
watching. Catch you in the next one."

I bet normally on this
channel you'd expect me to take the
hybrid version over the gas powered
version of a car every single time, but
this LC500 right here from Lexus, well,
this is a funny one. See, we have
reviewed the Lexus LC500 hybrid on this
channel, and we weren't really that
impressed. But this this is just a
straight gas version of the same car. It
has a naturally aspirated V8, and it
sounds really good.
Now, a hybrid version of a car is
usually a little bit heavier, but also
adds a little bit of quickness thanks to
the electrical assist. But what's funny
is the V8 version of this car is 100 lb
lighter and is still quicker. 0 to 60.
Now, obviously lighter weight, better
sound. This V8 version is going to be
more playful and fun to drive, but did
you know it also goes further on a full
tank than the hybrid? But then the final
nail in the coffin, this V8 version is
also cheaper than the hybrid. So, uh, I
guess if you're Lexus, then hybrid isn't
always the answer."
2TBWVwTn9WM,You could wait for the Rivian R3X or...,"Volvo is back with another sleeper hit in the form of the EX30.

little unfair to compare cars that don't
actually exist yet, but hear me out.
Ever since Rivian unveiled that R3 and
that R3X, people have been wanting it,
lusting over it. A nice compact
crossover type thing that's sporty,
accelerates fast, has an okay range, but
is going to start at under $50,000.
Like, people want that. I've seen a ton
of people talk about that for the years
since it's come out. but it's not
out. But the funny thing is there is
something that actually accomplishes all
of that exact same stuff today that
people don't talk about much and it's
right in front of me. You're probably
not exactly sure what I'm talking about
right now cuz I haven't seen a ton of
them on the road yet, but it's this.
This is the Volvo EX30. It's a compact,
sporty crossover type of thing. short
wheelbase, nearly the same as the R3X,
and starts at right around
$47,000 like the R3X, but this thing,
this is with today's 2025 tech, and I'm
actually very impressed with it. So, let
me walk you through this. So, I've been
living with this thing for the better
part of the last week. I wasn't actually
really sure what to expect with it. I'd
come from testing Volvo's EX90, which if
you want to watch that video, we'll link
it below. The basic specs on this is
it's dual motor, 422 horsepower. It does
0 to 60 in 3.4 4 seconds. And then it's
small enough to have a 69 kWh battery
and 250 mi of range. And it charges at
153 kW. There are like two trims of this
basically, the base and the ultra trim.
They're not very far apart in price, but
one of them, the Ultra, does have more
tech inside. Now that I've driven it and
lived with it, I really like a lot of
things about it. This exterior look,
which you're looking at with me, I think
it's hot. I love these headlights. I
like a lot of things about the outside.
The inside is very minimal. And then the
driving experience has been great. The
range is definitely its biggest
weakness. I think in 2025 tech, in order
to hit this price point, you have to
have a smaller battery. And so maybe by
the time the R3X comes out, they'll be
able to do this same thing with like a
300 something mile range. That would be
nice. But everything else about this has
been great. Matter of fact, you tell me.
Honestly, in the comments, tell me if
you disagree. I don't think there's
anything not to like about the outside
of the EX30. It's really well
proportioned. Nice short hood that you
can see over the lights and the light
show every time you get in there and
unlock it. Look really good. It doesn't
need a real grill. So, you got this nice
simple logo on the front. Scandinavian
design is pretty clean in general. It's
got these nice little subtle vertical
slats similar to the Ionic if you've
seen that before. Real air vents going
through the side there. You can see a
little bit of tire sticking through.
It's on 19in allseason tires, by the
way. Small trunk. We'll get there. But
you got this like light on the side here
for your blinkers. Regular door handles.
I like the silhouette here of the black
trim at the top and then the color at
the bottom. I usually wouldn't go for
like a bright colored car like this, but
I think it handles it really well with
the black here and the black up there.
Then you get to the back. Nice lights
again as well. I The flickering is not
happening on in real life. It's only on
camera, but nice Volvo logo, EX30 badge
down there. The light show again when it
locks is nice. Rear windshield wiper.
Nice little spoiler. And here's where
you charge. So, overall, pretty
intuitive. Really nice looking outside.
I I just doesn't have any bad angles.
So, then to hit this price point with a
compact crossover in 2025, they had to
do a good amount of minimizing in the
interior. So, this is a very minimal
interior, kind of similar to what you
might see in a Rivian R3X or even a
Tesla Model Y at this point, but it is
built really well, and it does have some
nice quirks that actually make it
functional, especially in the center.
So, let's go ahead and sit down. Oh, by
the way, the X30 badge right there
hidden when you close the door. But,
this is what it's like to sit in the
driver's seat. So, this steering wheel's
got a nice little flat top and a little
flat bottom. Not a huge fan of the
buttons, but pretty reasonable, minimal
setup. And then you have this single
vertical screen in the center. That's
where all your information is. There is
no screen back here. Your speed is up
top. Your visualization is up top. And
uh 12 1/2 in of real estate for
everything else you're doing with this
car. So, foot on the brake and putting
into drive fires it up. And you do have
Google Maps built in, but you also have
the ability to do CarPlay if you want.
So, I was sticking with the Google Maps
that's built in. It doesn't have Ways
built in, though. So, if you wanted to
add that Play Store, jump in there, sign
in with your Google account, you can get
ways, Spotify, all that other good
stuff. Uh, so you don't feel like you
need to attach your phone, but if you
want to, you can. But then, yeah, super
minimal. No physical buttons here. No
physical buttons here. All of your
climate controls are here, although you
can move the vents physically. Uh but
all the climate controls are with the
screen. Uh you have a heated steering
wheel, heated seats, and then let me
talk through this center console. So
this doesn't open, which is the first
kind of interesting thing about the
center console. But this floating
storage right here has adjustable uh
organization. So if you want it to be
cup holders, you can make it cup
holders. If you want it to not be cup
holders, you can do that. Then you have
this second area down here, a wireless
charger for a phone, but you can drop
two phones in there. And then this
little tray in the middle actually opens
up for a subtree storage with two more
USB type-C ports. I've never seen that.
It's magnetically closed, so it's really
satisfying to open and close. That's
interesting. And the glove box to this
car is also in the middle. So, there's
there's no storage over here. No
buttons, just your air vents and a
center glove box. So, in general, really
minimal. Here's your door handle. It's a
little high, but that's nice. Oh, and
the window switches are in the middle,
too. So, if you want to switch to
controlling the rear windows, you hit
that, it lights up. I've never loved
this. I wish they had two sets of
switches, but you do control the window
switches just like that. I should
mention single pane glass here, but it's
been totally fine and it is quite quiet
when you close
them. And the Harman Cardon sound
system. So, you wouldn't expect the
Harman Cardon sound system to be that
good. But in a car this price that
doesn't have the Bars and Wilkins, they
somehow still have pretty good sound.
So, what I'm getting out of that is
Volvo knows how to do a good sound
system in all of their cars, no matter
what. Apparently, there's a lot of nice
minimal materials in this car. These
seats are cloth seats, but they do have
a good amount of adjustments. The
adjustment little panels right there.
And you do lumbar support. You do tilt.
You can move all sorts of stuff. Extend
the thigh support if you want to. That's
a weird camera angle. I won't do that
again. Um, but there's a little flag
right there. There's a little accent
stitching right there. There are
recycled materials around here, as well
as your typical rubber and and plastic
stuff that you're used to seeing. I like
the minimal bezels on the mirrors and
you do also have a little light when
someone's in your blind spot. So, you're
not missing too much. It's just it it
very much feels appropriate for a
minimal interior. Uh, and if you've
driven a Volvo or a Polestar before,
you've seen this stuff before and it's
not too intimidating. I think some
people might be turned off just like in
Teslas by only having your speed on that
screen, but yeah, I'm used to it. But
I'll show you the back seat as well
since we're talking about materials and
in general how it feels to be inside.
The glass roof thing helps, but it is
not the biggest back seat. So, I am now
behind 63 driving position and I close
that rear and right away uh I'm not
trying to put my feet or my knees behind
this this seat right here. So, you'll
want a shorter person in front of you or
in the back. This is what it's like to
have a compact vehicle with a small
wheelbase. This is something like
a 160 165 inch length, which is close to
what the Rivian R3 is going to be, where
like a Tesla Model Y, for example, is I
think closer to like 185. So, you have a
lot more rear space and a little more
trunk in something that's more full
size, if you want to use that term. So,
it's a little crowded back here, but you
still have this big glass roof. You
still feel like you're taken care of,
and I think I could put two people back
here comfortably. Three if you're really
stretching it. But you also do have a
trunk. So, let me show you
that. All
buttons, all touchscreen buttons. So,
there's your small trunk. Groceries fit
there. Golf clubs fit there. Little bit
of sub trunk for some cables and stuff
if you want to hide some stuff. But,
yeah, regular size trunk. So, in
general, as far as compact crossover
type things go, this is pretty standard.
I just think when you talk about the
minimal design and the interior and the
and the sort of unique things they've
done with materials while still being
well built, it's got its own character
to it. Um, obviously the color is going
to do a lot of lifting there, too. So,
okay, then what's it like to drive the
EX30? Well, I'll tell you this was my
next most surprising thing about this
this vehicle is Oh, wow. It's got some
zip. I didn't expect it to be this fun
to drive. Now, I told you the horsepower
figure earlier. It's dual motor. It's
all-wheel drive. It's 422 horsepower. If
you put me in this car and made me guess
how much horsepower it had, I would have
been very wrong. I would not have
guessed 400. I would have guessed 600
horsepower. It feels way quicker uh than
the number suggests. So, it's got a ton
of zip in a straight line. It does the 3
and 1/2 second 0 to 60, which is crazy.
And then being as compact as it is, it
handles pretty well. It is actually
decently light. That doesn't feel right
to say. It's still 4,000 lb, but it's
4,100 lb, uh, which in the world of
electric cars, um, is 1,000 lb lighter
than some other EVs. And so, yeah, it
does actually feel nimble and steers
pretty well even on these allseason
tires. I have some minor complaints
about driving. If I wanted to give some
real feedback for Volvo on this vehicle,
one, the one pedal driving that you have
calibrated in this car is worse than the
EX90. It's a lot worse, actually. I know
the EX90 has multiple modes. This EX301
pedal drive, when I let off the
accelerator, it still coasts quite far.
And I'd want it to be a little bit more
aggressive with regen or at least give
me the option to be more aggressive with
regen. And then when it does stop, it
has this kind of herkyjerky stop where
I'd want it to be a softer limo stop. So
calibrating the pedals and the one pedal
drive would be nice. But then from
there, I think the suspension is really
good. It is not firm at all, but it is
very communicative. So it's very
forgiving and can be fun to drive in a
sporty way. So this is it's still really
good. I just wish the pedal calibration
was better. Oh, and then the one other
thing that annoyed me was this little
thing right here, which you're looking
at, which you've seen in a lot of other
cars. It's staring at the driver
constantly, and it's basically trying to
make sure you're attentive and have eyes
on the road. And if it ever sees that
you're looking away or looking down at
like your phone or or something like
that, a little warning pops up on this
top screen that says, ""Hey, pay
attention to the road."" This is like
super sensitive. I would literally check
my rearview mirror for a second and then
get a a ding warning saying, ""Hey, pay
attention to the road."" I would check my
blind spot for a second and then get a
ding saying, ""Hey, pay attention to the
road."" It was a little uh a little too
excessive. I turned off driver alert. It
turns back on every time you drive. I
also turned off There was one other
thing I turn Oh, it has a
lanekeeping assistance which I turned
off in driving settings at the bottom
here. uh lane keeping aid. I turned it
off. You get back in the car the next
time you want to drive. It's turned back
on by default. So, these are little
things that I just wish were calibrated
better since you have them automatically
turn on every time you drive. But other
than that, I feel like those are pretty
minor nitpicks and also things that
could theoretically be fixed with
software updates in a world where the
rest of this car, the interior, the
material choices, the comfortable seats,
and all the things that are built well.
Everything about this car I generally
tend to like. I'll show you one last
thing, which is the extremely comically
small uh front trunk. Now, of course,
it's still a little small crossover, so
I'm not expecting the most storage, but
sometimes I wonder when they put these
front trunks in if they actually expect
people to ever use it. Yep. Wait for
it.
That That's That's the front trunk.
That's uh literally a dozen eggs or
maybe your takeout if you really don't
want to just put it in the seat next to
you. I guess that's an option. Uh but
yeah, look, I I like a lot of things
about this car. Clearly really like
driving it. Would never road trip it
because it doesn't have enough range,
but it is plenty fun enough to be a
commuter. Has plenty of range to be a
daily driver. And I just I think people
who are waiting for R3 and
R3X can take a look at this because it
does all that same stuff in 2025. And I
don't know when R3X is coming cuz the
R3X is also more like oh it can off-road
or it can be like a trail driver type of
thing. And this can do trails but it
also I believe has a spec that's
specifically for more off-roading and
trailing if you want to check that out
too. But yeah, as far as daily driving,
bro, Volvo Volvo seems to be on my nice
list this year. Shout out to the EX90
review. If you haven't already seen that
video, check it out. It's like
Rolls-Royce level luxury. Um, but as far
as daily drivers, EX30 surprisingly good
as long as you don't need to carry
anyone tall or any large things in the
back seat. Let me know what you think.
Thanks for watching. Catch you in the
next one. Peace."

their EVs for the first time, and I
think they may be making a bit of a
comeback. This is the new CLA 250 trim
they're showing at the auto show. And
there's a couple big reasons to be
optimistic here with this thing. First
of all, the basics, 492 mi of claimed
range from an 85 kWh battery. That would
be incredibly efficient. They're also
going up from a 400vt architecture to
800, and it'll charge at up to 320 kW
now, up from 200. And there's also
allegedly a native NACS port, so you
don't need adapters to charge a Tesla
superchargers. But then they've also
reorganized the electronics to make
enough room for a front trunk for the
first time. And it looks like a pretty
decent sized one, too. Along with this
interior refresh that looks pretty
solid. Plus, they're doing all new
software to replace their aging MBUX.
I'd say that is a lot of updates to
bring them up to speed. Also, there is
an ice spice version of this car, and
I'm I'm not sure what to do with that"

a vehicle sometimes means a lot. Like
whether it's heritage or something
performance related. And so if you see
an M badge on the back of a BMW, you
kind of know what that means already.
Like you see AMG on a Mercedes, we get
what that stands for. Chevy's had a
badge for a little while, too. Uh it's
the SS badge. And if you're familiar,
you might remember the Camaro SS. Sod
sport, but this is the newest member of
the SS family. Hey, this is the Chevy
Blazer EV SS. It's a performance
version, and I think it's worth
rebranding the SS. The SS should stand
for sensible sport. And that's really
easy for me to say cuz I've been living
with this Blazer EV SS for the past
couple days now, commuting with it,
driving in it, and I am I'm so impressed
by the combination of sportiness and
practicality. But just as a headlining
feature, I think this is the thing that
really got me as far as sensible sport.
what this really is. This is basically
the cheapest way to get 600 horsepower
new EV with 300 miles of range. That by
itself is worth a headline. Cheapest 600
horsepower, 300 mi of range. And we've
seen so many of these performance
versions of EVs nuke their range to
achieve the better performance figures.
Like remember the EV6 GT having 200 mi
of range? Remember how many of those
we've seen? This might be the cheapest
new 600 horsepower car, period, for the
fact that it retails at right around
$62,000 starting price. This spec that
I'm testing here is $64,000. So, for
that money, like we said, dual motor,
all-wheel drive, 615 horsepower, and 650
lb feet of torque, 102 kWh battery, and
it'll charge at 190 kW peak charging.
Now, I haven't actually reviewed the
base Chevy Blazer EV yet on this
channel, so I'm just going straight to
the SS. But the things that you should
know that are different about the SS
aside for more power is one, the larger
six piston brakes up front, and two,
there is an entirely independent
suspension tuned just for this car. So,
new brakes, new suspension, more power,
and still with 300 mi of range. Now,
aside from that, the Blazer EV is going
to look like the Blazer EV that we've
seen before. I like this front bar.
You've probably seen some of those on
the road if you've seen a Blazer EV, but
also there's an SS badge about the
front. You go around to the side.
Actually, I'll I'll get to the charge
port in a second cuz I think it's pretty
crazy. But then around the back, you
have those rear lights again and your SS
badge. Sorry, my hand just keeps
blocking autofocus. SS all-wheel drive.
So, that's the back of the Blazer EV.
And yeah, let's let's just get to it.
This is the charge port up here. And the
way you open it is just by pressing
right around those two dots. It opens
this whole flap down here. And for some
of you, this might actually be a little
bit familiar because you remember the
Cadillac L. The Lyric, also a GM
product, also had this big crazy charge
port opener. And that's what reminded me
to check the Lyric V numbers, and they
actually look identical basically to the
performance of this car. The Lyric V
costs a lot more and it's obviously
going to be more luxurious, but as far
as performance and power that you get in
a straight line, this is basically a
Lyric V. Anyway, shout out to the
habanero red color as well. This is a
very bright red that is showing up and I
think the Oppo Find X8 Ultra is
capturing it pretty well. But in
general, I think it's a pretty good
looking SUV. Wow, it's windy. Good
looking SUV, good looking crossover,
whatever you want to call it. Nice
little accent colors. There are real air
vents that are channeling air through
and obviously a whole lot of black trim.
So, I'm a fan of that. Generally, a
decent looking car. The sensible sport
theme continues when you pop open that
rear tailgate because it is
automatically opening, which is nice.
And then there's, of course, a good
amount of trunk space here. And when you
pop this open, there's actually some
extra storage. It's kind of narrow, but
if if you do have like small things that
can fit down here, then you can put it
there. Also, charging cables if you want
to move those. So, you have a little bit
of sub trunk space and then a big
regular trunk. And then you have
manually folded rear seats. So the
second row folds down and can make a
nice little flat ramp. I'd say that's
pretty practical. But let me show you
the front seat now because there's a
bunch of fun stuff on the interior of
the Blazer EV SS as well. Unlock it.
Regular door handles here. You get into
the driver's seat and right away you're
greeted
by that fun chime that Chevys always
make. a bunch of SS branding and then
these huge screens which are in of
course the regular Blazer EV and then
you turn around and you're like, whoa,
we got a whole bunch of colors here
because this interior is full of it.
We've got gray, we've got that orange,
and then we've got the light gray and
then a whole bunch more contrast in the
back. So, that's your fun SS branding.
It's continued through the back seats,
too. And it's nicely illuminated with
this massive sunroof. I like this
interior a lot. I think it perfectly
matches the sensible sport theme because
it is spacious and comfortable. There's
a lot of other swords that I guess I
could be using, but yeah, spacious is
one of them. Uh soft, comfortable, and
there's a lot of good practical storage
in here. So, wow, there actually is a
lot of swords. Uh there's some storage
down there, two USBC ports, there's a
single wireless charger for a smartphone
here, two cup holders, and then a nice
good spot for your NACS adapter because
of course it still uses an adapter to
plug into NACS. Uh you can see all this
detail in the seats, which are very
comfortable. And I mentioned the Lyric V
earlier because of the similar
drivetrain and the similar performance
numbers. The interior of the Chevy is
not as premium, not as much leather,
much more cloth and much more plastic,
but I actually don't mind it. Plenty of
physical controls where you want them.
You still have really intuitive like fan
control buttons and basic stuff there.
Obviously, don't want to max that out.
Please go back down in fan speed. Um,
but you got the volume knob up here. You
have the back of the steering wheel
buttons for your volume here and next
track back there. You've got the extra
regen button. Steering wheel is a little
bit bigger than I would like, but in a
big comfortable vehicle like this with
the lights on top and the little sensors
back here for your self-driving, all of
this is very familiar. Oh, and there's a
HUD up there if you can't already see
that. See if it can focus. Yeah, there
you go. Oppo. But I like Chevy software
and this big H. This is like a I think
it's a 17in diagonal display here with
the integrated volume knob which does a
lot of stuff. It has the Google software
built in, meaning you can jump in the
Play Store and download a bunch of apps.
You can watch videos while you're
parked. All the entertainment works
really smoothly. And then, of course,
you have Ways and Spotify built in. So,
I actually don't feel the need to attach
Android Auto or Apple CarPlay because my
phone is paired and I can do Bluetooth
audio for calls, but if I want to do
Ways, I have Ways built in. So, I don't
need CarPlay to do that. So, there's a
lot of good stuff here and it's smooth
and it works well. Performance is
awesome. Oh, and if you ever jump into
the drive modes, this is where you'll
see sport mode. And if you want to max
out and get your full 615
horsepower, wide openen watts mode is
how you'll do that. And it'll stay on
for the entire duration of your drive.
It's not like some limited 10-second
thing like some performance cars. You
can just leave it on. It'll chew through
your range faster, but that is your
maximum power in this car. So, I love
just the creature comforts and the
software experience and the general
usability of the controls and just
sitting here in this car. It's it's
nice. It's a comfortable place to be.
Now, on the road, the main thing you
need to know is it's really quick in a
straight line. That's the party trick.
It does it. It's got the horsepower and
it can pull that off with all-wheel
drive every single time. I know they say
they developed a special suspension for
this version of the Blazer. I have not
driven the original Blazer, but I would
say that this one rides very smoothly,
very compliant. It's not stiff. It's not
crashy. It's It's totally soft and fine.
It's not floaty. Um, but it's fine. It's
not It's not punishing at all. It does
have like the the one EV party trick
that you expect out of any of the big
tall, you know, EV6 shaped Rivian shaped
things like this can hang with anything
else in its price class, which is
amazing. And that's that's why you get
the SS version, Sensible Sport. Also,
speaking of sensible, let me show you
the back seat because I can get behind a
63 driving position, no problem in these
back seats. And you can see how much
extra leg room I have. That's good. I
mean, I'm totally fine in a road trip
situation here. These are heated rear
seats with power with movable controls.
I mean, I like it back here. This is
this is ex this is great practicality.
So, the SS badge here kind of speaks for
itself. I would challenge you to find
another brand new car, especially an
electric one with 600 horsepower and 300
mi of range for
$62,000. I don't think there is one. And
so, if that's what you're into, I mean,
I don't blame you for being into it.
This is definitely a car that pulls it
off. I think it looks pretty good. I
think it's very comfortable. It has the
space. It doesn't sacrifice the range.
Can't really fault it for anything. I
mean, there are other things you can get
for 60 grand that are gas cars, but
Chevy, well done on this EV. Hopefully,
it doesn't make Cadillac too mad. Thanks
for watching. Catch you guys in the next
one. Peace."

Second of all though, it's a

right? Nope. One of the weirdest things
though, this gear
selector is sequential. Meaning if I go

That has to go through neutral again to
get to reverse every time. That's crazy."

And then the five is a upcoming sedan
again, and then the six is a concept
coupe. But if there's one thing that's
clear, it's the Polestar one. Uh is the
one that started it
all. The Polestar one. The Polestar 1
definitely came first. And it is a
hybrid
uh hybrid sports car. And it's one of
the most unique cars of all time. And
I'm not exaggerating. Like if they say
that your car says a lot about you,
well, god, this thing says a lot about
its owner. This is one of the more
interesting cars I've gotten to test.
And I think as we go from the front to
the back, you'll be a little bit
surprised by how many choices they've
made. Like I said, I like the Polestar 3
a lot. And the Polestar 4 is pretty
nice. So I was like, okay, I'm going to
see where this all came from, where the
DNA originated from. There are some
similarities to this, but a lot is
really different. So let's just let's
start with the basics. So okay,
performanceoriented hybrid sports car.
We've seen that description before,
right? But immediately when you get into
the details, every single choice they
made sounds like they were trying to do
something that would either confuse you
or be like something no one else would
do. So the engine up at the front here
is a turbocharged and supercharged
inline 4. So dual forced induction
setup. And there are also electric
motors. The engine only powers the front
wheels and the electric motors and
battery only power the back.
Okay, that's already really interesting.
Uh, the total is something like 619
horsepower, 738 pound- feet of torque.
That's good for 0 to 60 in 3.7 seconds.
It is very quick, uh, especially
considering it's 5,000 lb curb weight,
but yeah, it does have a pretty big
battery inside. It's a 34 kWh battery,
and so the thing can go electric only,
rearwheel drive, about 50 mi if you want
to. But already just this this
powertrain setup, it's pretty unique. So
then the aesthetics, obviously a matte
gold car like this is again pretty
unique, but there's a lot of other
things going for it, too. I really like
the look of this car, to be honest. Big
21in wheels at the front and the back. I
like black wheels, too, so that's pretty
sweet. Pulsar also, they always do this
thing where they've got the text on the
front and the side of the car. If you
look up close, like it's just a sticker,
but I kind of like the look from far
away enough of the text on the side of
the car. So, they continue to do that.
And then here's the front, which I think
it's a good looking car. Big matte gold
logo up here. A real vent here since
there's an engine unlike the other
Polestars. And then there's carbon fiber
trim all the way around this car. Like
we said, it's a performanceoriented car.
Nice looking headlights. I like the look
of this car from the front. Bigger hood
than normal, but obviously no front
trunk in there. You get to the side, you
got the flush door handles, two sets of
seats, even though there's one door.
We'll get to that in a second, too. But
then at the back, that is your gas tank,
which you can open from inside the car.
And that is your charge port, which you
can open whenever you want because it's
a plug-in hybrid. This is the back of
the car. Good looking lights, I think.
Again, you can see kind of like the
Volvo DNA, but that's the back of the
Polestar. A little bit of active arrow
there with that spoiler. matte gold
logo, tail pipes, real tail pipes, and
again, even more carbon fiber just to
keep the weight from being 5,500 lb. I
guess they've even match these little
caps here in gold. It's not the exact
same color gold as the rest of the car,
but I can appreciate that. Optimized
carbonfiber
body. Carbon fiber body. This thing has
a 34 kilowatt hour battery, an engine,
three electric motors, and a carbon
fiber body, and weighs 5,000 pounds. I
This is already getting fun, but I got
the key in my pocket, so all I got to do
is press that button right there, and
that's how you get in. Nice big door,
gold seat belts, gold stitching, leather
seats. Let's get inside, cuz it gets
even more interesting once you're in the
Polestar.
So, whatever you were picturing the
inside of this car to look like, it's
probably a combination of some stuff
that you were expecting and some stuff
that is completely out of left field.
First, I mean, the steering wheel, which
is heated, is pretty nice. It's a normal
looking steering wheel. Uh, this is also
how you start the car. It's this little
little notch here. So, I put my foot on
the brake and you twist this and then
the car lights up. The screens turn on,
everything boots. And it is obviously a
hybrid, so it doesn't have to turn the
engine on right away. And then you've
got all this like carbon fiber trim over
here with metal big handle. Lot of
speakers. So there's the Bowers and
Wilkins system. There's that front
speaker that everybody's very familiar
with. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god. Hopefully
the copyright gods have mercy on this
one. But check it out behind me. You'll
see something again interesting. Rear
seats. Huh. Who would have thought? So
the same way the Porsche 911 has rear
seats. Like I wouldn't want to put
anybody back there. I'm not even going
to try to get back there. I am trapped
in the back of the Polestar one. There's
currently no way for me to get out. You
see here, you would think this button
would move the seat forward so I have
some way to get out, but it's not doing
anything. And the door handle is so far
up because this is a long boy door
coupe. I can't reach it. Like I can't I
think I'm just stuck back here,
unfortunately. Uh this is where I'll
spend out the rest of my days. Nobody
with legs probably wants to spend more
than a few minutes in the backseat of
this car, but they decided to do 2x two
instead of just a two-seater. Another
interesting choice because when you see
the trunk of this car, you might
reconsider that decision. But okay, the
rest of this layout, pretty standard. I
will definitely highlight that whenever
you see any car that Volvo makes with
the Bowowers and Wilkins speaker setup,
you can pretty much guarantee it's going
to sound amazing. This is like an A
tier, not quite S tier, but a really,
really good speaker system. And there's
lots of big speakers all around this
car, so that doesn't surprise me. And
then you get to the middle and again,
okay, so you got your hazards, you got
some physical controls, and then the
gear selector, another crazy one. I'll
get to that in a second. Uh cup holders,
you can cover your drive mode selector,
and then you can fit one phone in here
if you want, and a spot for the key.
That's about it for the center storage.
The software is not great in this car.
So, luckily, it does support uh CarPlay
and Android Auto, which you'll pretty
much immediately want to start using
because the rest of it is is basically
useless. I mean, you can see the fuel
consumption in this really old school
graph, and you can see the phone
connected. This is just really old
school, outdated. It does get software
updates, but it's it's definitely not a
highlight of this car. you kind of just
go home, go to CarPlay, and never use
that again. So, there's four drive modes
with this car. You hit that drive mode
selector, and you see it's all-wheel
drive, pure electric, hybrid, which is
everyday use, and then power, which is
combining the electric and gas for
sporty driving. And in general, you
know, cuz people will buy this
performanceoriented car and get it for
the way it drives. It's a pretty fun,
surprisingly fun car to drive. Again,
it's 5,000 lb, so you're you're probably
a little bit surprised by how uh quick
it
accelerates. Um, but it does accelerate
quickly. The brakes are really good. It
does have balance, and it rides decently
well. It's not too stiff. It does have
adjustable suspension, kind of like
you've seen in those BST Polestars,
which are awesome. So, it is a sporty
drive. Nothing about the sound invokes
any emotion at all. this dual forced
induction setup. I guess it shouldn't be
a surprise. Like, it's powerful, but
there's no emotion to shifting gears.
Absolutely none. You have paddle
shifters there, and you might as well
not think about what gear you're in at
all. Just let let the automatic handle
it. But I did want to mention this this
gear selector real quick. Um, I don't
think I've seen this in any other
somewhat modern car. Typically, you can
see this right here. You would go
forward for reverse or down for drive.
Right now we are in park. I'm going to
put my foot on the brake and go down. I
am in neutral. Now I have to go down
again to get to drive. It's a little
thing, but it's sequential. So if I want
to go to reverse, you would think just
go up
once. It goes to neutral and then goes
to reverse again. It's such a subtle
thing, but you can't just go straight to
reverse. You have to go bop bop to go to
reverse and then bop bop to go to drive.
It's just another weird thing about this
car. So, while we're at it, let me show
you two more weird things. So, over
here, you can adjust your mirrors. You
can adjust your windows, but also
there's this little button right here.
This allows you to put that little
spoiler, that active arrow up or down.
So, I'm going to put the spoiler up and
show you what that looks like. I'm also
going to turn the car off because you
have to do that manually. And I'll come
out
here and it's closed. You can't park it
with the spoiler up. So, I got to get
back in the car and show it to you with
the car on. So, foot on the brake, start
the engine, hit the up
button, and there you've got your little
spoiler. Kind of looks like a little
baby Lexus spoiler if you ask me. And
then you got see a little bit of the
electronics underneath it. That's what
it looks like up if you want that
spoiler up. That's all you get. And then
the one more unique thing I got to show
you is the trunk because like I said,
this is a 2x two setup, right? So
there's a whole bunch of space right
there for your rear passengers. And so
you get to the back and super unique,
really cool setup where you can see a
lot of the electronics connecting with
these orange cables, but then that's the
whole trunk. So, that's, you know, maybe
enough room for some groceries.
Definitely not going to fit golf clubs
in there. You could fit maybe one and a
half suitcases or some duffel bags for a
road trip. Uh, you've got your charging
cables right here. And then you also, of
course, always have enough room
for the sponsor of this video, Denvix.
So, this is their second generation Moto
X tire inflator. Everyone should carry a
tire inflator in their car just in case
they ever need it. If you don't have a
compressor built into your car, this is
one of those things that's a lifesaver.
So, I carry one all the time. And of
course, you're going to want to opt for
one that's really quick and actually
easy to use. And this new Moto X can
inflate a standard car tire from 0 to 36
PSI in just 45 minutes. So, it's just as
fast as some of the other larger
inflators out there, which is awesome.
You've also got a 15,000 mAh battery
capacity, which means you can inflate
six to seven tires on a single charge.
And because of that capacity, this thing
also doubles as a power bank. So, let me
just show you here. USB ports, USBC and
USBA. Fast charge stuff in an emergency.
That's super useful. So, why not have
one of these in your car? I think this
is also 65 watts, two-way fast charging
compared to the 45 watts of the last
generation. And it's also TUV certified,
so it's handy if you need to charge up
like a MacBook or something. And then
lastly, if you're at the side of the
road at night, you've got this light at
the bottom, multi-function light, so you
can have it bright, you can have it
blinking, you can have a red or yellow
flashing for emergencies to put it on
the side of the road while you're
changing that tire. Super useful. So, if
you want to check this thing out, you
can get 30 bucks off if you buy it from
Denvix's website, or you can get it off
Amazon. Check it out at the link in the
description. And thanks again to Denvix
for sponsoring this video. But yeah,
again, another baffling choice. If you
wanted space, you pick a different one
because this one's going to go small
trunk, large rear seats. Also, there's
some more speakers. Those things sound
amazing. Uh so in general, this has a
highlight of being actually technically
one of the most uh efficient
performanceoriented cars I've driven.
You get great mileage. You can actually
go 40, 50, 60 mi on EV only, which is
nice. And I do think it has the
aesthetic highlight. This is a really
good looking car in my opinion. But from
there, yeah, basically every single
thing they've chosen to do is is
curious. It's like they wanted to do
something no one else would do. Now,
some of that may appeal to you. Some of
that may be uh why you like this car
over other cars, but I should tell you
it's also
$160,000. So, for all that money, you
could get a lot more car. If you just
want a great track car, you could get a
Corvette C8 Z06, you could get a 911.
You could get a lot of car. If you just
want a great street car, you could get
an M8 Competition for that money. You
can get a Model S Plaid and a Model 3
Performance. Like, there is a lot of car
you could get for this money. So, if
you're going to opt for this, you got to
know what you're getting yourself into,
and you got to really want that
uniqueness, which, like I said, some
people will want that. I do think the
backwards powertrain is just a little
bit weird with the engine powering the
front and the electric motors at the
back. I feel like they would switch that
and that would be better in every
performance way. But nonetheless, this
is what they've made. One of the most
unique 600 lb or 600 horsepower cars in
the world. Uh shout out to the geese for
being extremely chill this video and not
threatening me at all. They definitely
didn't threaten me once while I made
this video. Okay, thanks for watching.
Catch you in the next one."

You'll notice it's built entirely to be
off-road all the time. You'll also
notice there's no doors over here on the
side. That's because you get in the
front like
[Applause]
this. Now, once you actually get to the
interior, it is, I think, pretty simple.
There's just a whole bunch of buttons
and switches, but nothing is in the
normal traditional spot. There's no
steering wheel up here. Instead, there's
these two levers, which just break each
side independently. So to turn right,
you break the right side wheels, and to
turn left, you break the left side
wheels. So this is how you get into the
back, which actually has about seven
seats right now. You can get it with
more or less, but the typical buyer
might use it for storage. Sometimes it's
first responders, sometimes it's a fire
department or a movie set. This vehicle
also has no suspension, but that's okay
because it uses airing up and down the
tires really quickly using exhaust gas.
But actually, I think the number one
reason you won't see these on the road
is because they're not street legal. But
but that's fine."

on this Volvo and I'll tell you why I've
reviewed a lot of really luxurious cars
on this channel and you know what they
say about like the Bentley's and the
rolls-royces of the world they're not
actually a good value but if you truly
want the maximum luxury the 101% luxury
then that's where you got to go to get
it and it's going to be like3
$400,000 but how do you get as close to
that as possible without spending that
kind of money what does that actually
look like and I have a new answer to
that question this is my actual new
answer this is a Volvo ex90 and I'm
telling you guys this thing is like
98% of the luxury of that car quarter of
the cost so I'll disclaimer this by
saying I've never actually driven a
Rolls-Royce cinin which is probably
closer to the size of this but I did
review and drive for a week the
Rolls-Royce Spectre which by all
accounts and by everyone else who I've
seen review that car that is like Peak
rollsroyce the quietest the smoothest
the most soft and plush that's that's a
PEX right this now that I've driven it
for a week is so close in so many areas
that were special about the Rolls-Royce
so I'm going to go through that and
explain why I think we're probably
sleeping on this car but first just the
basics this is a three row SUV from
Volvo and it starts in the 80s I think
it's 80 something thousand this one is
somewhere in the '90s it's got this sort
of beige sand color twin motor roughly
100 KW hour battery and this is a pretty
highly optioned one that'll get you
about 300 Mi of range on a full charge
now Volvo just kind of refreshed their
entire lineup here so this is brand new
I actually a long time ago for Top Gear
reviewed the xc40 recharge which was the
previous like generation of their
electric crossover now they're doing
ex30 and ex90 this is the big one and so
it kind of looks similar different
headlight design still big wheels still
generally the shape of a Volvo if I come
back here you'll immediately recognize
the shape like this this light pattern
that they do very much Volvo this tail
light up here now this one's also the
performance trim which is another option
to get it to be a little bit quicker in
a straight line which is fairly easy for
an EV but generally I think this is a
pretty good looking car as far as big
three row crossovers go pretty standard
sure I'll still give the edge in luxury
that last few per that's going to go to
the rolls rice again that is a slightly
better looking car if you're going to
spend crazy money obviously but this
isn't crazy money this is a regular L
priced expensive car but if you're the
driver here's where the luxury starts
right so if I'm going to get in this
front seat and start thinking about how
much money I spent check out how loud
that
is can't hear a thing I didn't edit that
at all so thing number one is it's
incredibly quiet in this car and you
know what's funny when the the Volvo
reps dropped this off they actually
mentioned to me hey uh this thing's
about as quiet as a rose a spectre
inside I'm just saying and then they
like walked away in my head I was like
yeah right I was in that car I was
sitting next to a garbage truck and
couldn't hear it and now that I'm in
this car and I've driven it and I've
I've played with I mean these windows
are plenty thick and have double glazed
glass and all that they've done an
incredible job probably a 99% job as
good so that's number one is it's super
super quiet in here which brings me very
quickly to number two
which is you look around in a Volvo and
you see this and you see this you see
the Bowers and Wilkins setup the
speakers in this car are absolutely
unreal s tier speakers in this car it
helps a lot that it's quiet in here also
but man this is a top five speaker
system I've ever heard in a car it's one
of those that you listen to your music
you listen to whatever you're listening
to you get to your destination you throw
it in park and you just sit here for
another 2 or 3 minutes just listening to
the rest of that song or the rest of
that album cuz it sounds that good you
start to hear things that you've never
heard on any other speaker system it's
really good but then the third major
thing about these Ultra Luxury
experiences is definitely just material
choices and sitting in this interior
okay yeah I'll still give the edge for
sure to Rolls-Royce in that category
that's where they really shine they have
these crazy next level like super plush
floor carpets and like the seats are
incredibly soft and comfortable and way
more metal and physical controls the my
back same thing okay totally get it this
is a more modern and clean take on a
luxury interior that I personally like a
lot I mean you have the big screen in
the center and the second screen behind
the steering wheel but then the rest of
it I think is laid out really nicely
there's a lot of room so you got storage
down there you can sort of hold
something up against this if you want to
USB type-c ports this is your key card
which you put right here to drive unless
you want to Wireless charge your phone
two cup holders a nice little glassy
volume slider and also a play pause
button and some more storage space in
there so this is nice then you also have
some leather over here obviously the
speakers I I think though if you want to
consider you can't forget this the seat
just sitting down when you sit down in
the car what's the most important thing
for materials it's how the actual seat
feels and these
seats are really good they're super
comfortable they're like again 99% of
the Rolls-Royce seat maybe not visually
but they're super soft they're heated
they're ventilated they've got this
extension rest for your thighs there if
you want that this up here is a speaker
uh they're just the right softness just
the right amount of support and
bolstering this is a great great seat
now it may be time for one more hot take
so I'll just give it to you I don't
think I've ever experienced a good
massage from a car seat lots of people
like to say oh yeah it's got massaging
seats cool I'm not going to use that but
if you want to this car also has them
it's got this little adjustment down
here you tap that button you go over to
massage and you can set up a super
intense high-speed seawave massage
pattern and it's a 20-minute pattern and
then it starts doing things it's fine I
almost never actually care about that
but you have it in this car the software
experience though better than a
Rolls-Royce I'm just going to say that
right off the bat Wireless carplay is
great I've got my phone connected but
also you can just use the Google
experience you can go Google Maps you
can do almost anything you'd normally
want to do here and it is smooth good
job with the software Volvo if you've
seen Volvo's cars and pul stars before
you know this is good I am still a
little bummed or at least a little uh I
think people will be bummed that most of
these things are on the screen instead
of real buttons like the HVAC controls
could have been like a nice luxurious
set of real buttons down here but
instead you got to go here and bump that
up or down and like it's a nice super
well heated set of seats and the
steering wheel is great but I would have
liked to set a buttons for that but okay
it's it's not quite the maximum luxury
so I guess that gets a pass but let's
get to the second row though because
there are more things that you need to
see in this three row SUV oh that rhymed
okay second row is very spacious I get
in here as a 63 person behind a 63
driving position and uh let's do another
sound test
demo it's so quiet uh but yeah plenty of
leg room here they kind of have these
cutouts behind the seat but I think all
three people in this second row can be
adults and be totally fine and this also
gives you a nice view of this enormous
sunroof above our heads very very nice
tinted sunroof um I'm you get the vents
you get the speakers you get the uh
controls down here this is a nice second
row experience the third row which I'm
not going to get in in this video but
I'll show it to you is similar to the
rivan r1s it's it's two seats back there
I wouldn't put adults back there for
very long there's not a lot of leg room
kids can be back there for sure there's
cup holders there's USBC ports there's
more speakers there's more vents so
they're not like getting crushed back
there but yeah there's a second row but
you can always fold that down and make
more trunk space if you want these are
just such good materials though I I
really think the comfort thing is
underrated it might not look exactly the
same it might not feel exactly the same
but for a fraction of the cost of that
car they're shockingly comparable very
similar so Volvo if I could offer any
feedback it's not perfect there are some
things that I've already mentioned I
would rather have seen physical controls
for H back um this is I'll say one of
the best implementations of carplay I've
ever seen where I can pull up ways here
and it will put the ways directions up
here and allow me to continue doing
other things on the screen so that's
good this though I don't know why they
keep doing this they have this single
switch oh sorry I got to put my foot on
the brake and start the car single set
of switches for the windows up front
which will put the front windows up or
down but if I want to change the back
windows I have to hit this button and
then I'm controlling the back windows
just put just put four sets of window
switches here it's not that expensive to
have extra switches I feel like that was
inspired by Tesla and they didn't have
to do that and then driving this car the
last thing that is really important to
the luxury experience and you've heard
people talk about the rolls Ro
suspension before is it's super floaty
the goal is to be completely
disassociated with the road I don't want
to feel a single pothole it's funny like
sports cars are like I run over a coin
and I can tell if it's heads or tails
but in a Rolls-Royce Spectre I run over
a a trash can and I barely notice it and
that's the whole point of of the luxury
of this car is you're just kind of
cruising along this suspension is very
very similar it's super good really good
adjustable air suspension it rides
smooth on tons of horrible roads I was
super impressed by that the one pedal
driving though I felt could be
calibrated a little bit better so there
is the option while you're driving to
turn on uh obviously all-wheel
performance is going to be great if you
turn that off it's just going to be
front-wheel drive and a little slower
but one pedal drive is either on off or
Auto I turned it on because I wanted to
do regen all the time when I take my
foot off the accelerator putting your
foot back down on the accelerator was a
little bit soft for the first part of
the the travel of the pedal I wish it
was more direct I wish that calibration
was better closer to what Tesla or
rivian does so that's a subtle complaint
but in general yeah if you're curious
the car also rides super well so I'll
leave you with this when you think about
getting a large luxury crossover like
this and you want it to have you know
all the basics all the fundamentals good
space good comfortable seats good range
and then you just want it to be as
luxurious as possible I think this one
actually
nailed all of those fundamentals as well
as they Poss could the sound isolation
the comfort of the seats the softness of
the suspension the incredible speakers
like those four pillars are awesome in
this car I also feel like uh I haven't
even mentioned this but this little lar
Suite up top here it's not activated yet
uh so the self-driving and cruise
control features don't use it yet and I
wonder if they'll get better when that's
activated but in general I'm not too
worried about it I think this car is
great so shout out to Volvo the ex90
surprised me and how good it is and
maybe now that this video is out we
won't be sleeping on them so much thanks
for watching catch you in the next one
peace"

of college. Um I remember this cuz all
the upper classmen had cars. All the
younger kids didn't. And the way it
worked was I played ultimate frisbee.
And if you're on the team, every time we
go to a tournament, we'd all pack up in
one of the upper classman's cars and go
for a road trip. And when all the
seniors graduated, we lost all their
cars. And so, we needed some people to
get new cars. So, when I got up to being
a junior, I needed to get a car that was
decently comfortable, could fit a bunch
of people, and had decent enough gas
mileage. And so, I ended up with this, a
used red Toyota Camry XLE. This is a
2014. These are the actual pictures I
took of that thing the day I bought it.
So, now to this day, whenever I see a
red Camry from around this year, I think
of mine. And I averaged 37 12 mp gallon
lifetime with that thing. It was sick.
And I remember that because I played the
little efficiency graphic in the screen
in the front of the car like a video
game. Like I wanted to max my high
score. Like if I got downhill enough for
a long enough drive, I could get into
the 40s. 40 m per gallon. It was crazy
back then. That was my idea of fun as a
college student. Anyway, this this is
the newest Toyota Camry. And so I
figured I'd sort of take a look back at
my first ever daily driver and how far
it's come in the last decade because
Toyota, as you know, has been sort of,
some might say, stubbornly focusing on
hybrids instead of doing electric cars.
And I mean, you might have seen my
previous video. It's kind of what they
do. They are getting really, really good
at hybrids. And so, let's take a look at
how far this Camry has come in the last
decade, cuz it's basically a whole new
car. Now, when you see a Camry on the
road, the proportions of the thing have
not changed that much. Like, the general
shape and size is very much still Camry.
I'll talk about some of the extra trim
bits on this one in a second. But
inside, you're looking at a 2 1/2 L
naturally aspirated inline 4 cylinder.
And uh there's actually three electric
motors. There's two at the front and one
at the rear. So, it can actually drive
all-wheel drive on electric power only.
And when you combine that gas and
electric, it's 232 combined horsepower.
That's not actually that little. That's
surprisingly peppy. I'll talk about
that, too. It's a 1 kWh battery and it's
rated for 44 m per gallon highway. So,
on a full tank, that's something like
550 mi. The Camry's main goal is
definitely still to be the economical
option and starting at $28,000, it very
much is still firmly planted there. But
what's funny is you can definitely still
option up a Camry maybe higher than you
expect. If you were to guess how high
you can spec a brand new Camry, you
might be a little low. Similar to
specking an iPhone 16e up to the max
storage and paying $900 for it. I don't
recommend this, but you can spend
$50,000 on a brand new Camry. I think
this XSSE trim starts at like 35 grand
or something like that. So, don't do
that. But at the base price, starting
lower, economical option still. Now, I'm
going to be totally honest. I think the
new Camry looks really good. Similar to
how this bird up here looks way better
than your average Seagull. This car
looks way better than your average older
Camry. It's got this nice grill up front
here. Kind of blocks out some of the
sides, but then has a little second
arrow feature. I like that. That's a
reflector. There's your headlights.
Similar to the Prius's look. I think
it's nice. You come along to the side
here. It's obviously the gray color and
you kind of see the red seats. So,
that's kind of cheating, but nice wheel
design. You flow down the sides, you've
got some nice shapes and then the black
roof color. So, this trim bit here kind
of gives the car a bit of a sleeker
lower look if you ask me. And then XSSE
trim. Okay, you've got this little baby
spoiler thing. They don't want to
actually put a real spoiler on it
because you still need this car to slip
through the air and be very efficient.
But, you know, black contrast that kind
of looks nice. And then look down here.
Look, dual tail pipes. Not bad. Lots of
nice lines on this car. Dare I say even
sporty a little bit. Look, look at that
diffuser down at the bottom. And this
black trim. It's not the point,
obviously. But here, let's get into the
practicality features cuz if you hold
down that trunk, it will automatically
open up all the way. And yes, it's a
Camry. So, it's got a nice fullsize
trunk
and nice spare. So, you're never going
to be out in the cold without that.
Obviously, the trunk is important for a
Camry. And this would absolutely still
qualify if I was trying to get a car
like this today because look at this
interior. This is going to remind you a
little bit of the Prius, but a lot of
Toyota cars all look pretty similar in
this way. Now, this is a bright red
leather interior, and I kind of I I like
it a lot. It looks sick. The car that I
had had a tan cloth interior, which was
also totally fine. A little harder to
clean, but it lasted. to do the job. But
you can option up a Camry with this like
nice red leather and this these accent
pieces and the speakers integrated and
more speakers down here. And even though
there's a lot of plastic, it does
actually feel a bit more premium if
you're into that. But then, yeah, all
the other things that you know and love
about a Camry, well, they're all still
here. It kind of feels like I've
optioned up a mid-range phone to cost
$1,000 where I've gotten a whole bunch
of extra features brought down from the
world of premium devices, but I also
kind of still have the bones of the
economy option. So, you do have a
wireless charger here. It fits like the
biggest phones, so that's great. You got
some storage there, two cup holders,
plenty of storage in the middle. Love to
see that. And you've got all the drive
modes right here. This is basically all
you really play with when it comes to
driving the Camry. obviously your gear
selector, but EV only mode if you want
that. Brake hold you can turn on and
then switch between eco, normal, and
sport. Now, if you're a gamer like me
and you're trying to get the max uh
efficiency score, there you go. Eco
score. You basically can read this as
you're driving, your startup, your
cruise, and your stopping are all
factors that affect how good your
mileage will be. So, as you start up,
you start up and you accelerate really
smoothly and nicely. That'll be good.
you'll mostly use the electric power and
if you go above a certain power
threshold then the the gas motor kicks
in. You can play with that and you can
get to really really good skill levels
at getting the maximum mileage. Similar
to the Prius, again I think Toyota's
software here is really good. Uh you can
obviously pair your phone, but then you
have all these physical controls here
which do a good job. So your seat
cooling or heating but not at the same
time. Temperature up and down fairly
intuitive. Fan speed up and down. You
hear the uh gas motor kick in when I do
that. And then you have your power down
here. So, two USBC ports and one USBA
port. Look, you got even like these
metal pedals and you have this big
sunroof. Like, there are there are a lot
of premium features. Heated steering
wheel. Premium features in this car
despite it still being the economy car
option. Here's one of my favorite newer
features my old car didn't have. A lot
of EVs nowadays, when you let off the
accelerator and you start to regen or
slow down, the brake lights turn on.
Even though you're not putting your foot
on the brake, you've let off the
accelerator and started to slow down.
So, the brake lights will turn on and
light up to know the car behind you can
see that. Similarly, they all have
screens that show the car in them. So, a
lot of them will light up the brake
lights on the little car on the screen
in front of you. This one doesn't have a
little screen showing the car. But if I
go ahead and hit that brake pedal here,
boom. You see these little red lights
here? That's how you'll know your brake
lights are on. So, anytime you slow down
with enough regen or hit the brake
pedal, you'll see the red lights turn on
and you'll know that your brake lights
are on. So, in case you were wondering
if the brake lights were actually on,
you'll always be able to tell. Now, one
more thing that's way better about this
new Camry than the old one, uh, the
cameras are way better, which shouldn't
be a surprise for 2025, but they are.
Now, if I hit that camera view button,
it starts doing this like weird 360
animation thing. I'm not sure why it
plays that every time, but if I just put
the car in reverse, hits up that rear
camera and an overhead top down 360
view. You can see everything here. You
can correct for distortion or show the
ultrawide version. You can show
different lane markings or turn them off
completely. This is great. I'm I am
definitely guilty of being one of those
people that can only park um with
cameras. So, I was very happy to have
the cameras back then and they're even
better now. Okay, let's check out the
back seat because if you are going to be
transporting people, you want to at
least have a decent enough legroom.
Maybe if you're transporting ultimate
frisbee athletes or college kids that
are somewhat tall, you'd care about
this. So, for the back here for a road
trip, honestly, very acceptable. I've
been in the backseat of my own car many
times, and this feels very similar. The
fact that everything is bright red, I'm
also definitely liking that. Um, but you
also have this this glass up here, which
this uh I believe, yeah, you can motor
this open or closed, which is nice. Some
nice storage here, your vents here, no
screens needed, and some power with
USBA or USBC. The shape of the Camry
means the the sloping roof line kind of
cuts in a little bit. And they have
these cutouts over each seat to give you
a little bit more headroom, but if
you're tall like me, you could find, or
at least if you have a lot of hair like
me, you could find that you are up
against the ceiling. Honestly, not a
horrible amount of headroom, but
something to keep in mind. I think I
would have still been very tempted by
this car if this exact type of spec
existed back in 2014. Now, driving the
car itself, obviously, you're not buying
this as a performance car. It's not a
sports car, but I will note that a
highlight of it is one, it rides very
well. It's very comfortable. The
suspension is tuned to just be a
cruiser, and it's a lot peppier than I
remember, which must mean it is is
quicker. 232 horsepower is not going to
blow anyone's mind, but because of the
electric drivetrain and the hybrid
system, Toyota's got this tuned where if
you move that pedal down a little bit,
you can sort of zip up and into spots
and out of spots very, very easily. It's
got some pep to its step, which is
exciting. I did not expect that of this
car, but it pulls that off really well.
So, it's comfortable, suspension rides
well, and it's got some pep. So, look, I
I get why Toyota continues to do the
hybrid thing because number one, they've
gotten really really good at it. Number
two, they've also kind of committed to
it. Like, they do make that one EV that
I reviewed that's not very good. Um, but
they've kind of got this whole range of
cars now at a bunch of different price
points where they can offer you
something that's going to make sense and
economical and get you a ton of miles
per gallon, and that's what everybody
wants. So, I'm a fan of this new Camry.
I I love that there's new sensors
everywhere and there's new, you know,
adaptive driving features and a lane
keep assist and stuff like that. As
someone who went on a ton of road trips,
I would have loved to have had that in
my car back then, but it's 2025, so now
someone else in my position will love
that, too. And uh I think it looks
pretty good. Maybe I'm biased because
I've liked Camry in the past, but well
done Toyota. Keep making good cars like
this. All right, thanks for watching.
Catch you in the next one. Peace."

really simple I've talked about it
before the the types of cars that are
best to go electric are the ones where
it would be the best version ever being
electric means the car is going to be
bigger and it's going to have more power
and it'll be swifter than ever before
and so how about a muscle car right the
Dodge Charger Daytona is perfect to go
electric it's enormous it's got a ton of
power you want it to go fast in a
straight line it's going to be big and
heavy anyway so perfect but the
execution on this look I can tell it was
supposed to be fun but it didn't
actually end up being that good of a car
which is kind of a bummer you'll see why
this is also the first time I've come
out to a car that's already on and
making noise uh
because I think you can tell why anyway
let's start with the basics so you've
seen a Dodge Charger before right pretty
of the vehicle this is just the electric
one so massive two-door but four-seater
uh Coupe but very much feels like a
sedan we'll get to that in a second but
they've offered this for a while but the
electric one means 100 KW battery at the
bottom dual motor all-wheel drive 335
horsepower at each axle and it's rated
for 241 M of range we'll also get to
that in a second uh but that means
there's a front trunk as well there's
that big rear trunk and that also means
it starts at around
$60,000 uh the Scat Pack version will be
around $70
$75,000 and then this maxed out max
power optioned up version is over
$85,000 and I just can't emphasize
enough how massive this vehicle is so I
know it's a two-door car but I mean you
can you can tell by the camera angles
and by how much of this parking spot it
takes up it's huge it's bigger than
Tesla Model S it's absolutely massive
and I actually like a lot of the design
elements here you've got this big front
spoiler which I also saw on I think it's
the Pulstar 3 and I like a lot so that's
an aerodynamic element You' got these
big red brakes and drilled brake pads I
think you can see a little bit of that
there um Eagle Sport tires there's your
stage two badge for this very expensive
option with carbon fiber and some more
on the inside and then the trunk you can
tell it's an optioned up Scat Pack
because of the spoiler back here but
then you've got the pretty classic Dodge
Charger rear end but look we can't
ignore the elephant in the room you've
probably seen the headlines at this
point this is that car that makes that
noise this is that world's loudest
electric car uh designed specifically
for the muscle heads that like loud cars
it's supposed to sound like a gas car
and I'll let you be the judge I mean
I've got a mic on we'll try a couple
different things it's definitely as loud
as a charger matter of fact it's 126 DB
the same way the gas charger is 126 DB
but they're doing it through this
massive speaker system on the back end
of the car you can see it says frat
Sonic right there it's got all these
grills down here and down here this is
all called the Frat Sonic chambered
exhaust and look it is loud and it does
imitate a gas car um but God it's it's
an acquired taste so here here's what
happens you get in the car you got the
keys in your pocket and every single
time you start it it'll make a cold
start sound so foot on the brake listen
to
[Music]
this okay so now the car's on and it's
in regular mode and I want to give it a
few revs but it sounds a little bit
different and a little bit stronger in
each mode so this is just regular idling
it's got this sort of hum you can almost
hear the
cylinders uh but hold on it gets better
so this is the drive mode selector down
here and if you switch to more
aggressive Drive modes you can actually
rev it so right now in auto mode which
you can see it's in auto mode here uh
foot on the accelerator doesn't really
do anything but switch to a more
aggressive mode like sport mode
now it's much louder and then if you go
to track mode it's actually at its
loudest the rumble is way stronger I can
actually I'm not joking I can feel the
car rumbling like there was an engine
behind me it's kind of
crazy it's just as obnoxiously loud as a
gas car it doesn't sound exactly like
the gas car but I'll try to get some
better Clips on the smartphone's
microphone
[Music]
[Music]
that's the party trick that's the thing
that it does if you want to turn heads
if you want the looks if you want the
respect and the admiration of people who
like loud cars you have some of that
here um but once we get past that the
rest of the car you have to look at too
and here's the thing okay I get that
it's supposed to be fun it's a muscle
car it's not supposed to be super
practical but there are a couple things
about this car that uh challenge it when
it comes to actually justifying it
especially when you heard that price tag
before this this car I'm testing is
$85,000 okay keep in mind you could get
the gas charger you could get some other
EVS first things first it is essentially
a body that they fit the electric
powertrain into that they also fit a gas
power train into so there are some
quirks about it like this center console
in the middle uh is pretty massive like
a groundup EV wouldn't have this
enormous center console for the
drivetrain uh it has some storage in
there but I feel like that's missing a
little bit also let me show you the
front trunk the front trunk is it's
comically small I honestly would never
use it the fact that you have to pop it
and then lift it up and you get that
amongst all of that I just I mean yeah
you can put a backpack in there
basically maybe some groceries but yeah
I don't think many people are going to
be doing that with this car so it it
doesn't feel like a groundup EV this is
a really cool paint though this is a
nice like blue green with some Flex in
it but then I'm trying to think okay
what are the exact reasons what are the
exact people who would want to get this
car and why would they get it okay
reason number one performance it is the
electric version of the charger after
all but a muscle car has got to have the
power and when you hit that boost button
or you do a launch or you're in track
mode 670 horsepower on all-wheel drive
is no joke it's very quick 0 to 60 in
3.3 seconds this makes it the fastest
charger that you can get quar m is like
11 and 1/2 seconds but for
$86,000 if that's really what you're
after is straight line performance a
Tesla Model 3 Performance kind of smokes
this actually even a Kia ev6 GT beats
this a Tesla Model y performance is on
par with this none of those cost $86,000
matter of fact for 80 grand you could
get a used plaid if that's what you
really want is straight line speed so
maybe that's not the only reason you get
this now I know it's not road trips
right like this is a muscle car it's
built to be muscle carry it's not
efficient at all so I know it's got 100
Kow hour battery in it but have you seen
these tires these These are 305s at the
front and then 325s at the back even
though they're all seasons like this
this is not set up for efficiency uh
it's rated for 241 Mi of range like I
said you want to know something funny I
plugged it in for the first time woke up
in the morning in my garage with 100%
battery and it said
2011 201 miles and then I switched to
sport mode and it said 185 now that was
a very conservative estimate but the
idea here is this car only charges at
183 kilow and it only has a sub 250 Mi
range which you could get 250 but yeah I
know it's not for road trips now here's
another bit of a maybe a hot take but if
you're getting it for the
noise you could actually do better it's
not look it's cool that it's really loud
and I get that they wanted to appeal to
the nice car it's really loud crowd um
but a couple things first of all it
doesn't sound as good as the gas car so
if you just want the noise you'll just
get the gas car second of all uh so it
doesn't it doesn't shft so it it
just has sort of this
linear uh sound it doesn't go up it goes
up and down a little bit as you get more
or less G's but as you're cruising
around it sort of just ends up droning
and it sounds like you're just riding
around in like second gear all the time
up and down Hills Flat streets slowing
down accelerating it's like you're just
staying in second gear
you guys remember the ionic 5n which
also did this imitation sound and did a
lot of things gas cars do you could
paddle shift and and like roll through
gears and I think part of the fun of the
sound of a car is dropping a gear and
like playing with the sound and you
don't really get to play with the sound
in this other than just making it be
loud revving in neutral maybe at a
stoplight it's fun at first but then I
think you pretty quickly get over it and
you you just I just turn it off I ended
up just wanting to turn it off the fun
factor is part of it but here's another
fun fact actually it's a not so fun fact
the charger which is kind of known for
like that standing burnout rear wheel
drive crazy Tire smoke show you want to
put on at a stoplight for you insane
people who do that this car is not
actually capable of that it does have a
drift mode you can can turn off the
front motor and go rear wheeel drive but
it's too heavy 5,900 lb and not powerful
enough 335 lbs at the rear axle to do a
standing burnout at all so yeah this the
fun factor is just still you you still
Crown the gas car the king of that part
so here's what it ended up being good at
I drove this thing for a week I commuted
in it every day and that's what it's
good at it's just a comfortable Cruiser
look at this enormous door okay I know
it's a it's a four-seater but this one
huge door is their thing you get in and
you're surrounded by a a pretty plush
interior like it's actually well made
it's got Alcantara up here it's got
leather on the steering wheel these big
seats are really comfortable the back
seats have a lot of room and are
comfortable too you start it
up okay you do the whole cold start
noise thing but whether you have the the
noise on or off off this is suddenly
like a really really spacious really
roomy comfortable Cruiser the suspension
it rides nice in sport mode in regular
mode it's soft it's it's very uh
forgiving in a way that a lot of sports
cars are not and then there's just this
massive visibility these big doors and
windows you've got a glass sunroof
you've got a ton of storage that rear
hatch it's actually a hatchback so you
have a ton of trunk space too and so
this ends up just being a nice car to
it's sounds crazy but just go get
groceries in go pick up the kids in go
to commute every day a few miles it's
not a ton of range but you can commute
in this thing it's got Wireless carplay
gun on here I've got a wireless charger
for my phone right here that actually
sits in place and lines up I'm not in
love with these haptic buttons but
they're functional they work I can turn
the fan speed up or down pretty easily I
kind of know what I'm getting into here
the back of the paddle shifters like in
a lot of these Dodge cars I have a
volume control back here and next track
and previous track back here the power
shot to boost power for a little bit but
honestly I don't I don't feel a need to
do that in this car it's not one of
those cars that that begs to go faster
or begs to be pushed performance-wise
it's very much a large electric
comfortable Cruiser there's even a
pretty good isolation to the outside
world with this double pane glass you
got these LED lights it's carbon fiber
these lights are really nice and light
up at night you can see them really
really clearly this speakers are not
that good unfortunately but I think
everything else about this as just a
daily calm
relaxed boat of a ride are uh are legit
so I know that's maybe not the
conclusion you expect people to get to
with this car also fun uh weird Quirk
about it is because this is such a big
door and the pillar is way back here the
reach for the seat belt is kind of
diabolical but you'll get there um but I
know that's not the conclusion I think
most people are going to get to with the
new electric Dodge Chargers is that it's
nice comfortable relaxed Cruiser cuz
it's supposed to be fun and I get that
this was supposed to be fun the noise
the muscle the looks the shoulders it's
just it's supposed to be this badass
sporty thing but you turn the sound off
and it's actually a kind of just a boat
it was supposed to be fun but uh if you
want a
boat there you go all right that's been

have to get comfortable uh switching my
life around these different things like
with smartphones one day I'm using a
folding phone the next day I'm using a
flip phone and the next day I'm using a
flagship and then a budget phone and
I've just gotten used to switching it's
comfortable same thing with cars one day
I'm driving a pickup truck the next day
I'm driving a tiny electric car with no
trunk and I've just gotten comfortable
with switching and moving my entire life
into a new vehicle to really feel what
it's like to live with it but in between
those review devices is the daily driver
and now I'm going to review my daily
driver so this is the car that I go back
to in between testing all the different
cars that you get to see on the
autofocus Channel and uh you might have
seen the video that I did about it about
a year ago when I first got it in my
belief this is the best car in the world
I I literally believe it's the best car
in the world and I'm super lucky to be
able to drive what I believe is the best
car out there but now you know it's been
15,000 mil and I've had maintenance and
I've had the ups and the downs and this
it's not perfect believe it or not and
so we'll get to all of that in a second
but just for the basics let's just go
let's just recap what this is this is a
992 generation 911 Turbo S 2024 model
jet black metallic yes it's dirty I'm
not even going to apologize for that
this is New Jersey in the winter every
car that I live with ends up looking
like this after not that long there's
salt on the roads and everything but hey
when you drive a car it ends up looking
like you drove the car so it's got some
carbon fiber bits on it it does have the
arrow kit the wheels are powder coated
black the brakes are painted red but
there's a little bit of carbon fiber
here a little bit of Carbon Trim there
and a little more Arrow back here uh if
you want all the full spec details you
can watch that original video uh I kind
of love how it's turned out it's mine
there's a a little bit of a stripe on
the front if you want a little bit of
custom contrast between matte and glossy
but that's about it it's a rear engine
gas powered sports car now the last
thing I want to do is bore you with like
specs and things that you could get from
other videos on this car already so
here's how I want to approach this is
when I first got this car and I was I
had my order placed and I was all giddy
and ready waiting for it I've watched
basically every video not basically I
watched every video on the internet that
existed of this car and the last
generation and a bunch of other cars in
its price class but basically everything
I could watch and just like my first
video ever once I got it and started
using it there are some things that I
learned that I I didn't find in those
other videos some things that I actually
was surprised by so I'm going to do
those things so first of all how many
miles per gallon do you think this gas
car gets go ahead you can place your
guesses in the comment section below uh
so like any other car it depends on how
you drive obviously the City versus
highway mileage but basically it's
Landing somewhere between the teens and
the mid 20s miles per gallon and that
actually means that with its 165 gallon
gas tank I essentially get the exact
same range as the Tesla Model S plaid
that I came from that on a full charge
versus this on a full tank 300 to 330 Mi
obviously this is going to road trip way
better cuz gas car fills up in a minute
or two but that's a fun fact that I
didn't know uh it's also right now
running on uh winter tires because those
do way better in the winter colder
temperatures here so these are P0
Winters they're a little bit less sticky
and get a little bit better range than
the Pilot Sport 4S's I have on it when
it's hot out but there's your first fun
fact but now my second fun fact is the
size of this car is Kind of Perfect it's
a combination of the fact that all right
I don't I'm not telling them to do this
every time I record they just
do chill the combination of being a rear
engine car instead of Mid Engine and
being you know a big but small car at
the same time it's it's a really
fascinating balance so first of all
storage wise you do have a large front
trunk let me pop that um oh actually I'm
going to close that because there is a
fun feature and I'm just going to get
salt all over my hands to show you this
uh if you want to unlock it you just
swipe just like that that unlocks the
front trunk but that's a pretty decent
sized front trunk I'll put the cube
cubic l or whatever measurement helps
you visualize that here but that's two
duffel bags that's a fullsize carry-on
and then some and a backpack on top it's
good I've got my uh my air compressor
over there in case I ever need it
hopefully I don't knock wood um but
that's really really nice to have
because then when I'm traveling I can
put stuff in there and when I get in the
car there's also a whole bunch more
stuff right behind this front seat so
pop this forward and technically okay
yeah those are back seats but that's not
real leg room so I don't want to put
people back there so if you have so much
stuff that you filled up the front trunk
you can then go ahead and put more bags
and storage right there behind you and
the engine is yet even further behind so
yes there is plenty of storage for a
sports car and a lot of people who've
driven 911s of the past would say this
is a big 911 totally agreed um but then
you get inside and the way it drives is
still very much like a compact car if
you've d a bunch of full-size cars try
this just go ahead and reach out to the
side and see how far you are from
touching the other side of your car and
a lot of cars you're not even close my
arm still bent is touching the other
side of this car it's a compact cabin
but yet somehow has the roomiest
footwell of any car I've driven in this
class your foot can just kind of go way
up into the sill like that which is
awesome I can fully extend my leg that's
not a small thing I'm a 63 person I've
driven a lot of sports cars that do not
not have enough foot room for me to be
comfortable in them and it's just
convenient that the one that I daily
drive I can fit in it so the size of the
car both an interesting pro and con it's
a nice balance number three uh the
maintenance of living with it so I've
had exactly one scheduled maintenance
visit so far one oil change 15,000 mi it
was free it was included um so it's been
pretty great as far as maintenance uh my
EVS I didn't have to do anything which
is even better obviously but uh the oil
changes was basically painf free bring
it in for a day and they do it uh the
other thing is I did have one recall on
this car uh if you've read about the 992
generation Porsches you know that the
center lock wheels had a recap so I got
this nice envelope in the mail and I
opened it up and it said hey stop
driving your car now because the wheels
could fall off and that would be really
bad if they did so I stopped driving the
car and then you know you bring it into
the service center and they ECT them and
they go oh okay yours were not in the
batch that were affected so you can go
ahead and drive your car again kind of
weird technically counts as a recall you
probably didn't see any headlines about
it cuz it's not a headline worthy recall
but that is a thing that happened and
nothing bad happened now before I get
into the car I just want to kind of look
at it one more time cuz it's a really
good looking car um I think you know
you've gotten the right car when you get
out your car and start to walk walk away
and then uh look back real quick at it
and you feel really good about what you
look back at yeah that's me every time
now this next take I'm just going to
preface by saying uh it's a bit more of
a controversial opinion a bit more of a
hot take and that is that this car is
not very digital it's it's missing a
bunch it's a it's closer to the analog
side uh in the world of cars now now
before you go crazy before you go crazy
because there's a lot of sports cars
people watching this going what are you
talking about that's one of the most
technically Advanced sports cars ever
made especially compared to other 911s
it's got rear wheel steer it's got
active Arrow it's got a bunch of
different Drive modes it's got
incredible traction control yeah of
course this is a high-tech car but when
you consider all the other cars you
could get in this price range just the
whole other wide world of cars right uh
a lot of them have way more Creature
Comforts that are very Tech in in their
ways hear me out uh the roof for example
a lot of cars have like a electrochromic
tint or something like that this doesn't
have it it has a a shade that you can
electronically close or open fine not a
big deal an expensive car like this with
a bunch of cameras all over the place
you would think would have a dash cam
built in it does not I actually bought a
dash cam this is a thinkware I forget
the name it's like the X7 something
something I'll put a link below uh but I
had that wired up CU this car does not
have a built-in dash cam um there is no
wireless charger for your phone so it
does have wireless car carplay and
Android auto but down here where you put
your phone there's two USBC ports I had
to buy this little cable right here
actually I think the 92.2 refresh of
this generation car does put a wireless
charger there but this one doesn't have
it so wired charging only um there is
also obviously no full self-driving it
does have some basic uh traffic we
cruise control and Lan keep assist stuff
going on there but not that I'd care
anyway I'm not going to full self-drive
in this car but you get my point the
last big point is this car takes a while
to warm up in the winter when you daily
drive it in the winter you remember that
all the other expensive EVS have a nice
app that you can just click and just
warm them up in your garage or wherever
you are this car doesn't have that the
Porsche does have an app where you can
find the car's GPS location and see
basic stuff like your last Tire
temperature or tire pressures or your
last trip length or whatever it's basic
Stu but yeah not a lot of that sort of
creature Comfort Tech when owning this
car but that's not why you buy this car
you buy this car to drive
[Music]
it I love driving and I love driving
this car a lot I'm not going to give you
the Top Gear I do write for top gear but
I'm not going to give you the Top Gear
breakdown of driving Dynamics on a track
what I will tell you is this is kind of
the ultimate street car setup and that
makes it the ultimate Road Tripper and
I've done lots of road trips in this car
so I pretty recently have done actually
every year I do this road trip that is
uh it's actually Ultimate Frisbee
related it's a New York to Boston to
Montreal and back so on a Saturday
morning we'll head out from New York to
Boston that's a nice four or five hour
drive and then we'll play a game and
then the next day we'll drive from
Boston all the way up to Montreal Canada
we'll play a game there and then Sunday
night after the game we drive from
Montreal all the way back to New York
home and I would not rather do that in
any other car but this one it's just
sick it's great so here's the little
dial right so there's a couple different
personalities the normal mode in this
car which is honestly it's not my
favorite I don't really drive it in
normal mode very often but if you drive
it in normal mode it's the softest
suspension the softest steering and the
least aggressive uh shifting obviously
the uh the pdk is incredibly smart and
it gets you the best gas mileage so
it'll Cruise in low PM high gear and the
valves are closed so it's quiet and you
can just sort of cruise out of the
neighborhood in normal mode then you hit
this you hear a little bit of a
different tone and now you're in sport
mode sport mode is basically how I think
normal people will drive this car most
of the time on most streets uh the
suspension still pretty light but with
pdcc ped Dynamic chassis control you can
switch it to a sportier stiffer
suspension the anti-roll bars get a
little more firm everything is a little
bit more responsive and the car kind of
shrinks around you uh at least that's
the way it feels um but now obviously
revs will go higher gas mileage won't be
as good but this is the sort of natural
version of the car and then there is
also Sport Plus um which extends the
front spoiler so there is a little bit
of active arrow on this car it Also
Rises up the rear spoiler and gives you
the most aggressive version of pdk I
kind of would even want it to be a
little bit more aggressive but again
it's great on the street and then there
is also if you want to count this as
Tech there's a wet mode and wet mode
which there's a funny thing there is
actually microphones in the wheel wells
of the car so when it detects and hears
that you're driving on a wet Road by all
the water spinning up into the wheel
well it'll tell you to turn on wet mode
and that will give you the least
aggressive version of pdk with the least
torque so there's no slip the wing comes
up you have the most traction and that's
wet mode when it's raining so yeah this
car is is fairly technically Advanced
when it comes to driving features but
you know like like you said you don't
really get it to focus on the tech too
much you just grab that steering wheel
and and drive it and when you do there's
not a whole lot else like it it's a
great car at everything handles well I'm
not going to even bore you with that I
got this car thinking it would be great
at that cuz I watched all the other
videos they're right it's great I do
talk about a lot of other cars and this
setup in the middle here which is some
combination of buttons and Screen I
think Porsche did a pretty good job I do
hate the piano black gloss in every
single car and I hate it here too I just
wish this could be you know Carbon Fiber
something not fingerprint but other than
that like
these really satisfying switches uh you
can see the bezels here on the screen
but at night this looks like it might as
well be OLED like this all looks really
high quality and then you have these
switches up here obviously your traction
control your
hazards nice uh you have your exhaust
open or close those valves and you also
have a the ability to rise up that front
axle front axle lift is an option it
basically on every single one of these
cars but other than that you actually
can heat and cool at the same
time kind of feels like it's warm but
also there's a breeze at the same time
it's it's it's
interesting uh but it's it's great
there's also a steering wheel heater if
you didn't know it's this little button
down here you press that and the
steering wheel heat comes on uh pretty
quickly too oh by the way I didn't even
mention the speakers they're really good
especially for a sports car so you don't
even usually think about speakers in a
sports car but there is a base set of I
think they're by Bose maybe the Basse
speakers which I have not heard but
these Burmeister sound great they get
very loud they're very crisp and clear
uh some of the best I've ever heard in a
sports car which is awesome uh what else
is there I mean that's kind of all I'm
really need to talk about right like you
already know what you're getting into
with Porsche build quality excellent
quality of materials topnotch I could
open the sunroof if I want to I almost
never
do man what a place so overall what do I
what do I think so far well I think I'm
going to have this car for a long time
uh and I'm going to drive it for a lot
of miles in that long time
if I had to rate this car I would be
giving it something like a
9.82 out of 10 there's almost nothing I
would change a lot of people say all all
Porsches look alike I actually used to
think that and to be fair they kind of
do to most people um but I've gotten
used to the look I like it a lot I love
the tail light bar I
might I'm curious about the next
generation of Turbo S the 92.2 because
it's going to be a hybrid most likely
and that might solve the tiny bit of
Turbo lag that you feel I mean this is a
twin turbo car this has don't let people
tell you there's no lag there definitely
is lag and you can decide to drive on
Boost if you want to and play with the
paddles but I think the hybrid might do
something fun with this car but in
general that's about it man this car is
awesome it's kind of unfair that a lot
of cars I test have to come right after
or right before I drive this thing but I
wouldn't change a thing all right that's
about it I think let me know in the
comments section what else you want to
know I'll hang out and answer comments
there thanks for watching catch you in
the next one love youall peace"

rivan on this channel and I've been a
launch edition rivan r1t owner for a
couple years now like I I think they're
great I really like those things and so
when I saw that they had announced a Gen
2 refresh of them I was the most curious
because I was like okay I definitely
don't need to just upgrade right away
mine is great but also what do they
change I kind of want to know like the
second generation of everything is the
most interesting and leads you to know
like what direction they're going so
what's new with the second generation of
rivan and would I actually noticed them
as a first gen user because to be honest
the second gen looks very much the same
it looks just like the first gen like
this one right here behind me this is
the second gen rivian r1s and you
wouldn't know it if you weren't looking
for it but I've been living with this
one for a little bit you could see where
we were going with that but uh now I've
put together my list in order of how
noticeable to the daily usage experience
each change is from the second
generation to the original launch
edition rivan so let's jump in so this
here is the second gen r1s you can see
this one's in a nice green color it's
got a black interior it's got these new
Wheels with the range covers over them
uh but it's a trotor Max pack battery I
think this is actually performance-wise
basically the equivalent of what the
launch edition people have which is we
got a quad motor but it's also about 850
horsepower and about a 3 second 0 to 60
so these things are really quick and
really powerful but you know when you
again have a second generation thing
there's going to be a bunch of things
that add up to a pretty big change but
individually you'll notice some of them
are a big difference some of them are
not the biggest difference from first
gen to second gen though is the way it
drives it's the suspension and the
motors so I'm going to just jump in and
talk right about that you know one of
the things a lot of reviewers noticed
and talked about with the original r
ones as they compared it to others and
we're talking about the driving
experience and the suspension it was a
little firm it was a little it was a
little rough it wasn't the best riding
thing ever and they've improved that
dramatically but I think that the number
one place that I notice it is I guess
the best way to describe it is the
difference between the allpurpose mode
and the sport mode I think they've kind
of pushed those modes further apart if
that makes sense so the allpurpose mode
when just driving around regular streets
regular bumpy roads holes speed bumps
and all that it's just a little bit
softer a little bit more plush and more
luxurious which I think a lot of r1s
people will like uh it's a little bit
softer with the suspension rebounding
it's a little bit softer with the
accelerator pedal you slam that thing to
the floor and it will be a slightly more
gradual pickup it's it's still crazy
quick but it's a little softer you know
the regen slowing down to a stop is a
little bit softer it's not as firm of a
Regen so all this stuff and you can
change obviously you know the regen
level you can turn it up and turn it
back down to low but everything in
allpurpose mode is just a little bit
softened sport mode is just a little bit
firmer the acceleration pedal is just a
little bit more responsive a little bit
twitchier the suspension is even more
firm it's actually to the point where
sometimes it's a little bit bouncy like
it's a little harsh a little much for
some regular roads that have regular
bumps and potholes so if you're in sport
mode and you're actually carving up and
taking those twisty roads you'll notice
and appreciate that um but that's it
they've just moved Sport and allpurpose
just a little bit further apart and I
think that's the number one thing I
noticed when driving number two though
is the new Range you know there's a new
wheel and tire package and there's
obviously on the website now you can see
new different motor and battery pack
combos I think this is actually doing a
good amount for the range this 22 in I
think it is Wheel and Tire with the
Scorpion tires on it so my car started
with like 315 to 330 Mi of range at 100%
battery and this one is like 350 I think
on the site it says 370 and I think it's
just a little lower in the in the cold
weather we have here now but I think of
it as like one more day of commuting
without charging like I can go a full
week five full business days of
commuting to and from the studio in this
where I could do four on the r1t the new
cameras does doesn't seem like that big
of a deal but when you use the blinkers
a lot and you park this thing a lot you
start to notice them so basically every
vehicle I mean nowadays you see tons of
cameras all around everything a side
view cameras the rear view cameras uh
but when I actually get inside and use
them they are
dramatically dramatically better on this
new one so let me uh just put that there
so it fires up so if I hit the reverse
right here these cameras are way better
they are like 1080p all the time high
frame rate all the time they look
amazing at night way better dynamic
range and the r1t you know it got this
same software update where in the center
screen there is you know all these cool
graphics and you can see this this new
cartoon style animation which is kind of
neat you can see that windmill slowly
turning it's nice but part of that
software update was when you're driving
and you put that blinker on you get this
feed over here it looks great on this
one and I actually use it in the r1t
from last gen it looks like they were
never really meant to be shown those
feeds they pop up because of the new
software but they look terrible and
they're almost unusable they're dark
they're muddy cloudy terrible looking
videos so much much better cameras on
these new cars next up new doors so I'm
going to turn the blinker off there uh
new door handles and latches all right
so this right here is an electronic door
latch the last gen the rivan r1t and r1s
had these big metal door handles so
they're really satisfying to open now
it's just a push button but what's
interesting now is you actually still
have this manual override so you can
still open the door like that and I
actually kind of I still do that out of
habit but this is how you're supposed to
open the doors now which is just a
little button press that and it'll open
and close and that goes hand in hand
with uh the other thing you notice the
most which is when you get in out of
these cars a lot you open and close the
door a lot and one of the issues with
the last generation was uh opening and
closing the door took a lot of force
took a lot of force like people would i'
I'd pick up people and they'd close the
door behind them and realize that they
didn't fully close it because they had
to really shove the thing closed and so
they've adjusted that it makes a
difference you now can really sort
of put almost no pressure on the door it
should close but they now sound
different and they feel different I
don't I don't know if this actually
picks up on camera but it's more like a
latch sound it's more like a like a like
a thud sound like the G wagon sound
which I guess some people like um but it
doesn't feel as satisfying in my
opinion that's just me okay next on my
list is interior updates I think these
are actually uh made out to be way more
than they are they look cooler and I
think the diversity of materials speaks
to people a lot it's got these nice
floor uh floor mats that are like this
plaid and the back of the seats are a
little updated so this is all nice uh
but very similar seat design very
similar in Comfort leg room doesn't
change I mean they're still great don't
get me wrong I still love these rivian
Interiors obviously you have this this
dark interior with this with the Plaid
with the brown wood with this dry
exposed pores super super nice um not a
massive difference but if you do look in
here you can see a little bit of plaid I
don't think that's going over people
says I think they appreciate that so new
interior materials a little bit
better okay there's also something new
in here that I want to point out
remember we did the podcast with RJ and
I talked about the wireless chargers in
the middle being basically useless these
are the new wireless chargers in the
rivan and there's a little divider in
the middle now and they are still flat
but H they still slide around a lot and
I don't think they're actually still
very good and I I don't want to use them
that much and what I also noticed is
when I put my phone on this wireless
charger I put my iPhone on it it always
seems to pop up um like Apple pay or
like triggers the NFC like there's an
NFC tag in it and I'm not sure if I can
get it to do that again it is of course
working perfectly and charging now
but many many times I would put this
phone on this spot and it would pull up
it would just keep asking to use Apple
pay which I think is odd um there you go
see it's pulling up Apple pay asking to
use face ID to log into my wallet for
some reason my Android phone works fine
uh but then if I drive a little bit
it'll slide around it'll fall off and it
won't it won't really do anything uh for
the phone's battery so unfortunately not
a huge difference I think a lot of the
most successful implementations of
wireless chargers are a little bit
banked a little bit tilted so that the
phone's just sitting in a tilted spot
and doesn't move very much I think the
flat one might be kind of doomed
unfortunately so yeah I still don't use
that now there is one more really
interesting interior feature that I find
I don't really use but it is still cool
because it comes with them which is the
electrochromic roof this whole roof up
here uh can be tinted with a single tap
and so if you know that in the settings
it's just two buttons away you just hit
that and then you hit that button right
there what that does is it tints the
entire roof and if you're parked outside
for a long time or if you're driving
with the sun directly overhead it could
be nice to have a roof that you can
immediately hit a button to tint and
untint make it clear whenever you want
um it's cool I don't press it very often
I don't really do it very often but it's
there which is nice here's one thing I
do still use a lot on the rivian though
the front trunk it's a powered whoops
went away the powered front trunk is
that button right there and it pops open
but it's a little bit smaller so let me
show you that I use the front trunk
basically every time I go grocery
shopping with the rivan and this is the
new front trunk it's a little bit more
organized with some uh some Nets over
here that's actually really well
appreciated there's the uh supercharging
adapter that you get for free sick and
you can see this floor and then you pop
that open and the floor is a little bit
higher so there's some charging
materials your first stayed kit is again
pretty well organized but the floor is
just a little higher drain plug great um
I don't think that that makes a huge
difference I still am happy to use this
front trunk all the time the reason it's
actually slightly smaller is uh because
the heat pump up front is right back
here and the heat pump I was trying to
see if I would notice I was reading
about this like it seems like the heat
pump should make the heating and cooling
especially Heating in the winter uh be a
little bit faster but the old ones were
already so fast so I didn't notice it
being any faster I did just notice it
making a difference in driving
efficiency in the winter so when it is
this cold you get closer to your
advertised range on this in a whole
bunch of winter driving rather than it
just heating up faster so that's why the
heat pump's there but honestly the front
trunk difference is minimal and it's
still very usable and then I think last
but not least up front here there is
technically an aesthetic update I don't
know if you notic it but down here here
at the bottom it's less of that like
light silver and this is more blacked
out and dark I like that and then there
are new lights up here so your
headlights all of the headlight assembly
is still in here but this whole uh oval
no longer Winks when you hit the
blinkers the blinker is down here uh so
it's this little nice animation that you
see play that's really actually the main
way from the outside you can tell on the
street if you're looking at a new gen or
an old gen is when they put their
blinkers on is it the old one for the
new one and then these new headlights
are a little bit better honestly driving
at night I don't feel like I noticed too
much of a performance difference even
with the Matrix stuff but then there's
this uh multi it's sort of a broken up
LED here and these will tell you how
fully charged you are when it's charging
but they can also play other animations
um here I'll play actually maybe the
best one which is hopefully one you
never have to use but you're on the side
of the road you have a flat tire or you
have some reason you need to be on the
side of the road and you hit this here
and then you hit this here and then you
have the roadside lighting which is plan
animation to tell people to go around in
this
direction kind of neat let's see what
that looks like on the outside again
just having LEDs on the back of the car
make that a little bit
more useful it's tough to pick up on
camera in the daytime but it is playing
a little animation yeah please go around
this way so new LED lights occasionally
useful but hey everything else about
this truck is still great I still I mean
there are other like super tiny things
there is new speakers I do not find them
to make much of a difference uh General
nvh improvements quietness of the ride
inside tiny tiny difference but not huge
not gamechanging for me but it's still
the r1s it's still quiet Quick Electric
ton of space of features and uh just a
really enjoyable fun vehicle and this
being roughly the equivalent of the
launch edition but making a ton of those
small improvements on top feels like I
mean I'm I'm not going to buy another
one just to get these new features but
I'm glad I've noticed now what they've
changed but also I think there's one
other new thing that they did which is
they announced a they announced a new
Quad motor with like a,
horsepower y'all hear about that"

century is arguably the legendary
McLaren P1 it's a million dooll hyper
car that really showed us what's
possible with hybrid technology when
optimizing it for performance but that
car is like 10 years old now what we
have here though all the way down there
is the latest interpretation of
McLaren's hybrid platform the McLaren
arura I just said hybrid hybrid platform
the McLaren Ura but it hasn't exactly
received goat status and in fact fact in
the short time that it's been out like 2
and 1/2 years now it's already
depreciate it to nearly half the cost on
the secondhand Market is it the V6 is it
the fact that it doesn't have that much
power compared to its hybrid rivals or
is the McLaren formula just getting
played out well that's what we're here
to find out today also this is going to
be really sketch getting down here I'm
like literally in a mountain right now
all right one sec all right we made it
I'm never doing that again and I
definitely like the bushes out home
better but anyway something that McLaren
is known for is being lightweight and
that's because these cars use carbon
fiber monoco chassis effectively just
like a carbon fiber bathtub that the
engine and the transmission all the
components sit inside of and guess the
weight of this carbon fiber tub 181 lb
so that is less than one Mark has
brownly this entire chassis that you're
entrusting your life with in the event
of an accident weighs less than my
employer crazy but the whole point of a
carbon fiber tub is to be simultaneously
lightweight and very strong at the same
time and now McLaren makes these carbon
tubs in house which allowed them to
improve the structural rigidity and
lightness even further so you'll be good
if anything happens I've heard of some
crazy accidents with these cars and
people have come out with barely a
scratch carbon fiber is a wonderful
material and the two big changes that
they made when redesigning the monoco
chassis is now designing it to now house
both the subwoofer and the battery for
the electric motor whereas previous
McLaren would just have those components
bolted to the outside of the chassis so
you have a more uh uni bodyes design but
when getting to the design of the car I
like it it's kind of like a 570s and a
720s had a baby although both the 570
and 720s will be a bit confused about
how that hybrid DNA snuck in there cuz
neither of those use an electric motor
but regardless it's one of the more
understated McLaren designs I know if
you're familiar with the LT cars those
cars are a lot more aggressive
aesthetically but it's kind of like the
McLaren GT in terms of it being
understated I'm sure you probably forgot
about the McLaren GT's existence until
just now so you're welcome for that but
regardless I like this design I think
it's good I think it's great actually so
your only usable piece of storage space
in the car is the front trunk because
the car is mid-engine so you don't have
any real storage back there and you
surprisingly got more storage in here
than one would expect this is 6 cubic
feet of space which is not only more
than what you have in a comparable
sports car like a Porsche 911 which is I
believe 4.8 cubic feet but this is
double or nearly double what you've got
in a Tesla Model S so this super
compromised superar has more storage
space than one of your favorite sports
cars and one of your favorite EVS so
take that but going around back is where
your power plant lives this is a 3 l V6
and it's the first time that McLaren is
using an engine smaller than 8 cylinders
in a road car in their entire history as
a company as far as I know there might
be some like one of three McLaren that
had a V6 8 years ago or something like
that but regardless this is essentially
the first V6 Mclaren has ever done and I
know some people might hear the word V6
and be turned off but there's actually
some interesting things going on here so
first of all this is an 120° angle V6
I'm going to have like a visual
illustration for you to like kind of get
perspective on what that means but
typically in all the other mclaran sales
use 90° angle hot V setups and so that
120° is substantially wider than what
you not only have in other McLarens but
most other sports cars and supercars and
what that allows you to do is have the
engine sit lower in the chassis so
effectively the top of the engine sits
below the top of the wheels of the car
which is actually insane which then
helps your center of gravity and then
that helps your handling and overall
dynamic balance of the car as well it's
pretty cool stuff something else to note
is that this is a brand new engine from
McLaren this is not just the Ricardo V8
that the other McLaren have with two
cylinders chopped off this is a brand
new architecture and I've been told
there's effectively Zero carryover from
previous McLaren engines which is really
interesting when you consider the fact
that this car has a lot of the same
characteristics and a lot of the same
personality as the V8s and the other
McLaren which I'll show you guys a
little bit later the engine isn't the
only thing that's new though you've now
got a new gearbox which I can show you
because McLaren are so cool you can
literally see the gearbox from the
backside of the car so we've now got an
8-speed dual clutch as opposed to a
seven-speed in the other McLaren and you
now have a 94 horsepower axial flux
electric motor that's sandwiched in the
gearbox and connected to a 7.4 K battery
pack that sits right below your butt
cheeks and gets you about 13 to 14 miles
of real world electric range the gauge
cluster will show you numbers as high as
like 18 miles of EV range but in the
real world it's more like 13 or 14 which
is still pretty solid for a car like
this that's like triple what you've got
in the Corvette eay for example and you
can go into electric mode whenever you
want effectively and so the cool thing
about this motor the e- motor is that it
can spin backwards so this car doesn't
have a traditional reverse gear you're
just using the electric motor that's
spinning backwards and so you might ask
miles how do I go into reverse if the
battery for the electric motor is dead
well you don't if you kill the battery
you effectively just have to throw the
car back in a track mode and drive it
around until you can regen enough to
then use reverse in the car so yeah
interesting Quirk but with that V6 and
the electric motor combined you've got a
total of 691 horsepower and 531 lb feet
of torque which is a lot but when the
coupe version of this car dropped it
only had 670 and for the 20 5 model year
cars McClaren up that number to get you
to that 691 but if you bought an early
model year car that didn't get the 690
from the factory you can actually take
it to the dealership and they'll ECU
tune it to get it to that 691 for free
so car manufacturers let's definitely
normalize free ECU Tunes that's a that's
a great idea and we'll dig into how that
factors into real world performance a
little bit later but for now let's hop
in we've got this new uh door latch
mechanism doors go up beautifully of
course and uh yeah hopping inside the
Artur which is definitely a tight cabin
for
sure let's close that door
here it is very similar inside to what
you've got in pretty much all the other
McLarens if someone hopped in here who
wasn't like a car nerd you probably
would not be able to tell a single
difference between this car and a 750s
for example in terms of the Interior
experience McLaren is kind of a one-
siiz fits-all
when it comes to their interiors and
their cars McLaren has always sat
towards the top of the Supercar
infotainment food chain in my opinion
Lamborghini if you saw the revolto
review not only is the software pretty
archaic but the way in which you have to
configure basic things like Bluetooth is
almost infuriatingly difficult Ferrari
with software like what they had in the
Puro sway the UI is not bad but the way
in which you control the UI with the
capacitive switches on the steering
wheel it's pretty bad McLaren their UI
isn't great as far as cars in general go
and the way in which you control the UI
isn't great as far as cars in general go
but compared to other supercars it's
definitely the best it's by far better
than Lamborghini and Ferrari if you ask
me the UI is pretty basic there's not a
lot going on here and it doesn't have
you know the fluidity of a Tesla or like
a lot of these cool Chinese Eevees that
we've been playing with recently on the
channel it's definitely very simple but
when you keep in mind the fact that this
is a sports car that's focused on
driving I'm not necessarily mad at it in
the same way I am with Lamborghini which
I mean their software just not great at
all so you do have apple carplay and
that's effectively where I live most of
the time when using this car and it
works fine the only caveat is that you
can only get it in wired via one of
these two ports which keep in mind also
this is the glove box because there is
no traditional glove box for the car so
what you have here is effectively you're
only inar storage minus the pockets on
the door sill there but yeah this is
your glove box and right here you have a
USB C port and then a usba a port and
this one is used for Apple
carplay I've had like a few minor
hiccups Just Like Music cutting out for
like a second when I interact with my
phone while carplay is connected but
other than that it's very reliable very
smooth the software overall is just very
solid you have your climate controls
right here I turn it off because I don't
want it to make noise but climate
control works absolutely fine that's not
an issue and there isn't really much you
need to touch in this car anyway once
you get apple carplay going which at
least you have in the car unlike the
Lamborghini revolto for example you do
have your audio settings right here to
control the Bowers and Wilkins speakers
which dude McLaren does not get enough
credit for how good the speakers in
their cars are we've got the Bowers and
w
system right here and it is absolutely
amazing for a super car at least I'm
shocked how good the sound system in
this car is you got really good lowend
which I feel like has something to do
with the fact that you now have the
carbon tub that is optimized to have the
subwoofer fit inside of the tub really
peaky highs solid mids it gets loud
enough in the car just very good sound
system in general it's one of the best
I'd say it's even better than the best
that Porsche has to offer for example
and definitely better than the best of
Ferrari and the best of Lamborghini as
far as the superar goes the speakers in
here are honestly top tier if I were to
nitpick anything about the interior
experience I just wish there was a
version of a mclaran steering wheel that
you could option to have controls like
in these little spaces right here if I
could just have that and just have basic
media control buttons right here or
maybe a call button or something like
that or maybe even something to go up
and down on the AC that would be cool as
well because this is the kind of car
where you want to stay focused and I
feel nervous even just looking at the
screen for a second because of how
intense a Driving Experience of a
McLaren can be so if I were to just be
able to have just a couple buttons on
each side that would be really great and
I hope that's something that McLaren can
make an option in the future but
speaking of this area right here this is
our gauge cluster setup which all of
this is one unit so if I turn that dial
right here the entire cluster moves
forward which is actually pretty sick
it's one of the cool features about
McLaren so right here's your glage
cluster I said glage cluster gauge
cluster that gives you all the basic
information about what's going on with
the car from a performance standpoint
and you have these two binnacles on each
side that then control the suspension
settings on this side and then the
powertrain versions on this side or
powertrain modes sorry so right now it's
an electric mode and as you can see it
says 17 mil of range which I mean it's
more like 13 14 probably maybe 12
because I'm in these super hilly areas
up in the mountains right now but yeah
right now we're in electric mode and so
I can hit this binnacle go into comfort
and then I hit
Sport and the engine just fired on and
then right here I can do this and now we
have sport suspension and then track
suspension a pretty simple setup overall
gives you just basic information of
what's happening with the car you got
your rev counter up top because this
revs to over 8,000 RPM and I'm a big fan
of this gauge cluster setup I think it's
really easy to read easy to use I'm a
fan personally but that's the McLaren
Ura interior experience in a nutshell
not really anything is different from
the 750h which I feel like is fine if it
ain't broke don't fix it I still would
love some steering wheel buttons but
outside of that really isn't much
missing with the interior experience of
this car if you want something else
you're probably looking for a different
car entirely I should show you how
freaking fast the top lifts on this car
it's probably going to be less than 10
seconds it is insanely
quick that was probably like 11 seconds
maybe which is still pretty good also
another thing to note we have the
electrochromic roof so I hit that
button DET tints now it's tinted again
pretty cool stuff
yeah I like it if you want to drop an
absolute bag over at McLaren special ops
they can hook you up with a pretty
Unique Interior experience our friends
over at the trip F collection are a
pretty good example of that but outside
of that McLaren's always been like a
more utilitarian focused brand when it
comes to the interior experience where
they have always been unique and where
they've always stood out has been the
Driving Experience so hold on give me
one second how has McLaren's most unique
car or how does McLaren's most unique
car since the McLaren P1 hold up when
actually driving it on the road good
very good right now we're in electric
mode for the drivetrain and track
suspension which is why you can't hear
anything it's a very interesting setup
to use here in the canyons but if you
want to rip around for a few miles
without making any noises this is a good
way to do it I guess but let's get that
engine fired on so looping back to why I
think the arura had such a rocky start
upon its initial launch well it's simply
because they had a myriad of Technical
and build quality issues that not only
reviewers were experiencing but
customers as well early adopters of the
car and you have to remember the fact
that McLaren is not a large company
they're a very small company and they
don't have the same Financial backing
that Volkswagen group does with Audi or
Ferrari now that they're publicly traded
company but I can confidently say that
with the 25 model year cars they've
really dialed everything in I've had
zero build quality issues zero
mechanical issues and I can confidently
say that this is by far the most
complete and most compromis free McLaren
for the road that they've ever made so
despite the V6 being a completely brand
new engine it truly does have a lot of
that same character of the flat plane V8
they use in the other McLaren it's a
very rev Happy Engine it spins to over
8,000 RPM and is very eager to give you
those downshifts super high in the Rev
range there are two things that I would
say are missing from the overall
experience of the V6 that you've got in
the V8s uh the first thing is the pops
and bangs you're not getting those epic
pops and crackles that you would get on
downshifts with the V8s and the 750s and
the Senna and the P1 and things like
that and you're also not getting those
epic induction sounds that
sounds that you would get in the V8s
either this car is still twin
turbocharged like the other mcclaren's
but for whatever reason I'm not really
hearing a lot of that same uh induction
noise you're not getting that same epic
induction theater that you get with the
other McLarens but outside of those two
things this really does offer I I think
I can confidently say 80% of the same
overall experience that the V8s have in
those cars but of course what sets this
car apart from other McLarens in the
lineup up is having the hybrid
powertrain so what this electric motor
does is what McLaren is calling torque
infill which is effectively just like
what any hybrid performance car does
giving you that instantaneous shove
without having to wait for the Boost to
kick in with the motor you see I'm
getting that instantaneous like you know
that instantaneous shove mcclaren's are
fast cars they're extremely powerful
don't get me wrong but they're also very
laggy you're not getting a lot of that
shove until much higher in the Rev range
which is a part of why McLaren can be
kind of scary and unpredictable at
certain points but what you've got here
with the Hybrid Power Plant allows for
very smooth and linear acceleration it's
still fast don't get me wrong we've got
690 horsepower here but the power
delivery is much more smooth and linear
compared to other McLarens like the 750s
for example and so from an acceleration
standpoint not only is it more
instantaneous than what you get in
something like the 750s but it just
makes it the most easy McLaren to drive
from a power delivery standpoint it
quite simply just isn't as scary to
drive as other McLaren which is a part
of the Fun Factory of the car so if you
want to buy a superar that kind of
frightens you at the same time this
might not be the best choice but if you
want to hop into the brand but not feel
as intimidated every time you get behind
the car and want to push it a little bit
hopefully on a track right this is a car
that I feel like you should consider for
that it goes without saying that the
handling in this car is obviously s tier
it just weighs barely over 3,400 lb and
it's obviously Mid Engine so the overall
handling and balance of the car is
really great the front end is always
talking Tua it's just a very
communicative Driving Experience and of
course we have the electric hydraulic
steering so an electrically powered
hydraulic rack so the steering feels
very natural very communicative you just
feel like you're connected to the road
and you and you have a good
understanding of what the car is doing
at all times the hydraulic steering is
one of the most unique things about
McLaren and all of their cars and I
really hope they hold on to it for as
long as they possibly can maybe even in
an EV that would be kind of cool if they
could pull that off but what's really
surprising to me with this car is how
good it is to actually daily drive and
just use for regular stuff the overall
suspension setup is actually very
compliant for a car like this which is
actually really surprising when you
consider the fact that this doesn't have
the fancy schmancy active hydraulic
setup that allows for really precise
body control that's one of the things
that makes the 750s and 720s so good is
that active hydraulic setup you just
have traditional coilovers anti-roll
barss in this car you don't have that
setup and despite that you still have a
really good handling car not only for
performance but for daily driving you
know McLarens are fun they're very fun
cars to drive but pretty much every
McLaren I've driven up to this point
it's like I drive it for an hour or so
and I'm like yeah I'm I think I'm good
after like an hour of driving in this
car though I'm not getting that same
level of fatigue and I'm super eager to
get behind the wheel every time I need
to go somewhere I've driven this car not
only in these canions but in stop and go
LA traffic and things like that and
really rough roads and like kind of
really bad paved neighborhoods and it's
been absolutely fine let's just end this
with hearing some V6 noises which I mean
normally when you hear someone say that
you're like V6
[Music]
but
wow wow wow
[Music]
wow yes yes yes yes
nasty I like
it boy so we know McLaren had a rocky
start with the arur there was a lot of
issues reviewers and customers were not
exactly thrilled with the outcome of the
initial launch but I think they heard
that feedback and they were like you
know what it's time to lock in I think
that's exactly what they did this car
sounds pretty good for a V6 over overall
dynamically it's phenomenal you can
truly daily drive this car having the
open top experience obviously makes it
better somewhere here like California
the sound system in the car is amazing
Apple carplay works fine I think it's
the most refined most complete most
compromised free McLaren experience you
can buy right now and unless you're a
track guy who needs something that's
more optimized for track use in my
opinion McLaren artura is Peak McLaren
Road car right now but I did hear word
on the street is that there is a new
hybrid McLaren coming out not too long
from now I think I need to drive that
car talk to you guys in the next one"

never coming out but there are some that
actually do want to come out and so this
video is going to be me ranking some of
the startup companies and start
EVS that I've seen that aren't shipping
yet but that might have something to
them they haven't actually come out but
there may be some ideas behind them that
we do actually want to come out cuz
competition is good so here's my startup
tier list ranking EVS now before I get
into these companies real quick just
keep in mind the context of what
actually worked right we have all these
super super old car companies in the US
Tesla comes along with their master plan
which is starting with a high price low
volume vehicle Tesla Roadster and then
moving to a not as high priced but
higher volume vehicle Tesla Model S and
eventually making it to the mass
production model 3 and model y that much
more people can afford that's how they
actually pulled this off if you're going
to be a new startup in the US you not
only need a master plan that's going to
work but you also need a differentiator
that's a little bit different so I'm
sitting in rivian the rivian thing was
the adventure vehicle it's a pickup
truck it was one of the first EVS to
actually work as a pickup and the Lucid
was they're kind of still in the high
price low volume segment but I still
think they're trying to work their way
down in price as well with higher
materials and stuff and better
efficiency so that's what's worked so
far so vehicle number one I'd like to
talk about or company number one Faraday
future so FF Faraday future was started
founded in 2014 and the vehicle that
they showed was the Faraday future ff91
you might remember on the MKBHD Channel
Channel I actually made a video with the
ff91 in
2017 this was when they showed me a
production spec version they wanted to
ship and they also showed me an
engineering prototype that could drive
so it was like a a finished looking car
and a finished driving car separately
and soon they would combine them and
start shipping the thing uh they haven't
gotten that far yet they've run out of
money several times in the process
trying to get there their differentiator
though was this was going to be a super
super Elite Elite extremely luxury but
also high performance SUV so the ff91
was like 1,000 horsepower it would have
triple electric motors 142 KW battery
pack 0 to 60 in 2 seconds typical like
crazy EV startup specs they also had a
bunch of self-driving Tech attached to
it that they demoed for me and the
starting price would be
$339,000 so they've had to find a market
for this
again it's a it's a cool car but like
you have to find people who are willing
to buy a $300,000 car from a new company
and then who's going to service it and
Al all these other things too which are
a challenge so yeah it it hasn't come
out yet and it doesn't look likely to
ever actually happen so I'm giving
Friday future a c their C tier I think
even if they did bring it to production
it's not anything so amazing or
groundbreakingly new that it would have
done much it wouldn't have made much of
a dent I think that could move a few
thousand units a year just being super
expensive is going to price you out and
you know they're at CES every year
showing new brand stuff that they want
to do but yeah they're they're kind of a
they're they've been at this for a while
also I just kind of want to highlight
that I'm I'm being watched right now I
don't know if you can see that but I
think they're slick by turning around
but I see you uh faray future see all
right next up Lordstown Motors now some
of you might remember that name the
Lordstown endurance it was founded in
2018 this company and they were supposed
to make a pickup truck a consumer pickup
truck the endurance now here's the thing
this is early again this was before
rivan this was before any F-150
Lightning this was before any cyber
truck so the unique thing about it was
supposed to be one that it's a pickup
truck and two The Hub mounted Motors now
the pickup truck part itself I thought
was pretty solid it had a decent looking
design not too crazy it had those cool
lights or whatever had a a normal siiz
bed it would have a 440 horsepower power
train 8,000 lb of towing capacity is not
terrible uh I think it would have about
174 miles of range though which is not
that high but overall it would have been
one of the first EV pickup trucks
Unfortunately they never got enough
financial momentum to actually get it
there and I think they ended up having
to Pivot to Fleet stuff and we just
don't really have the Lordstown pickup
truck today as they would have liked I'm
going to give the Lordstown an e because
it's not here's the thing if they
actually finished it and actually
shipped it today as what they had
planned it still wouldn't actually be
that interesting I'll tell you why the
The Hub mounted Motors seem cool right
and this would have been $65,000 truck
if they had actually been
successful but the thing about the Hub
mounted Motors is they say that this
would have been great for
efficiency but they never really got or
advertised particularly amazing
efficiency numbers and the other thing
about Hub mounted Motors so we we have
these EVS that we've seen everywhere now
it's a battery pack and the motors on
the axle but they wanted to mount the
motors at each wheel basically in each
wheel which would have made this a quad
motor all-wheel drive pickup truck which
sounds really smart but the thing about
having the motor unsprung being in the
wheel instead of sprung by the
suspension un sprung mass is so
important for vehicle Dynamics and if
you want this truck to be at all
off-road capable or even drive
particularly well having all of that
weight in the wheels would not have been
a a good tradeoff because the truck's
not actually more efficient so anyway
long story short poor execution on what
turned out to not really be that great
of an idea which is why we don't see uh
Hub Motors everywhere today at least not
yet maybe the technology has improved
and it is way more efficient now we
might see that later but the way
Lordstown had it set up never really had
any momentum so Lordstown etier so next
up app Terra Motors oh it
is way too cold for a cat to be hanging
out outside but hey it's Carney that's
what they do um aptera Motors okay you
might have heard this name before and
they this they are like teetering they
are teetering on allegedly actually
shipping a bunch of these things but the
aptera car was supposed to just
efficiency Max maximum efficiency EV and
the idea of that is pretty interesting
this was a small three wheeled car that
had solar panels on it whose primary
goal was to be as efficient as possible
minimum rolling resistance maximum
aerodynamic efficiency the most possible
range out of the least possible energy
and that is a appealing idea if you can
actually ship it at a low enough price
that it feels feels like it's actually
worth it so they were founded in 2006
believe it or not long time ago and they
have been sort of born and reborn
several times since then but the idea
was that this would have a 400 mile
range and the solar panels would get you
in a sunny place up to 40 mil of free
range per day because it's so efficient
that just a tiny bit of energy from the
Sun can get you 40 miles and it would be
only $30,000 that's the
idea that was the idea so look I think
it's Noble to want to design the most
efficient vehicle possible but as far as
that actual vehicle coming to Market I'm
putting the ABA in my D tier I it's just
hard to imagine a tiny passenger vehicle
like that succeeding in America I think
it might have a better chance in Europe
and some places where smaller cars are
more popular but I just do not want to
be in that on the road yes people buy
motorcycles but the aptera is not a
performance focused TV It's just in a
niche of a niche that it just doesn't
feel like it's going to work now they
are like I said teetering I think they
just partner with Pina and are going to
do design with the former design house
that did work for Ferrari and like
they've had thousands and thousands of
reservations and they have very vocal
fans you might see them in the comments
below of people who really want this
thing and believe in it and want it to
ship um but it's been teetering for a
long time so it doesn't feel like
they're about to be everywhere on the
roads we could be wrong but it's my D
tier so then next up is a company called
canoe they're a little bit more of a
confusing one they started in
2017 and their differentiator was just
mainly going to just be design so they
had these EVS they actually one of them
was like a pickup truck one of them was
a van they had a couple models that they
showed people and honestly I think the
design was pretty sweet it's what got a
lot of people's attention I think the
idea of having this cool van that could
roll around and be totally silent and
efficient was appealing at the time they
would have a 200 M range and maybe 2 to
350 horsepower an 80 KW hour battery
pack and they would start at around
$43,000 for both models uh again never
really got the financials in place and I
think they've shifted to Fleet and
started doing stuff like like postal
Vans and a couple other more Fleet
oriented vehicles um so there is no like
Mass Market canoe and they've again
confusingly they've also talked about
this modular platform that they were
going to start I'm not even going to get
into the details of that but I think it
would have been cool if we had that
initial van concept or that initial
small truck concept with that sweet
design actually come out um and at that
price it would have been neat there
wasn't anything
technologically super cool about it that
would have set it apart it would have
just been a design play and so just for
that I'm going to put it in C tier if
they executed on that at the price they
promised with that cool design I think
people would have really loved it okay
next up the AA car now this one is
interesting this one's kind of pure CES
the Sony car so you might remember at at
CES in like 2023 I guess two years ago
they first showed this off now keep in
mind I've been to a lot of CES I've seen
a lot of random cars at CES that are
never going to ship I go to the Sony
booth and there's a car sitting there
cool Sony you make screens and and a
couple a couple other things that could
be in cars
but a whole car seems a little crazy but
now it's
2025 and they've continued showing this
off and are actually announcing that
they're going to do this they're going
to have a price it's going to start at
$90,000 it's going to be nacs and
they're partnering with Honda for a lot
of the other car stuff which actually
makes it feel like it could really come
out I don't know I don't know if they're
trying to do it this year or next year
or what but but it feels like a solid EV
with a good enough range it has a
reasonable design and they're saying
it's going to have something like a 300
mile range 480 horsepower 91 KW hour
battery and then of course Sony makes a
lot of sensors and make camera sensors
they are emphasizing heavily the
self-driving aspect or at least the Adas
aspect of this car so it would be
high-tech enough that maybe it could be
a Tesla
alternative in a world where people are
looking for Tesla Alternatives this does
feel like it could find success and then
you have Honda and Sony who have enough
money ideally enough resources to bring
it to Market this
feels as weird as it sounds this feels
like it could actually happen I don't
know if there's going to be a Sony logo
on the steering wheel or anything like
that but the Aila I'm going to put it in
B tier nothing too crazy about it could
be one of the first NAC probably not one
of the first but nacs car nice so then
okay other side of the CES car coin the
Dyson
EV similar thing you hear Dyson making a
car and then you go to the Dyson booth
and they're like yeah we're going to
make a car and you're like okay Dyson
you make you make electric motors so
there's that and they've had a long
history of being a little bit crazy
about making things outside of their
normal uh products but yeah you know
cool be Innovative so they announced
they said they're going to do a car and
they had some pretty crazy specs to go
with it they wanted to have a large
7-seater SUV doing 600 M of range with
150 kwh hour battery and it would have
500 horsepower and do 0 to 60 under 5
seconds and it would have a base price
of
$184,000 so that's kind of all the
details we have and again then it's like
who's going to buy a Dyson car when you
know they don't have a a Honda like
partner as far as I've seen them announc
they're they're just Dyson and there's
got to be Dyson car dealerships and
Dyson service centers and all this a
Dyson log I don't know there it just
seems a little weird there's not really
enough story for me to grasp on to
there's not enough technological
difference that would make me want to
pay twice what you could get a regular
car for three times 180 Grand dang yeah
I'm giving I'm giving the Dyson uh
that's going to be F tier I don't think
that's going to happen so then last but
not
least fiser
Fisker is a car a startup company making
EVS in the US and they have also had a
troubled Rocky past they had this weird
hybrid they went out of business they
came back the Fisker ocean is the latest
of what we have to evaluate from Fisker
and uh they are currently out of
business now but the vehicle that they
plan on shipping if we just look at the
fundamentals of what they were
promising was actually pretty close I
mean I we clearly had one here it got
onto the roads it started actually
shipping and it was pretty promising 350
M range pretty decent looking design it
was a a larish crossover SUV with a lot
of trunk space it would have about 470
horsepower there were some interesting
things like they would have a solar roof
option which could be cool in California
like places um and I think they would
have probably been up to switching to
nacs by now and they were going to start
at $40 to $60,000 unfortunately their
story was really just a matter
of probably just letting the cookies out
of the oven a little too early like
their their their idea of a product
would have been very popular but they
never shipped more than about a few
thousand of them and the software issues
they had the bugginess the quality
control issues that they had could have
been overcome but their their reputation
and their their lack of compet
management I think would be the things
that took them down and that eventually
they couldn't recover from so the idea
of the vehicle and the thing that could
have added to competition to Tesla here
in the US I think Fisker might as well
be a tier I mean they they had a car on
the road for a reason people were buying
the thing there are still Fisker fans to
this day um and the idea of a 350 M SUV
that has a bunch of space and looks
pretty good like people want that it
doesn't even here here's an interesting
compliment to that car it didn't really
look super electric if that makes sense
like I see a couple EVS out there like
the lyric looks very electric with those
lights and the ev6 looks super electric
and the rivan obviously with those
headlights they all look super electric
I think the Fisker served the best
chance of getting normal people to go oh
yeah I think I'd want to buy one so
that's why it's a tier but obviously uh
things didn't work out in the end they
didn't they didn't weather the storm in
any sustainable way so that's it that's
my tier list thank you CES for the
motivation hopefully we see some more
cars that are uh not Vapor that actually
do come out not that Tesla's immune from
vapor in the first place do you remember
the Roadster that thing's 2017
announcement still hasn't come out Jesus"

self-driving car evaluation for July
2024 the idea behind this test was okay
self-driving cars are somewhere in the
future off on the horizon but what's the
best available right now what is
actually the best that each of these
manufacturers has to offer and so the
idea was I'm going to get my hands on
all of them and test them all at once on
the same exact route same time of day
same traffic same everything and take
notes and see which one's better I'm
actually going to do tier list I think
just give my opinion on which ones are
good at certain things and bad at
certain things so I got my hands on the
best from uh the Mustang so Ford GM
Mercedes Tesla and BMW back to back to
back to back to back testing them all
and seeing what they're good at and so
without any further Ado yeah let's just
jump in these are my results so the
first car we jumped in was the Ford
Mustang Mach e so that's Ford's blue
Cruise blue cruise I have some
experience with in the past we did that
Thousand Mile Road Trip where we had the
Machi also and used blue Cruise a lot
for that but blue cruise on the route
that we took here are my notes it's fine
it handles regular roads like a kind of
like a grma the following distances are
all kind of far meaning you can change
the follow distance to be as close as
possible or as far as possible and all
of those distances were kind of far but
that's fine it just means you're going
to get cut off more often and you kind
of have to be okay with getting slowed
down over and over again because you get
cut off over and over but it was a
decently natural breaking and distance
following and steering so anytime I did
get cut off or anytime the car in front
of me did anything like speed up or slow
down it felt like a natural speed up or
slow down instead of like a robotic
speed up or slow down like some others
have had I also wrote down it it only
really works on highways so the route
that we have started off in a parking
lot and then pulls off onto another road
with an entrance ramp and some turns and
everything it just didn't really work on
those roads at all even though they're
lined roads regular roads people would
drive on didn't work on those roads but
as soon as he got onto the highway and
aligned Highway everything would light
up I'd enable it and I'd go so it's
really just best for highway driving
which is also true of a lot of these
systems and it's really reluctant to
change lanes so you can ask it to change
lanes for you but once you do it checks
the spot it waits a couple seconds and
sometimes doesn't really want to change
lanes or waits a little while for the
card to pass it's very reluctant to
change lanes so overall I'm putting blue
Cru as C tier for me just because I feel
like it's right in the middle it's not
too great at anything but it is natural
and it's fine and if I'm tired on a
highway or if I have a I've had a long
day and I don't really feel like driving
and there's a lot of traffic I would
enable it just knowing that I'm probably
going to get cut off a bunch and it's
not going to make up any time it's just
going to sit in the Middle Lane or the
right lane and just chill and be fine so
blue cruise see tier so then next up was
the Chevy Silverado EV with some extra
experience factored in from a lyric both
with GM's super Cruise so this is
interesting I remember I had the lyric
for a bit and I I didn't really use
super Cruise much but now this is the
latest version of it it's the latest and
greatest for the GM self-driving Suite
in a bunch of their
vehicles and some good stuff here so I
wrote down actively changed lanes
without me asking so this this could
feel like a good thing or a bad thing
depending on how assertive you want to
be but it got on the highway and without
me even asking it identified a faster
Lane and the slow traffic in front of me
flipped the blinker on moved over
confidently and did all of that and
started accelerating up to a better
speed I think that's great honestly I
think that's very natural in human so
then I also wrote down when I signaled
it would let me change lanes by steering
and maintaining speed and then
automatically re-engage
so if I saw a lane change I wanted to
make I would hit the signal and move
over and you would see on the screen
that it would disengage the full
self-driving element and then when i'
get back into the middle of the lane it
would light back up again and enable I
think that's good too it's it's again
natural if I just find something I want
to do it's available on more roads so
there were some entrance Rams and some
longer roads that weren't highways that
it was able to work on and it was also
very natural it drove very normal it has
a closer minimum follow distance and it
reacted to things happening on the road
really really well I'm putting this in B
tier because it does all of the same
stuff well that Ford system does but it
just works in more places and is more uh
able to act like a human and following
closer not get cut off as much and then
it's able to change lands a little bit
better than Fords did so yeah B tier
feels right for super cruise I was
impressed it's just a little bit less
than like full self-driving it's still
disables from time to time but this was
good I was happy to use super Cruise so
then I hopped into the Mercedes system
in this sweet AMG S63 performance and
this system is called Drive pilot one
thing to note about all these systems is
they all have a different way of
activating them like sometimes it would
be a stock a lot of times it would be
like buttons on a steering wheel this
one was buttons on the steering wheel
and you'd have to like hit more than one
button to get all the parts of the
system on anyway once you figure it out
it's pretty easy this one has its Lan
keep assist and then also active
steering assist and auto lane change and
once they're all on like everything on
the dash lights up green and they worked
on pretty much every road so that was
good to see uh it did a smart automatic
Lane change which I wrote down was happy
it also got cut off and handled it well
basically all of these systems and I
think this is this is going to just be a
safety thing like they don't want to
follow super super close so even at the
minimum minimum follow distance they're
leaving enough room to react pretty
smoothly so I guess this might be a New
Jersey thing but that means are going to
get cut off so how well does it react to
getting cut off hopefully pretty
smoothly and naturally this one did
honestly the HUD Graphics were the most
important impressive part um of like
overlaying the arrows on the ground and
at your turns where you're navigating
but that's that's just a Mercedes thing
often stopped Auto steer and I would
take over and it would automatically
turn back on so this is one thing where
there were the lights on the dashboard
telling me which parts of the system
were on and it would do the auto speed
thing and keep the speed with the car in
front of it but very often it would
disable the auto steer and if the road
starts turning I got to grab the wheel
again and then I'd hold it for a while
get myself in the middle of the lane and
then it would re-engage and I don't know
it's kind of weird that part of the
system would turn off and there were no
Chimes or confirmations other than the
green lights on the dash about when
things turned off and back on again
that's my that was my real complaint
with this system I off also wrote down
kind of late and wide with turns so not
as natural at the actual
driving and actively asked for pressure
on the wheel every few seconds another
system also did this uh if you don't put
the pressure on the wheel it shows a
warning on the dash and then we'll
eventually start pulling over and doing
an emergency stop so you actually do
have to put your hands on Wheel every
few seconds um and manual Lane changes
it didn't seem to want to do so this
one's an interesting mix it it's clearly
a capable system it's got all the
sensors it when everything lights up it
all works but it seemed a little more
hesitant to have everything on all the
time and it didn't drive as naturally
with the turns and things like that so
I'm also putting this C tier right in
the middle so then next up I got in the
Tesla Model 3 you can see it's not the
refresh but a hardware 3 car with
self-driving version 12.5 and I'm also
going to factor in some experience off
camera with version
13.2.1 from a a cyber Tru this is the
one that's iterating by far the most of
right away the difference was actually
pretty Stark because as we're leaving
the parking lot I hit the button to
enable it on the steering wheel and it
enabled right away which none of the
other systems would I was at least you
know three four turns out onto a bigger
road before any of the systems would
turn on this one leaving the parking lot
it's already turned on and it actually
stopped for the stop sign and the trains
that are like right between us and the
main road so anyway this one basically
works on every single road which was a
pretty big difference versus the other
systems the accelerator pedal can still
work while leaving you in the
self-driving system so if you find
yourself like too slow and you're about
to get cut off or if you need to
accelerate out of a situation or
something you can hit the accelerator
and it'll speed up but then slow back
down and stay in the self-driving system
I'll talk about why later but I use that
a lot in Tesla but tesas I wrote very
good human-like reactions to traffic
slowdowns and getting cut off one of the
scariest things that can happen in a a
self-driving car if you're like me and
you're testing it and you refuse to
interrupt it is you're going highway
speed and on the horizon you can see a
Slowdown in traffic where everyone
stopped and you're just hurdling towards
them at highway speed and impressively
the Tesla with enough distance saw all
that traffic and started slowing down
well before and even as it pulled up was
like reasonable and it was firm on the
brakes but it was it was humanlike which
I appreciated okay sometimes starts a
blinker and then cancels it so this this
system is very willing again also to
auto lane change and so there's actually
more than one mode of the self-driving
full self-driving I think it's normal
mode and assertive mode might even be
three but if you have assertive mode
on this system is like a seriously
capable New Jersey driver it will
accelerate into gaps not cut people off
but if you see a gap that's faster and
the traffic front of you is slow it'll
flip the blinker on and accelerate to
make that gap before somebody pulls up
where the slower modes uh the other
modes that are not assertive will be
more likely to let that car pass by
before putting the blinker on and moving
over behind it but yeah assertive mode
was like Mad Max out here it was it was
very willing to jump into gaps and and
to turn really quickly and things like
that but I did notice a few times it
would put the blinker on and then start
the move and then see a car pull up and
then stop and it would actually turn the
blinker off this might have been the
only
system that actually turned the blinker
off now that I think about it it also
reacted to a car with a blinker on that
was about to change into my lane so
somebody was on the right side had a
left blinker on and the car slowed down
and allowed him before he made a move to
cut in I thought that was very human
like this is also the only one to
actually stop at stop signs because it
was the only one that worked on the
roads with stop signs it let me cancel
merges as well with the stock manual
Lane change absolutely perfect the only
fault that I really found is it seems
like it's reading speed limits from
signs like visual signs which can have a
delay um on when the speed limit
actually changes I feel like a lot of
the other systems are getting it from
GPS data or something else because they
would be accurate on the correct speed
limit of the road and would
automatically move up to that speed but
with the Tesla I'd be you know exiting
here at 25 milph and then I'd get on a
road with a 50 mph speed limit but it
would still think it's supposed to be 25
mph so I'm I'm telling it to speed up
instead of it automatically speeding up
or I'm hitting the accelerator to move
it up that's the difference uh I think
the one weakness with Tesla is it didn't
update speed limits as quickly as I
wanted but honestly uh the rest of it a
tier I'm putting it at the top it is not
s tier because it's not perfect and it
does have some room to grow and it's a
little bit skittish sometimes and like I
said it's not always up to date with
speed limits but I'm putting Teslas
after doing them back to back to back
it's definitely eight tier so then last
but not least was BMW system we had a
BMW 530i X drive and we had BMW assisted
driving this is the only one that we
didn't have the most high-end available
software because there is assisted
driving plus but I'll give it the
benefit of the doubt I'll explain the
difference there's again there's like
multiple buttons on the steering wheel
you got to enable it once you get it all
going it lights up on the dash and
you're good doesn't do turns very well
uh there is an assisted Lane change
feature it seems like it was disabled in
the driver assistant settings because it
didn't work for me but the main thing
that I was annoyed by which is the
difference between assisted driving and
assisted driving plus is this one asked
for a touch on the steering wheel every
like 5 Seconds not exaggerating and it
asks for a lot of pressure on the
steering wheel so almost all of the
others when they would tell you to hey
pay attention and have a hand on the
wheel something would light up on the
dash and all you'd have to do is one of
these just a just a little tug a little
toggle or just rest your hand here and
there's enough pressure for it to know
okay there's a hand on the steering
wheel I don't have to warn him every 5
Seconds the
BMW asked for like like a full wiggle
and that started to get annoying because
if you're going on a straight road every
5 Seconds you have to really put
pressure on the wheel that that got
really annoying but I think assisted
driving plus has full handsfree cruise
control which wouldn't have annoyed me
every 5 seconds so I think that's a good
difference to mention uh this was also
manual Lane changes were extremely quick
quick I would hit the blinker and it
would immediately start that lane change
and move over and it was very assertive
so I love that and uh also this was one
that was decent and natural on highways
you can always accelerate to
override uh it has follow distance
control and it had good speed control
but I feel like I'm doing next to as
much thinking about input as regular
driving with the poking the wheel every
5 seconds and it also is one that Chimes
off but doesn't chime back on when some
part of the system re-engages so it's
good to know if you're on a curved Road
or something as soon as Auto steer
disables I need to know and that's when
it Chimes and that's when I have to take
the wheel and continue the
turn but then once you get out of the
turn and you Center yourself in the lane
I kind of just want it to turn back on
automatically it does but with no chime
you just have to see the green on the
Dash so it worked on about the same
number of Roads as the others basically
highways and some other major roads so
I'm also giving BMWs a c tier and that's
why they all that's where they all line
up so this is a long video but I I
learned a lot from this process
basically and I hope you did too but
mainly the thing that people keep asking
me to do is test like okay is is Tesla
self-driving really the best you know
are there really better systems out
there in regular day-to-day life than
what Tesla offers from my experience now
that I've tested these five I could have
added a couple I mean rivian has some I
could have done some more but I think
now that I've experienced these I think
with my tier list it's pretty clear that
Teslas has the major advantage of just
working on more roads you can pull out
of a parking spot in a shop right and
enable it and it will start by trying to
navigate out of the parking lot like
it's that much
more U inclusive of more roads than the
others but I think when it comes down to
just getting on the Highway getting in
the middle of the lane and just turning
it on and letting it do its thing all
these systems are very capable they all
handled traffic very well they all get
cut off and handle it decent levels of
well I think it's impressive that we've
gotten this far with full self-driving
on so many different systems but yeah
it's nowhere near done that's that's the
thing none of these are full forget
about it seat facing the other direction
like hands off no steering wheel in the
car levels of good yet we're not there
yet with these systems so that's what I
learned okay hopefully you learned
something too thanks for watching catch
you guys in the next one peace"
tbcAOqpE3g8,A Hot Take on Jaguar's Rebrand,"Shot on iPhone 16 Pro Max

talking about Jaguar this month and not
in a good way like a lot of reactions to
this new thing that they're doing this
new thing they're trying and I have a
bit of a hot take on it now this is not
me standing up here and saying oh Jaguar
did everything right they've done a
whole bunch of cool things and their new
car looks fantastic and you should love
it but it is a little bit of a different
angle maybe a little bit of a different
food for thought just on the lens I'm
looking at Jaguar's new thing through
that maybe you have haven't heard yet so
basically this is the angle
electrification this whole movement
we've been going through with so many
car companies has given a lot of these
companies a unique opportunity to also
Rebrand themselves and the ones that
need it the most have been doing the
best job of it and jaguar needs this
more than ever they need it bad so like
look at Hyundai for example right what
did you think of Hyundai a couple of
years ago when you'd see a Hyundai car
on the road or you'd consider buying a
car and you'd see that there's Hyundai
dealership you'd think oh yeah those are
those are the pretty reliable budget
friendly cars I've seen them seems like
there's a lot of them pretty good
nothing too special but now when you see
Hyundai you see a lot of ionic fives
ionic 5n a crazy sporty like cult
favorite a little bit you see ionic
sixes all over the place and they've
transformed the Hyundai image actually
into a little bit more of like a tech
forward a little bit more design forward
brand the ionic 5 speaking of speaking
of I didn't plan that at all that was
actually perfect timing but the ionic 5
looks nothing like you know the sort of
classic cars they've got this sick light
design I could not have plann that
better but now I see that and I think a
little bit differently about Hyundai in
general so that was a successful Rebrand
and there was a moment during that where
they had these conversations about
whether they should keep their original
logo or not they ended up keeping it
it's the same logo but it's just a very
different image now and I feel like I
also see a lot of this with their sort
of sister brand
Kia what is this what is what is all
what is going on I'm G to try not to get
distracted here but Kia same thing right
so before this new logo this new Kia
before any of electrification again
nothing wrong with being the sort of
study reliable ho I might get Kia uh the
Kia Soul what did you think of Kia when
the Kia Soul was super popular but now
there's the ev6 I see a lot of those ev6
GTS occasionally the ev9 is also a
totally new thing it's had the success
for them in this big three row
electrification and now I think if Kia
again is pretty Tech forward as being
kind of ahead of the curve a little bit
on making a lot of these things so Kia
has enjoyed a successful Rebrand plus a
new logo on top of it and I think that's
well it's what Jaguar really wants now
historians can tell a much more detailed
version of Jaguar than I can but the
fact is the typical Jaguar customer is a
60 plus year old man has been for a
really long time and they they sell like
a 100,000 cars per year or less they're
they're sort of competing against the
Porsches and and Mercedes and and other
luxury brands of the world and not
really turning over and converting any
of those people and the funny thing
about Jaguar is they actually kind of
were ahead of the curve on
electrification I remember when there
was just a whole bunch of Teslas coming
out and we were looking to see who else
is going to step up from the Legacy
manufacturers and make an EV and jaguar
did they made the ipace you might not
remember the ipace because it wasn't
that great and you don't really see too
many of them on the road in fact most ey
Paces on the road now are wayos and
that's why they have so much market
share but Jaguar kind of did jump in
early trying to be Tech forward first
but it didn't really hook it didn't work
so if you work for Jaguar and I'm not
saying they did this perfectly but if
you work for Jaguar especially in their
PR department or their sales department
and you've been spinning your wheels and
trying to figure out how do we convert
these Bentley buyers how do we convert
these Mercedes buyers they're not taking
the bait they're not buying our cars how
do you really flip things on its head
and actually take advantage of this
electrification thing that's going on
where everyone's having so much success
I'm not going to say the model 0000 is
that answer but it's an attempt at
totally changing everything now we
should be very clear the model0 is a
concept car right so they've done this
whole Rebrand thing you can think what
you want about the commercial but then
they've actually unveiled this concept
car now and the actual car will probably
not look exactly like this like there's
no side view mirrors there's no door
handles it has these crazy doors that go
up and to the side and then inside
there's a ton of moving displays you
know there's no blinker stocks there's
plenty of ultra futuristic materials and
modern lighting all the all the concept
car Classics but you know at least
assume that a lot of these Design
Elements will carry over into a
four-door uh GT EV shipping sometime in
the next few years from Jaguar maybe
it's still has a kind of a longish
looking Hood maybe it still has a lot of
those horizontal slats on the front and
the back the horizontal lights you know
a lot of car companies do fun new things
with light bars now we could expect to
see a lot of that stuff the only real
specs that we've seen is that they say
they're aiming for an EPA rated range of
430 mil and also around 1,000 horsepower
which sounds crazy but that's a thing
you can do with EVS now so again like
former Jaguar they're going to be
targeting Porsche Bentley and other
high-end luxury brands with this new
thing they're still going to be
expensive but when this car finally does
come out let's say it's 2026 2027 when
it does come out they're going to be
hoping that a lot of the things that
carry over from this concept car that
got a big reaction and had everyone in
the world talking about Jaguar for a
month they're going to be hoping that
that lands and that actually starts
getting traction and spinning the tires
now here's the thing a lot of people
don't like that design right they say it
looks kind of crazy they did show a pink
one for some reason which I think is
going to alienate a lot of people but I
honestly think the boardroom meeting
when they were designing that stuff was
like leave nothing the same not the logo
not the proportions not any fundamentals
you can change anything and everything
there is no Heritage nothing is precious
we we have no value in Old Jaguar
anymore we're a new company now I
honestly think that's the way they're
thinking about it and I kind of Wonder
once it lands in person how people react
to seeing one on the street kind of
reminds me of the cybertruck a little
bit the cybertruck universally one of
the most hated Vehicles online if you go
on Twitter or YouTube everyone says it's
ugly everyone says it looks horrible not
everyone but I mean if you if you
generally sample most people it's a very
negative sentiment toward cybertruck but
when you see it in person and when you
talk to people in person
it's it's a totally flipped ratio people
are oh I've seen those online my son
loves that thing oh what is that how
much does it cost a lot of curiosity it
bends necks people actually care about
it and if Jaguar can show up with a
vehicle that looks so different that
when it drives by people actually care
about it that by itself I think they
would consider a huge win for Jaguar so
yeah that's that's where we're at that's
what I'm thinking obviously there's
still going to be a whole whole lot of
evolution between now and when Jaguar
finally ships that thing but I I am
curious to see if it works or not let me
know in the comments if you think it has
a chance at working because I see these
crazy vehicles and I see these other
rebrands I see what happens with Kia and
with Hyundai and the success that
they've had and I I think Jaguar has a
chance to be a player even though the
ipce didn't work for them let me know
your thoughts but that's just a bit of a
different take a couple new angles and
some shots of an in real life type z00 I
hope that's not the name of the car when
it comes out out thanks for watching
catch you in the next one peace"

Awards we're your hosts I'm Marquez I'm
miles and uh today we're going to be
going through a bunch of categories of
cars that have come out this year that
we've reviewed that we think deserve
some recognition for how good they were
at certain things uh we've got some
runner-ups we've got some winners and we
also have an MVP trophy at the end for
our big winner of the night so stay
tuned for that without any further Ado
let's just get right into the awards
because it's freezing yeah starting with
ice Car of the Year internal combustion
engine car of the year yeah so we did
review a few yeah we did obviously a lot
of EVs and hybrids but there were a few
uh and the the mostly performance
oriented ones come to mind so any uh any
Runner reps you'd like to give before
the winner yeah uh the first one that
comes to mind is easily Ferrari Puro
sway I think it was Yeah by far the most
interesting ice car we reviewed kind
ofous yeah I expensive yeah but it's it
was pretty awesome it drives amazingly
it's easily the best big heavy SUV type
car that we reviewed and having a
naturally as rooted V12 it's like
there's not much that gets better than
that from a pure sensation standpoint
backwards doors ample space can't say
that about a lot of Ferraris yeah the
tech was not amazing in fact it was
among the worst
like any car we reviewed this but that's
not a focus of the car so you know maybe
if you're trying to if you got half
million dollars to spend you're not
really looking at that so much but there
was a a pretty clear winner for us I
think yes the ice car of the year for
autofocus is the McLaren
750s yes this car was uh everything we
expected the 720s was already basically
legendary one could even argue good
value I would say honestly yes and that
video we have on that car actually might
not be out yet by the time this video
comes out but it is coming we just
waiting on some backend stuff to be
cleared up but long shorts yeah long
shorts that video is coming I think what
I like so much about it is that is the
perfect blend of old school and new with
the hydraulic steering and it's you know
a lot of cars no matter how fast they
are they're still very easy right so
it's like someone could hop in a plaid
and just go insanely fast without really
feeling anything McLaren still gives you
that kind of old school superar fuel
where it's like you hop in and you feel
like yeah this is a this is a really
high power car that it was like a
go-kart yeah and the thing is it's you
know they make a 765 LT and I've I've
never driven it but I've heard a lot
about how track and harsh that car is
and it does feel like the 750s actually
strikes a balance between I mean it's a
streetable car but it's like go it's a
crazy go-kart type car it's amazing so
it has Apple carplay it has the new
modern McLaren system yeah I'm a fan fan
yeah we have the video coming soon stay
tuned for it it easily wins that award
for us for this year I think it does the
best job at being a super car in the
most stereotypical sense but in a good
way yeah doors go up it was the bright
color the one we had as well so yeah I
love it okay well the natural other side
of that coin is the EV of the Year y the
electric vehicle of the year and we have
a much broader SWAT to choose from here
we had everything from crossovers to
sedans to Performance C s to CS CS
convertibles it was a it was a good year
for EVS more choices than ever um there
is a pretty clear winner but I do want
to mention some others that were
interesting that uh that came out during
the year uh I think one that was a crowd
favorite that a lot of people cared a
lot about was the Lee Auto Mega yeah it
is cold um no the mega had everything it
kind of deserves a name it's like this
three row fed with tech EV that
kind of turned a lot of heads in a way I
didn't expect just because you don't
really see them on the streets here and
it looked really cool I think it
aesthetically was
awesome uh so yeah that that gets an
award mentioned for sure yeah I think
it's it really has opened our eyes to
what's happening overseas in the
electric vehicle space and when we
released that video we had a lot of
comments with people saying that that
car actually isn't yeah like apparently
that great over there and that there are
even better options so next year we
intend on exploring more of that and
finding out like where this really where
this mountain really Peaks yeah there's
other uh other worth mentioning I
thought the Tesla Model 3 Performance
was a huge improvement over last year
and ended up being one of the best
values in the EV space for people who
want that type of vehicle so I'll give
that a mention but I don't know the the
EV of the Year actually was was I we had
the same pick it was pretty unanimous
here yeah uh that would be the Lucid air
Sapphire yeah that
car seems to be impossible just based on
how many things it's good at yeah it has
a ton of space it's really well built
it's incredibly fast it performs well
somehow the suspension is amazing the
steering is great um and they did a lot
of bespoke things with like the traction
control and the tires and just from
cover to cover the front trunk to the to
the back that thing was very well
considered it's obviously super
expensive but there's nothing else quite
like
yeah I mean when you think of an EV that
gives you everything you want all the
groundup EV practicality with the the
immense space inside and out really
great range really solid charging yeah
when whenever you see a range of EVs and
you see the the one with the most range
that's usually the most efficient one
with the least acceleration and that's
still true in lucid's lineup but it
somehow has 1,200 horsepower and 400
miles of range yeah that's like a
smartphone with an overclock chip and
the longest battery life it just doesn't
usually happen like that it's great yeah
so if you made me drive an Eevee right
now that's the that's the easy pick eeve
of the Year Lucid or Sapphire yeah okay
next category hybrids hybrid of course
so the middle of the coin hybrid of the
year we got a couple of these in yeah
there was some pretty epic ones that
didn't make the list like I mean not a
new car but we also drove a McLaren
speed tail this year that was that is a
hybrid yeah as a hybrid it is a
ridiculous car but we do have a we do
have a winner yeah I think just because
it's such a good car in almost every
sense I mean there are certain areas
where yeah it's not the best but I mean
overall from a general standpoint I
think it does the hybrid thing very well
and that car is the Bentley Continental
GT speed hybrid which we also have not
released a video on that one yet kind of
in the same boat as a McLaren video so
come in
at a later date but it is coming yeah
that that was it was fun to drive it was
fun cuz it genuinely has multiple
personalities which is a compliment for
a car when it can be both a chill
relaxed comfortable GT and a sports car
that's that's impressive yeah and this
did it the hybrid system helped it do it
it it's heavy obviously but it has a
decent amount of EV only range which is
a thing that some people want sometimes
at of hybrids yeah uh I think it looks
good it's got a decent amount of storage
you could put I keep saying this in
videos but two sets of golf clubs in a
trunk like it's great I'm loving so yeah
I mean luxury solid Tech mhm amazing
like
speakers I mean you don't have like
really great assisted driving features
just Volkswagen really hasn't dialed
that in yet in most of their cars um but
does like 2.9 seconds 0 to 60 on the
street and really responsive it kind of
reminds me of and this might be crazy
but what may be the new 911
hybrids will feel like because we
haven't driven those yet either no but
from what I see in reviews really really
responsive because of the the hybrid
assistance but in a totally different
mechanical way yeah but same thing the
pedal was really really responsive in
that car so well done on the hybrid
Bentley here's an interesting award most
efficient we want to give an award for
good efficiency it's kind of similar to
the the battery award I've given in the
smartphone Awards where you know you
might not have the biggest capacity
battery but if you make the best use of
your
battery uh that deserves to be
recognized and it's fun for the the end
user to not have to think too hard about
it so okay we've written two down here
and they're kind of neck and neck but
for different ways yeah Lucid air pure
yes what is do you remember the the max
range of the pure something like we got
about like we got nearly 420 miles of
range in that car something yeah the
Lucid air p is a rear wheel drive base
Lucid that has just the most efficient
drivetrain you've ever seen in an AV
it's awesome it also has a pretty big
battery and it's got all the Lucid stuff
that we talked about already it's
comfortable it's well built if you drive
a bunch of EVS you start to look at the
Watt hours per mile number and just kind
of take note of which ones get the best
numbers yeah and the Lucid air Pier is
is typically right around the top of
that list it's super efficient y um but
I'm actually happy with giving the award
to the other one that came to mind which
is the Tesla Model 3 the base Tesla
Model 3 is just the most WorryFree
charging experience EV you can get yeah
and I think that's worth something yeah
I mean they've been doing it for so long
so it only makes sense that they have it
pretty dialed in by the second
generation yeah yeah it doesn't need
because you you see the ones with huge
batteries to get the huge range it
doesn't have a gigantic battery but it
has great range yeah um it typically can
in good conditions be at 18 0 to 200 W
hours per mile which on my scale of 200
to 600 that's about as good as it gets
um you have Tesla charging Network
obviously it charges really fast it's
nacs unlike the Lucid right now it's uh
it's a great WorryFree charging
experience for an EV way to win the
award all right what's next best
performance car okay so we we did a lot
more performance cars this year mhm uh
you know like McLaren speed tail
um one that I think should definitely
get an honorable mention the sacr
Blackbird fascinating car which is
really fun and really shows where you
know you can go if you want to make an
EV actually fun and engaging not exactly
a production car but still got to test
it so worth mentioning yeah um but our
official runner up is the Hyundai ionic
5n the more time has been separated
between like when we got that car in
present day like the more I kind of miss
it and appreciate it totally for how
goofy but still like really fun it is
like I really think Hyundai is on the
right path with their electrification
and just their whole Rebrand strategy of
just making really great cars the range
is pretty awful terrible it's
205 tops I mean I I barely cracked 200
yeah the way people will have fun with
it yeah it's not for the range yeah but
it's easily the most fun attainable EV
that I've personally driven this year
yeah yeah I it checks out I had a lot of
fun making fun of the the sounds and the
fake shifts and the emulating a gas car
and the transmission and all that stuff
but the fact that they actually went
through with it and it works really
convincingly you can Redline it you it's
just it's fun it's really it's really
goofy unabashed fun in an e and uh yeah
Hyundai's on one Hyundai got a lot of a
lot of good stuff going on so yeah that
definitely gets a mention but we have a
winner too yeah we have a winner um
easily the most fun twodo car that we
reviewed on the channel Lamborghini RTO
welto hybrid yeah yeah Lamborghini
basically fixed
every uh functional and fundamental
problem with the Aventador with this car
you have the better trans Mission the
Dual clutch is super Snappy and engaging
M the hybrid system makes the
acceleration instantaneous obviously and
you get like a couple of miles of range
in EV mode technically you do if you
want it but EPA like emissions and all
this stuff like making it harder and
harder to have cars that feel like they
did 20 years ago I feel like Lamborghini
is doing one of the best jobs at still
bringing that very visceral experience
in present day especially with having
like a big old V12 in the car that's not
going to be something that sticks around
for a very long time and the fact that
they were able to do it and make it
better functionally speaking than the
event door that should be celebrated
worthy successor one of the best looking
back of a cars I've seen in a while yes
so shout out to that too yes it also
shoots Flames it does stock yes really
yes
Jesus that's even more icing on the cake
for that one yeah sick all right next
category okay best luck luxury car so
this is the other side of that coin
again you get a performance car you're
you're getting into the like real
uncomfortable cars you're getting into
the luxury cars you're not thinking
about performance much at all you want
you know the Comfort yeah the relaxed
the relaxed ride the soft suspension the
good materials the quality Tech so you
don't have to think too hard you want
all of that and we did get a good number
of of luxury focused cars yeah that came
out this year um
yeah okay technically yeah our runner up
which was kind of unexpected but totally
Falls in this category 100% is the
leeauto Mega you don't you don't think
of that as like luxur car right off the
bat but think about it softest
suspension we felt in forever yeah
amazing Tech from the front seat to the
back seat USB ports everywhere super
super comfortable seats from the front
to the back again it's got the fridge
it's got the heater it's got the screen
that flips down from the top the
wireless chargers and a decent amount of
range and a a fairly worry-free
experience so luxury for the whole
family yeah I mean kind of impressive
it's different than our MVP or actual
winner of the luxury category in the
sense that it's not a great luxury car
in terms of it having like insanely
expensive materials and everything
feeling extremely premium but luxury in
the sense of what it does for you yeah
living with it all of the amenities you
know all of the Endless amounts of Fe
features that just make your life easier
and kind of better with using the car
and it has better suspension than the
actual winner of this category which is
I agree which is sick kind of crazy to
think about so what's our winner uh yeah
the king of softness it's amazing the
Rolls-Royce Spectre king of softness
king of quietness those those are the
two things about that car that really
stand out to me yeah so softness soft
suspension but also you sit in that car
everything from the headrest to the seat
to the the carpets on the floor the
steering wheel it's just a nice soft
interior yeah in a way that you kind of
just sit down and sort of sink into the
seat a little bit and relax yeah but
then it's really quiet and I think
that's a part of the luxury experience
which is when you close that huge door
you put the umbrella back you close the
door you put the windows up and you're
just sort of isolated from the outside
world I remember having this experience
like driving through I think it was
Jersey City or something we were doing
and people got mad oh there's so much
salt on the car I was living with that
car yeah and a garbage truck drove past
me and I didn't even hear it right next
to me a garbage truck not that there's
anything wrong with hearing a garbage
truck but the luxury experience is not
hearing the garbage truck for sure and
they accomplished that it makes a
speaker sound better too it's it's
really absolutely and I mean if you want
an EV and want the most bespoke
experience in terms of specking it
exactly the way you want it you know
like with Teslas and a lot of other EV
companies they're all kind of going to
look the same but if you want an
electric car and want to have a oneof
one spec with like all this all these
crazy colors of materials you can pick
Bary color you could do whatever yeah
it's pretty much the only option right
now so it would also cost you but we
yeah but hey that's part of the luxury
experience too yeah all right we've got
three more categories the bust of the
year is the one that you hate to have to
give but this is a fun show why not
award the bust of the year um look
there's not every car is good but what I
will say is in buying a new car you
typically can't go super wrong if you
know what you're getting into yeah uh
you might buy an ionic 5n and you know
ahead of time you're not going to road
trip that car a lot and depend on it for
long range so you don't really knock it
too much for that you might buy a I
don't know a rivian
r1t you're not going to take it to the
drag strip you don't expect that out of
it unless I guess you get the quad motor
one yeah um
but there was one car that didn't really
perform at all it was just kind of
missing in a lot of pieces and you guys
already know what I'm talking about if
you watch the channel this year uh
that's the Fisker ocean yeah the Fisker
ocean I don't want to you know kick it
wallets down too much but the company
doesn't exist anymore for a reason um
they just never really got it fully
together with the basics of things like
software things like build quality
things like consistency and range and
experience um I actually think it's too
bad because it's a really goodlook EV
yeah practically speaking it makes me
sad because unlike a lot of other like
EV manufacturers that are barely getting
it off the ground I feel like the bones
were there yeah the execution and I feel
like they rushed it to get out and uh it
showed yeah you know a lot of people
were looking forward to having another
option in the like midsize crossover
space like a decent sized trunk and like
some cool color options it had like a
matte paint job that we were looking at
and uh Fisker being a designer first I
think it showed and they did a good job
there it's just then living with it that
it kind of fell apart and they kind of
tried to correct themselves but it was a
little too little too late and so they
are in 2024 pretty clearly the bus of
the year yeah uh they don't exist as a
company anymore
Rip but now we get to an award that's
even more fun to give yeah which is the
most improved
award now I I've started doing this in
the smartphone Awards and it's a fun
award because not a lot of smartphones
dramatically improve year over year but
in the car World it happens sometimes
yeah sometimes you get a pivot where a
company goes oh we're going to change
something up we're going to pull a
Jaguar we're going to go nuts and do
something totally different and so we do
have some most improved mentions here
yeah um runner up is a car that yet
again we have not released a video on
for different reasons than the other two
cars but yeah that video is coming and
uh it is the rivan R1 Gen 2 yeah so I've
spoiler alert I've been living with a
rivian r1t since the launch edition came
out I clearly love the thing and my
number one question I'm kind of spoiling
our video but was how different how much
better is the second gen
actually and it looks exactly the same
from the outside you can only really
tell if you look at the blinkers that
you're standing next to a second gen
versus a first gen but when you live
with the second gen everything from the
suspension to the range to the materials
to the interior finish kind of across
the board they've done a little bit to
every little piece of that car yeah um I
want to test the speakers again because
I've been seeing a whole bunch of
complaints about the new speakers I
didn't have any problem with the ones I
tested but we're getting another one in
soon so we'll be able to double check um
but yeah when you improve range and
charging and materials and comfort and
suspension yeah you've done a good job
yeah it shows that you know listening
and just like being involved on the
feedback end of things it makes a huge
difference but this is not actually our
winner for this category it's because
they didn't fix the wireless chargers
yeah yeah yeah but the
winner model 3 just the regular test
model 3 yeah the Highland as they call
it or as we called it it's not actually
what it's called but the Highland model
3 the new model 3 is across the board uh
it sort of reestablished itself as one
of the best deals and one of the
smartest EVS to buy to actually buy a
lot of people will lease them to but
just practical fast charging decent much
better suspension than the first model
3s which everyone knows were much
harsher yeah um I think better looking
with the new headlights the new tail
lights the new Tesla branding instead of
the te yeah just everything about that
car is is not just a little better but I
think much better than the first yeah
when we first got that car and put it
side by side with the first gen model 3
it's it's easily the most night and day
transformation yeah of any like EV I
think we've we've seen so yeah a true
facelift in every way from the inside
out and obviously the performance model
is is a little icing on the cake there
but yeah model 3 Highland there's a
reason you see them everywhere they're
really
good so I think we've arrived at at the
big award for the night the moment
you've all been waiting for the MVP yeah
the car of the year so I mean I think
the reason this car gets the award that
it does is because I feel like it's a
car that we constantly mention a lot in
the office yeah especially when talking
about EVs and EVS that perform very well
even just cars that perform very well
well in general it's a car that I would
easily love to spend more time with
again and explore exp mentioned it more
than once yeah yeah yeah and it's funny
because we when we first mentioned like
we we should do an award show we should
we should reward the best stuff that
came out this year which you know that
means we're going to have to give an MVP
right yeah and immediately without even
mentioning it we both looked at each
other and we were like we already know
what that is yep so here it is the MVP
for 2024
that is the Lucid air
Sapphire and I don't want to say it's
not close but like when I thought about
this year and the stuff that we got to
test there's a huge variety of stuff fun
stuff practical stuff uh luxury stuff
sports stuff this car is all of that
stuff like I don't know how to make it
more clear if you want a great sports
car this can be that yeah if you want a
great sedan for picking up the kids and
bring in three sets of golf clubs
places there you go if you want to go
400 miles on a charge and go for a road
trip and an
EV there you go that's the one it's that
one if you want to Nuke other cars on
the drag strip literally effortlessly
just stomping a pedal it's that and
there's YouTube channels that do all
those things with this car yes it's
expensive um I think it's clear that
lucd loses money on every single one
they sell because of how much they spent
and I believe it it's got magic susp
ition it's got incredible steering I
could go on and on I am going on and I'm
blabbering freezing at this point that's
the winner yeah much
deserved so yeah this this has been our
first ever yeah I hope we get more award
categories next year too maybe we'll get
some more fun stuff that comes out but
uh let us know if you agree with our
picks or if you disagree I'm sure we'll
get comments of people disagreeing with
our picks but this is the one that gets
a trophy and I hope no one disagrees
with this one but for the rest of them
let us know yeah thanks for
watching peace"

pickup trucks out there right there's a
cyber truck there's the rivan there's a
Silverado EV the Hummer EV but now
there's a new one new kit on the Block
and I I said new but also kind of not
that new because this is basically the
same as a Silverado EV now to a lot of
people that's a good thing cuz that
means it still has that huge front trunk
it still has that huge 205 KW hour
battery which means it still has that
enormous 470 plus mile range still
charges at 350 Kow it still has the huge
6ft bed it still has the midgate in
between the front and the back so it's
fully featured it still has that 754
horsepower all-wheel drive dual motor
action and that paddle shifting
increased regen all of that still here
so okay what's different why is this new
slightly different design different logo
on the front that counts also a
different logo here but I'm going to say
it's because the interior is just
slightly better I think you could argue
it's a little bit more premium I think
the speakers are a tiny bit better and
it's the you can see Edition one over
here but same software just just a
slightly more premium looking and
feeling interior in this one and then
this one also happens to be able to crab
walk that feature from the Hummer EV
where it can turn all four wheels the
same direction and kind of Glide
sideways diagonally kind of it's
debatable how useful that actually is
but yeah this one will cost $3,000 more
than the Silverado EV so would you pick
it over the Silverado or the other EV
pickup trucks let me know"

New York I love being right next to the
Northeast and all the construction and
everything it's great it's just the
thing is shooting car videos in the
winter is just one of my least favorite
things it's one of the hardest things to
do but we're going to do it anyway for
this thing right here this is the pole
star 3 and I was waiting to check this
out I'd seen a lot of these new po star
coming out and I've checked them out in
the past and I've really liked them and
this one similar to the last video like
I said is in that category that's really
crowded the midsize crossover why would
anybody buy your midsize crossover but
now that I've tested this one yo I
really like this one but there are a few
weird things about it it's actually
amazing how far the highest highs and
the lowest lows are from each other in
this thing I'm also glad that this is an
electric car so it'll be nice and warm
and cozy when I get inside it's waiting
for me but we got to show you the
outside first so this is the post start
three This SUV is going to start at
around
$67,000 but that would be for the single
motor lowest than one and you can spec
them right up all the way into the
80,000 uh and this is the performance
spec this is dual motor all-wheel drive
really top tier trim and I think it
looks phenomenal actually they do a lot
of this print stuff with pstar so you
can see the specs right on the side
there you go1 KW battery but design-wise
I love it first of all this is a sloping
low roof line line much lower than I
mean the Acura we just saw and a lot of
other cars in this segment have higher
roof lines so you would think that
headro would be a concern but we'll get
inside in a second you'll see it's not
which is great you've got these big
diamond cut Wheels yellow brake calipers
and then the front design I think is
really nice if I was designing an EV
that had to be aerodynamic but still has
angular elements this has got it so you
see these sort of lines and dots and the
text thing that they do but also this
here is a wing fully functional front
wing on the Pulstar 3 this is creating
downforce and that sort of Smooths the
air over the top of the car again with
this low roof line to this rear wing and
this is also fully functional Arrow
there's not a lot that I don't like
about what they did with this car I
think some people might not like this
one little uh kind of cheesy looking
piece at the back but that is still
functional for aerodynamics you've got
this tail light bar back here that I
also think looks good again pretty low
roof line but in general I like the look
of this this car's design is nice it's
got a lot of bars a lot of thin lines
your blinkers your
headlights good stuff even a good color
I think honestly the it's cold
the hey guys oh God hi the the best
compliment that I can give a car I think
is that this is how I would have
designed it like this if I was designing
a car this is what I would have done and
I love that about a lot of pieces of
this car and and but jeez we should just
get inside because number one that's a
little much for me but also number two
it's freezing um also point out right
here really thin bezels on the mirrors
it's a subtle thing and then this is the
uh key card which you actually fun fact
you would normally think to tap it right
here this is the sensitive spot for the
key card to lock and unlock the pulse
star 3 if you tap it here nothing
happens got to top it over here so the
door handles come out from being flush
you pop it open there
and you get inside and now we are warm
and cozy in the driver's seat and that's
that's where the key go so this interior
again strikes a lot of balance between
the world of like Tesla this super super
minimal you know screens and nothing
else being features inside the car and
actually having nice materials it's
still leans a little bit too far towards
the minimalism and I'll show you why in
a second but I mean look at these look
at this angle right here just just this
right you've got a nice black headrest
with that nice text right there super
thin font heated and cooled seats and
the nice bright yellow seat belts I
think that that is sick that is a great
look these are very comfortable seats
you can see them they have adjustments
so this uh sort of thigh support comes
out as well the whole theme of the
entire car is sort of black and yellow
and it's consistent so the HUD is up
there but you also have a screen behind
the steering wheel and then you have
this single screen in the center but you
do still have manual aack controls and
they're kind of nice looking you've got
this drywood and a bunch of different
materials around the cabin uh this sort
of opens up here and you can see this
one Central piece of storage this is
more open than it was in the Volvo but I
still don't think like I'm never using
this storage what is this
for a water what is it who puts things
back here I don't know it's kind of
hidden uh but two USBC ports back there
and then you've got the center which is
your volume knob and play pause which is
a nice little you know single physical
element there this is again one wireless
charger not two but you put your phone
sideways here or you put your key card
there and then you got your two cup
holders so this is the inside of the
pstar 3 and then okay this is again just
a little bit too just a tiny bit too
digital right so these are all sort of
unlabeled soft buttons on the steering
wheel but you press them and they sort
of activate things inside the car and
when you're
driving you put your hand on that part
of the steering wheel and it tells you
what it's going to do when you press it
so I press my finger on the bottom one
right there it says oh that's going to
be able to change your menus and Views
if you press your finger on the top one
that's your voice assistant which is
it's the g-word voice assistant so it
kind of tries to tell you what it's
going to do before you actually press it
because they're unlabeled buttons um I
don't like this though they decided to
only do one set of window controls and
then you hit that button to do the back
windows so only one set and then a
capacitive button that's like a
money-saving measure thing that I don't
love about it so it's crazy my my take
is that this interior this car in
general is amazing and it's amazing
because how could one car have so many
awesome Design Elements this this thin
bar right here this awesome black and
white contrast and the stitching and all
this stuff how could it have all that
awesome stuff and then also have like
gloss black here and cheap out on a
window and like do all these things like
this glove box only opens with a button
on the touch screen there isn't even a
there's no handle there's no way to open
it other than a button on the touch
screen that's amazing that one car could
have so many great design choices and
also have such poor design choices
here's some other little things right
these are the stocks behind the steering
wheel little bit of gloss that's okay
but listen to the the ping when you hit
park that's nice that's a nice feeling
that's just a tiny little thing but the
click there when you hit Park also over
here those are your front and rear
windshield wipers and you can see if I
hit that rear windshield wiper that it's
a nice thin bezel mirror as well got the
sunroof over our heads you can pick that
as an electrochromic option as well if
you want to um and then I got to say
something these
speakers these speakers okay this is a
Bowers and Wilkins system you can see
the Tweeter up front that's your first
clue this is a nice system right you've
got big speakers up here bigger speakers
down here got woofers behind you even
this this headrest it says Bowers and
Wilkins on it which is a good clue but
this is also a speaker behind your head
this is I'm tempted to say it's either
the second best or the best speaker
system I have ever heard in a car
period period the one I'm thinking of
that's maybe neck and neck with it is
the one from the mybach that I talked
about in that video and the mybot costs
way more than this obviously this is an
amazing speaker system it has Dolby
Atmos support it has a whole bunch of EQ
settings that you can change about it
but even straight out the box Bluetooth
connected to my phone I'll finish a drop
and I'll hit Park and I will sit in this
car and finish listening to the song
before going inside that's how good the
speakers are and of course it's a quiet
car as well there's great acoustic
isolation from the outside but amazing
speakers okay backseat experience does
matter too and this is the part where
you think okay maybe this sloping roof
line is going to be compromising a
little bit be totally valid to think
that but I got inside and I'll move
these uh nice little cushion back
pillows out the way is also pretty nice
so the floor is a little bit high so you
can see there's like a gap I've got my
knees kind of higher off the ground than
usual but leg room is plenty and head
room is plenty it's kind of amazing that
they fit 100 plus Kow hour battery
underneath me and they've got the seats
low enough that there is no problem with
Headroom at all um and then you still
have this nice aesthetic this black and
white so the thin LED lines there's LED
lights all throughout the car you
obviously have your window stuff your
huge speakers back here you have your
HVAC controls and your heated rear seats
and if you want that back pillow you got
it but again the neck pillow the black
and white aesthetic the orange seat bels
I'm I'm such a fan of just the general
design of this car here is one weird
flaw though and it could be consider it
could be worse it could be worse right
but the armrest is in the middle here
and you do get hidden cup holders there
which is nice uh but the path through to
the trunk which some cars don't have but
this one does is Tiny when you open that
up that's the pass through so you could
fit what some golf clubs through there
maybe um kind of an odd tiny little
thing but yeah in general they they
didn't really miss too much in the back
seat here you go hold that
down and that works so golf clubs two
sets of golf clubs all the groceries you
want and sub trunk nice so this is an
advantage over like something like the
ZDX we just saw which is this is a
groundup EV that has a little bit more
spacing or typical electric car so
really happy to see that you also can of
course use that privacy Shield so it's
got all the general practicalities of a
crossover it's got all the Aesthetics
you could possibly want how does it
drive that's the last question I'm going
to get back inside so I don't freeze my
face off while I talk about
driving but this is the performance
oriented one and it does Drive really
nicely so first of all the pstar 3 is on
air suspension in the higher end trims
it is not in the single motor trim but
this is on the air suspension and it it
totally makes up for the huge wheels and
rides really well and with the dual
motors it is a pretty decent performer
as far as acceleration it'll do 0 to 60
in about 4 and 1 half seconds but again
I wouldn't let that number fool you into
thinking it's not quick it's very quick
but we also kind of have to pair this
performance talk with all of this here
this uh this UI this is I mean this is
the only input device in the car this
just a center screen right here other
than these unlabeled buttons so anything
you want to change about the car
settings while you're driving you have
to go through this instead of physical
buttons in order to change their
performance modes in the car and you can
see the performance thing right here and
this always has a the performance button
right here but then I have go to
settings and then drive to access all
the rest of the performance stuff so you
can turn on sport traction you can turn
on creep or turn off creep but if I want
to change the suspension to standard
which is a nice little softer suspension
versus firm that's three clicks away
instead of just a single like mode
switch um the performance button that's
always down here at the bottom all the
time that is going back and forth Just
Between the drive
performance uh where' It Go Power
delivery setting so performance is the
fastest that is all-wheel drive all the
time full power full traction always
available the range setting which you
can switch it to at any time um
essentially decouples the front and rear
Motors and it makes it only a
front-wheel drive car for the most part
so if you don't need a whole bunch of
power it should be totally fine you
drive around town you're cruising on the
highway front-wheel drive all the time
maximum efficiency that is the lower
power motor and so that should give you
the most
range unfortunately this car does not
have that much range again it's kind of
amazing that it can do all of that it
can decouple the front and rear Motors
and even if you stab the accelerator it
takes about 7 Seconds to re-engage the
rear motor and give you all the power
back but even with all that Tech the the
range in this car is not that great this
dual motor version will give you about
270 miles of range on 100%
charge ah wish it was more um but that's
that's fine in performance mode awesome
straight line acceleration awesome
handling um if you hearken back to the
the postar 2 BST I reviewed it's kind of
awesome what they're able to do with
these cars um but then yeah you you have
to deal with all of this all of this
touchscreen stuff which I think looks
really nice but is not the most
functional again the glove box is the
touchscreen button I think that says a
lot about what they're doing with the
software this car um you can log into
Spotify you can do all the Dual be Atmos
stuff you can sort of rearrange these
most frequently used apps at the bottom
uh but yeah this is this is one of the
things you'll have to get used to if you
use this car which is some things are
several clicks away if I want to turn on
seat heating it's one two two clicks
away instead of one instead of just
having a button somewhere it's two
clicks if I want to adjust the fan speed
there is no fan adjustment I have to go
in here and then change fan speed here
or change where the air is blowing
manually here and do this while you're
driving I don't want to do that while
I'm driving so yeah the Google stuff
works great and if you navigate
somewhere that's out of the range of the
car it'll stop at a charger until you
have long to charge it'll do all that
great stuff so yeah it it's kind of a
mixed bag it it is it is really
beautifully designed but not the most
functional thing in the world and that's
basically the story of the pstar 3
I'm at the end of the
day it's kind of like I have a crush on
this car but I know it's not for me like
I I haven't seen that many EVS with a
front Wing like that right there or the
sloping roof line or the rear wing I
think that's awesome the design elements
of this car are all great I just I if I
designed a car it would look a lot like
this but then it has this weak range it
has this kind of a fitsy UI that's not
super not super intu it's missing some
physical buttons and I the speakers are
incredible but I just don't want to
drive this car for road trips so yeah
it's a tough one I like a lot of things
about it it's amazing but that that Gap
is is crazy keep working on it though
postar please please don't stop working
on these all right thanks for watching
catch on the next one peace"

you want it to be just a a little bit
sporty just a little Sporter than the
average model
y well this is an option there's uh
there's the Honda PR log there's the
Chevy Blazer and then there's this
they're kind of all the same thing with
a different skin but this is the Acura Z
DX and it's the sporty one so it's the
type S so because it's a little sportier
it's got less range this is like 280 Mi
of max range and it only charges at 190
KW so I wouldn't road trip in this but
if you'll notice the list I gave you at
the beginning of the video didn't have
road tripping on it so this this could
do it for you so I've reviewed a few
Acuras before and I've lived with a
couple other Crossovers and SUVs from
them but I like the NSX so I have a soft
spot for acur but I think this looks
appropriately sporty I actually think
this color here which is called tiger
eye is maybe my favorite color I've seen
in a car all of this year not even
joking great name great color it looks
like it's showing up well on camera but
yeah that that's tiger eye but honestly
pretty sporty looking in general for a
Type S you've got this line on the front
of the hood I like these LED headlights
at the front like this angle right here
that's looking pretty sporty if you ask
me oversized Accura logo with that
hidden camera in the front there is no
front trunk but if you come around to
the side I think if this trim was black
instead or maybe if that trim was black
it would look a little better but
generally a pretty good- looking
silhouette and then look there's a
million cars in this shape in America
like this little crossover shape where
you've got a hatchback and you've got a
bigger trunk there's a ton of these out
so you can kind of just pick your poison
as far as how much practicality and
range you want to buy how much
performance you want to buy but they all
kind of have to do the same thing which
is have a lot of trunk space right have
a good siiz back seat ideally you can
fold
down that back row and then you get a
whole bunch of extra space there so if
you have like large items you could fit
a bicycle in here if you wanted to um
and then they all have to sort of Drive
in a comfortable enough way that it
doesn't intimidate anyone be practical
and easy to use and uh I would say that
this one accomplishes that the thing
that's going to differentiate this one
from the others is one this is the type
S so it is a little more performance
about 500 horsepower and it's dual motor
so it's all-wheel drive and then it's
going to be a bunch of subtle things
it's going to be things like the fit and
finish inside little bit of UI and
features and materials but in general I
mean if you've lived with an Acura or
seen them before you know they're
practical and this gets a lot of things
right so I'm happy now there are some ex
I would say excess plastic things
happening here um um a lot of this I
mean basically all these buttons and all
the touch points here that you feel are
plastic um but layout wise I think a lot
of people are going to be happy so first
of all it's got the power button a lot
of GM you know that that's just a thing
that they do it also has this pedal
right here behind the steering wheel
which I have grown to really like that's
your pull for extra regen button but you
also have one pedal driving so if you
just hit that button right there you can
turn one pedal driving on or off I think
yep there you go and you can set the
level so if you set it to high you fully
take your foot off and you go all the
way to a stop it's great that it has
that it's got an HUD in front of me it's
got a sunroof it's got heated and
ventilated front seats it's pretty well
equipped it's nice you know you're not
getting jipped for
$75,000 um but then you start to live
with it and at this point there's so
many cars of this shape and size that
the differences between them start to
feel they're subtle but when you live
with them they add up to a big
difference it gets a bunch of little
things that I'm about to say but that
some others in this category might or
might not have so here's an example
right this screen right behind the
steering wheel you can see there's an HD
but I do look at this screen and it's
got this Hood over it and it's kind of a
big projecting hood that actually keeps
glare off of that screen really well I
think that's nice not all of them do
that um here's another little thing
there's a center console here a spot to
put some keys or your phone two cup
holders and then there's a single
wireless charger for your phone which is
cool but a lot of them have two two a
lot of them have one for the driver one
for the passenger and I just kind of
feel like it would have been nice to
have two wireless chargers for your
phone uh and then another one this spot
down here so there's there is some
storage technically underneath this
center console spot I've driven a lot of
EVS that have a a wide open center
console a little bit less traditional
this is more of a normal looking center
console but when it's wide open I find
that if I go get groceries or I have a
backpack or a bag of something I just
got some food I'll just put it in that
middle spot and I feel like I I can't do
that here I really I end up just putting
it on the seat next to me because I just
don't use that center console storage
for anything it's just there um but then
you know you have the software which is
great Wireless Android auto and apple
carplay you see the button for carplay
right there and the software otherwise
is pretty good uh this camera is just a
little bit low that's something I see on
a lot of cars but it's fine this is a
volume knob I love that it's super
useful it's a little far to reach but
again tiny tiny little things but some
other upsides of living with this car
are one it has Google Assistant built in
so anytime you talk to it and if you're
signed in that stuff works pretty
quickly and can use the maps built in
and navigate to Chargers good stuff um
this also has decent sounding speakers
decent so it's a bang and olon system
and you can see one of the speakers up
here there's always a ton of speakers
all around these cars and I guess maybe
I I think I might be also a little a
little bit swayed by another car in this
price range that I'm reviewing that has
insanely good speakers so maybe take
this with a grain of salt but these
speakers are just okay they're fine
nothing to write home about but they
work um having a sunroof always a nice
plus I like that you can close it too
with a shade um and I I just generally
think it feels more Airy when you have
that sort of space and then I'll show
you the back seat cuz it's a really nice
space also it's going to ask me to hit
that power button every time but there's
really good leg room back here in the
ZDX so let's pop that door and this is
behind the 63 driving position and that
is plenty of space which is good to see
you also have some controls back here
for your vents up or down you can go
Auto you can change from heat and cool
to USBC and fulls sizee Outlet which is
really nice so you know you live with
the car and you find that maybe you've
only used that fulls sizee Outlet once
or once in a while or maybe you only
fold these seats down to put something
huge in the back once in a while or
maybe you only have the sun glaring in
your face once in a while but you have
this little net thing which a lot of
these cars have now why is this phone so
zoomed in all of a sudden um but it's
there in case you need it so well
equipped car that's not missing anything
great and then you get to the way it
drives and because it's a type S and one
of the criteria I mentioned earlier was
being kind of sporty God that's such a
nice color um it is kind of sporty it
does have the 500 horsepower we talked
about and it does have this this pretty
soft suspension this air suspension that
to me does a good job of riding nicely
and comfortably without being floaty so
it is quick it's got plenty of
acceleration don't let the 0 to 60
number fool you I don't know what the
number is off the top of my head but
it's not something something amazing but
it is very torky and quick kind of like
the has been so this thing is really
nice to drive it's sporty it's stable
it's on big wheels and you'd hardly
notice this thing rides so nice so alt
together as a package this one's really
good I just wish it had more range I
just wish I could maybe road trip it
once in a while if I really felt like it
but I don't think I would I don't think
with 275 miles of range and 190 Kow
charging that I would want a road trip
in the ZDX type best last thing I'll
comment on though is the software cuz I
think this will this will be the last
Difference Maker when you're choosing
between this and maybe some other cars
and I think this software in general my
take is it's pretty simple but at least
it's easy to navigate and I think I
reference BMW software a lot because
it's kind of like it's on the other side
of the spectrum there's a ton of
settings but it's also a little harder
to navigate this one this is basically
all the settings you need if you jump in
the Play Store and add apps they'll get
added here on subsequent pages and then
you can see it has carplay and Android
auto Wireless but if you want to just
move these around you can move them
around wherever you want like this is
customizable and so you sort of just put
the things you want to touch the most
often closest to you cuz it's harder to
reach the stuff over here um and that's
kind of it like this this is basically
all the settings for the whole car right
here for the memory of the things it
remembers about you notifications show
up at the top like a phone if you want
to pair your phone that's in Bluetooth
if you want multi multi panel stuff you
can go Google Maps here but you can go
multi pane with the cars content so it's
fine it's responsive it works the one
pedal driving is always at the top for
some reason fine I know where to find it
but in general my summary of this ZDX
Type S is very
livable and a really nice color I really
like this color this tiger eye I I think
again in this segment there is a ton a
ton of choices now I remember talking
about this not that long ago but at
first there were only so many EVS so
they all kind of got compared to each
other now in the in the category of like
utility basic Crossovers and SUVs
there's a bunch of electric options
stay tuned for the next review it's
another one of these that has a very
different pros and cons list but the
question is would you pick this for the
75 grand to do the basic stuff the
groceries the kid hauling the Comfort
driving the occasional sporty stuff let
me know also more cars of this color
please I like it catch you later peace"

honestly and I don't know where to start
type situation with this thing the
number one thing that's uh top of mind
when reviewing this EV is that you can't
actually buy it here in the US it's a
Lee Auto and they don't ship cars here
yet but if they did I think they could
crush uh because this thing has the most
features the most tech I think I've ever
seen or experienced in an EV it's got
some of the craziest most impressive
stuff it's there's just a lot going on
and all for uh kind of an unknown price
because they don't exist here but we got
to take a look at this thing this thing
has been a hit in Whole Food parking
lots it's been a hit around town an
eye-catcher it's the Lee Auto Mega and I
let's just jump right in so look at this
thing this is a fully electric three row
minivan it's got about 350 mes of rain
Real World Range it's got this
incredibly Sleek shape which is
obviously pretty futuristic but also
very aerodynamic and that's what helps
it get that great range and then it
happens to be this is just totally side
note it happens to be basically the
fastest charging EV in the world they're
claiming and I haven't been able to do
this on any charge in the US but they're
claiming 500 plus kilowatt of charging
uh 10 to 80% in 10 minutes something
crazy like that so that's awesome uh but
then there's a whole bunch of tech
Associated inside right you get to the
front so this isn't actually a front
trunk it kind of looks like it could be
but this is a nice bar light at the
front here uninterrupted it's called the
Halo it's kind of their signature look
and then yeah it's got this it's got
this Jetson's look to it this is like I
said it's kind of a hit a lot of people
were wondering like what is that thing
what is that big sloped vehicle so I
think there's safely three themes with
this car one of them would be Simplicity
one of them would be luxury and one of
them would be
family which sounds like a movie
reference but it's not it's you're going
to see what I mean in a second by the
way that's the light bar on so you can
see pretty obvious looking on the road
but you know okay on the outside
obviously it's super simple super smooth
lines just the lar at the top that
sensor is what's going to be Auto Park
and adaptive cruise control and then you
got the real headlights down there and
these big thick Michelin tires this
whole thing is riding on what they're
calling the Magic Carpet air suspension
and I'm not
exaggerating I think it's the softest
best riding air suspension I've ever
driven I'm I'm thinking of things like
the Rolls-Royce Spectre the mybach it's
super super isolating from the road and
you feel like you're kind of just
coasting along in this big bubble but
yeah it's shout out to the Magic Carpet
air suspension really really impressive
but then of course you know you get to
the side you got to be aerodynamic right
so you've got the these mirrors popping
out here and the door handle did pop out
but it's flush to the vehicle when it's
locked that's a side view camera and
then these don't even pop out that's
just a button to open the second row
which I'll get to don't worry you've got
this cap here which I can actually just
pop out like that and that's your
charger in the US again different
charging standards but that all still
works and then it's got this big
dramatic slope here at the bottom and
this big bar tail light I kind of like
that again more cameras on the back so
simple very simple design but I'm going
to start off by getting in the front row
for you because this is where you start
to see the other themes of luxury and
family so driver's
seat this okay let's again there's a lot
now whenever I try to review something
whenever anyone tries to review
something the price is always kind of in
the back of your head as you go through
it it's harder with this because this
isn't shipping here and you know
importing one and trying to take the
equivalent price that's not really
theice PR you'd get it for but just to
give you a ballpark idea this would
translate to like $60 to $80,000 range
roughly to get one of these um that's
pretty great and when you go through all
the features in this vehicle it seems
even more impressive right so I'm
sitting in the driver's seat there's
your steering wheel it's heated these
seats are super comfortable and they've
got these extra cushy pillows which I'm
always a fan of but these are also
heated ventilated and massaging front
seats and then in general it's not too
complicated as far as like getting into
using it there are two 3K OLED touch
screens here that are pretty dang
responsive if you ask me I mean not a
lot of cars are more responsive than
this um the thing about living with this
is a lot of it is in uh well be careful
of bumping the
screen okay so there's your first hint
um a lot of it is in Chinese and a lot
of it is in kilometers and in uh units
and they're not connected to uh networks
here in the US so it doesn't really know
the maps here it doesn't really know
things that it's supposed to so like I
can't actually load up any of these
shows but that's these are all movies
and things on TV so you can watch if
you're sitting here in this seat on this
OLED screen which is pretty cool if I
also ever get my head too close to this
back seat screen it like warns me with
the GPT powered assistant which again I
can't really use because it's it's not
really English but it knows when you get
too close to that screen okay so again
front seat there is no screen right
behind the steering wheel but you may
notice there is an HUD oh that actually
focused that's amazing and there's also
a screen on the steering wheel which
gives you your remaining range which
again that's the wltc standard so it's a
little bit off but something like 350
miles total range you can also change
your drive modes I probably have to be
on let me put my foot on the brick there
you go ready and drive modes I'm in
sport right now uh so you can see stuff
like that uh all the time when you're
driving so I don't really find that I
need another screen behind the steering
wheel and the rest of the stuff is over
here kind of like a Tesla anytime you
want to jump into something like your
cameras or your navigation which isn't
going to load all the way but you get
the idea it's all always there which is
pretty sweet also if you're doing the
self-driving stuff it also appears on
here as well so there you go really
responsive software well done but when I
say family is the other theme you think
of like um like a full family of like
six or I mean this is seven seats 1 2 3
4 5 6 7even and there's like three
generations of people in here there's
the parents the grandparents and the
babies and they all need to be able to
use this and live with this fairly
easily it kind of ties into the
Simplicity of it big obvious door handle
right a shelf for storage above some
more storage every single speaker is
circular and really obvious the air
vents are really simple like nothing too
crazy and then also just bursting with
tech this is the key fob it drops right
here two 50 W wireless chargers in the
front simple cup holders here then again
some more USB type-c which is power but
then also recording which is that's a
flash drive for your Sentry mode and
your dash cam because these cameras are
good enough to actually do that so if
someone comes up to the car while you're
away they get some nice HD footage of
them on your your card which is great um
gosh there's so much I'm just in the
front seat going over all this stuff
there's 21 speakers in this car and it
has Dolby atmo support the speakers
sound pretty good but there's also just
all these extra modes of like things you
can adjust in the speakers uh it gave me
EQ settings I'm going to have a hard
time finding it now because there were
so many here's tun Master uh all these
presets which I couldn't read but I
would poke around and change the set and
I would hear the difference there is a
lot going on with customization of the
audio well just that was awesome to me
um temperature controls in Celsius I
mean none of this stuff is going to
shock you if you own a car outside of
the US but yeah a lot a lot of really
good stuff going on here lighting sport
mode there's the drive modes again it's
crazy that's just the front seat that's
just that's just the front seat but you
already know this is feeling like a
speed tour we got to get to the second
row because there's way more to talk
about so press that little button right
there again it's still flush you don't
need any moving parts that big minivan
style door slides open and you've got
your second row which is these big
jetliner executive style seats we'll get
to that third row in a second but these
are heated cooled and massaging again
they've got this calf rest they've moved
forward and backward a lot and you sit
down and you've got yourself like I mean
seven series type leg room this is
incred I mean over here it's even more
there's a ton of leg room here and then
I'm going to close it actually with this
little switch right here and you got
this huge screen up here another OLED
and there's also a sensor right here
which actually does a lot so you can
close it if you want or open it but this
second row experience is kind of where
you want to be again big cushy like
comfortable nice like seats to be in
there's your two cup holders in the
middle if you want them there and then
okay couple important things one all
your age pack controls are here two this
is a refrigerator SL heater so right now
it's got the refrigeration going and
it's cool these drinks and they are ice
cold which is awesome but they can also
heat which is is literally a family
thing like if you have baby formula or
like drinks or little things you want to
keep warm you can do that in here um
also this vehicle's kind of a hit people
are like what is that thing I got to
stop and check it out I got to look at
it but the last thing is the screen up
here is gesture controlled so I guess
the only way to show you how this works
is
basically uh I hold my hand on the
armrest like this and a little cursor
dot appears on that touchcreen and I
move my hand
around and it is moving yeah you can see
that it's moving around and I can just
drag stuff over like this
and I can watch again these are tons of
shows and there's no internet connection
so it's not going to work right now but
all of that gesture control works I can
even grab something and throw it onto
the uh front co-pilot display and it's
going to say no internet but the fact
that I can do that at all is kind of
sick so this whole entertainment system
back here is very Advanced oh and don't
forget two more personal 50 W wireless
chargers for your phone okay we have
even made it to third row let's let's
move back to the third row this is this
is getting crazy now there's a little
bit of a shimmy to get back here because
these two jetliner seats are so uh close
together that that's the only Corridor
you have unless you fullon move these
seats up but then you get to the back
and with that crazy leg room you just
saw I can sit behind that seat and I
still have decent leg room that's like
five series type leg room if you want to
spread everybody out these are also
heated seats there's also us spe type c
if you want it and cup holders and a
little bit more speaker stuff going on
back here so this is a pretty solid
third row I would say not even close to
like the rivian r1s we just had on the
channel is like a very very cramped two
seats in the back this is a very fair
like this is the second row of the rivan
but it's the third row of the mega but
I'm going to end this little interior
tour actually by getting back to the
second row careful of bumping the
screen sorry I keep it keep is telling
me I'm close to the screen and you're
right sorry I shouldn't be quite so
close um but there's something in this
this second row called nap mode so if
you think of this as like a family
vehicle that's almost like a a mobile
home and you feel like you can nap in it
at any time I almost forgot to mention
that you can put those Shades up um so
you can turn on Nap mode and just take a
nap in here which is just two Taps away
you hit nap mode and you go yeah let's
take a 10minute nap and if you even want
you can add some sounds you could do
totally silent or you could just do uh
something like Forest hit enable
nap right away this starts closing up
top the seats in front start moving
forward my seats reclining the calf rest
is coming up and I am
suddenly much more
likely to take a nap I don't know if you
hear that but it's playing this very
Serene uh Forest sound
it's also a little countdown clim timer
to my f minute nap that's that's sick I
mean this is the the stuff that you saw
remember the BMW i7 I'm going to end the
nap actually but the BMW i7 had this
like super reclin mode like if this is
some type of uber it would be the
greatest thing ever there's so many
things about this car and there's even
more that I haven't even pointed out
that are pretty sick they are absolutely
incredible all these things would be
like thousands of dollars of options on
basically any other EV any other car car
that I review but they're all part of
the mega this Flagship vehicle for them
uh I think that's pretty sick now fun
fact if you like a lot of this interior
a lot of these features these screens
the roof and the seats and everything
that I've been talking about but you
don't want the shape of what the leato
mega is well they also have a little
something called the L9 which is
actually more of their more reasonable
SL attainable
FL this is their real Flagship I would
say this is the same thing the same
three rows but in the shape of a more
traditional SUV and uh I like it a lot
to be honest it's it's a little less
futuristic looking it still has that bar
that we talked about but it's more
integrated into the shape of the front
of the thing but I think what's more
important is this one is actually a
hybrid it doesn't actually run from the
gas directly to the wheels it's always
driving via EV Power but the gas engine
oh but the gas engine is being used to
power and charge back up the battery so
you're actually always driving the same
way always quietly on EV Power but the
gas engine gives you that constant peace
of mind that if you can find a gas
station and fill up with gas you can
immediately start driving again which is
pretty sick it is always typically
pretty silent there is sometimes though
a little bit of a hum that you can hear
of the gas engine running uh so that is
the the main difference is there is a
gas tank and there is a little bit of
space taken up for that in the L9 but if
you're not about the mega if you're not
about the full EV thing then you can get
that peace of mind here in that sort of
hybrid system and I think a lot of
people will actually make that choice so
here's my question to you I actually
want to know what you think in the
comment section if if you saw this
driving around and you realize that you
could get one um over the other options
let's just let's just put this at
$80,000 let's say it's 80 grand would
you pick this over the other $80,000
options over the model X over an r1s
that you could get for that much money
there's a lot of things that I really
like with three rows that are very
practical and very fun and electric and
this makes a case for being one of the
best ones between the suspension and the
second row luxury and the Practical
Simplicity and the HD and the way it
rides I mean I'm I'm very impressed so
I'm I'm curious if you would actually
pick one of these if you could get your
hands on one let me know all right
thanks for watching catch you in the
next one peace"

channel this is essentially the top dog
of the 5 series lineup and it's been a
bit controversial because it's now a
hybrid with the V8 motor and it now
weighs over 5,300 lb which you know is
pretty heavy and just to get the whole
weight thing out of the way I truly
believe that 99% of people who buy these
cars are not taking them to the tracks
and they're not going down twisty back
roads every single week and so the
weight for a lot of people isn't going
to be in issue so I don't really think
that's something to necessarily focus on
although it is certainly a noticeable
Factor when talking about actual driving
in performance that we'll get into a
little bit later but as far as the looks
go I think it's very much still an M5 in
the sense that it's pretty subtle but if
you're noticing certain details like the
the widen fenders and the very
aggressive front end it's still you know
if you know you know type of car where
the average person is not going to
really bat an eye at this but if you
know what the M5 is you know you have
the things like Defender flares in the
aggressive front end to kind of point
out that this is the flagship model I
think it's a good look car honestly some
people are not on board with it I think
it looks perfectly fine as far as things
that make it look different from the I5
M60 aesthetically obviously the front
bumper has a slightly different design
but you still have that illuminated
kidney Grill hopping over to the side we
have these massive carbon ceramic brakes
which you cannot get on an i5 M60 you
know some meteor tires there and then
you can check out the Hoff Kink that now
has the M5 logo as opposed to just the 5
series logo on the I5 and check out this
paint it might be hard to tell and
especially cuz it's a rainy dreary day
but in the sunlight you have this like
really sick gold reflection in this
purple paint which is pretty cool you're
definitely not going to be able to get a
paint option like this on the I5 M60 at
least as far as I know and it'd be silly
to not point out the fact that right
here is your port to plug in the M5 and
charge it because it's not only a hybrid
but a plug-in hybrid and so we'll talk
about the electric experience a little
bit later but then another signature
Flagship M feature is the full carbon
roof which is going to lower your center
of gravity shape some weight up at the
top and uh give the car a more
aggressive sporty feel compared to the
I5 M60 but then taking a look out back
you have your quad exhaust tips which
has been on every BMW M5 since day one
it's just a signature feature and you of
course you know make a good amount of
Noise with this thing with the V8 mode
but let's talk General practicality with
the M5 it's essentially the same as the
I5 the trunk is actually decently sized
it's not massive there is a touring
version of this car that I wasn't able
to drive today but that will offer you a
bit more room in the back compared to
the sedan version but this is a good
amount of space right here I'll put the
actual amount of cubic feet right here
in the corner but this is usable you
could fit definitely a good amount of
luggage in here if you're road tripping
with your kids
this is a solid amount of storage
unfortunately there's no under storage
area right here but I think this amount
is plenty usable but with that out of
the way let's talk about interior
technology livability with the M5
there's not much that's going to be
different compared to the I5 M60 and
other variants of the 5 series but there
are a few specific M features that I
want to point out that are important to
note here I actually just move the car
to get a little bit more light in the
interior so the main thing to notice
here is that you're going to have your
M1 and your M2 buttons these are your
configurable M mode so the typically the
way people do it is you have M1 which is
going to be for your most sporty
performance oriented mode and then M2
might be for a bit more relaxed
performance mode where you might only
have the drivetrain in sport but then
everything else suspension and things
like that are in Comfort mode and you
can activate that by hitting the setup
menu and then it will take you here on
the big screen where you can access the
M1 and M2 configurations where you can
access Drive Logic the transmission
control which will you know uh adjust
the aggressiveness of the shifts the
chassis which will adjust suspension and
general comfort and dampening the
steering which will adjust how heavy the
steering is and then how aggressive the
brakes are with the braking DSC off can
also uh allow for a little bit more tail
spinning if that's something you're into
but a really cool feature that is so
awesome about these X Drive BMWs is that
if you turn DSC off you can access the M
Drive settings which allows you to turn
this into a rear wheeel drive car so you
hit two wheel drive and then you have a
rear wheel drive M5 just like the old
one so you can kind of have your Kagan
eat it too with these X Drive BMWs and
that's like one of my favorite features
about having X Drive in a BMW model I
know the iDrive experience in modern
BMWs is one that's pretty much either
loved or hated to me I'm somewhere in
the middle I at I think it's just fine
but from a functionality standpoint I
think they've made Solid improvements
with the latest version having the
climate controls be on the bottom so you
don't have to go hunting for a lot of
the basic climate controls things like
that it's smooth it's fluid it kind of
just works most of the time I just boot
up Apple carplay and that's kind of the
world I live in I usually don't mess
around with the actual iDrive UI stuff
90% of the time so I think it's a solid
infotainment to live with and we've
obviously gone over the new High Drive a
handful of times at this point with the
other BMWs we reviewed on this channel
but for me it's still perfectly fine but
build quality fit and finish all of it
is on par with what you would expect for
a 5 series lots of nice materials here
you have the the cool grills for the
speakers the Bowser and wilin speakers
that actually sound pretty good you have
these illuminated LEDs here that can
change color depending on the drive mode
that you're in you of course have Apple
carplay and Android auto support on this
primary display right here our seats are
heated cooled and you have a heated
steering wheel which works very well and
which has been very helpful on this very
cold day outside the seat Comfort itself
is actually really good compared to the
I5 M60 these are actually very
supportive but yet very comfortable to
sit in for long stance of time I've
probably done about 100 miles in this
car and it's been very comfortable the
whole way through you have your two
wireless charging pads which you know
aren't great BMW isn't known for having
really great Wireless charges most of
the time it barely charges your phone
but then just Cooks it to a billion
degre you have two USBC ports right here
you have a little center console storage
right here with no USB storage but I
mean you can fit a few items in there as
you can see and then you have some cup
holder spots down here two cup holders
right here very standard stuff for what
you would expect from a five series
plenty of uh nice things as optioned a
lot more uh spacious and storage
oriented than what you would get in a
three series or four series but let's
actually take a look at the back of the
car just to get a general sense of what
it's like to be in the back there is one
new thing I want to point out so it is
cool to see these new M5 seats from the
back and we of course have the USBC
ports just like you have in the I5 of
course the massive bows and Wilkins
mid-range drivers with the illuminated
LEDs that's pretty sick it's pretty
comfortable back here it's not the most
spacious sedan ever but this is
certainly usable at least for the two
left and right seats the middle seat is
always going to be a bit of a struggle
because you have you know the drive
shaft transmission tunnel right there so
if you're middle seat is probably not
going to be a fun time but sitting back
here in the back it's decently
comfortable sitting behind my driving
position which is not 63 like Marquez
but I have enough room I have plenty of
room actually and you could probably
move the seat back at least enough
another 3 or 4 in before I'd be
uncomfortable you of course have the uh
what Doug De Mir likes to call the
peasant blocker window shades right here
which is a nice luxury touch also found
on other versions of the 5 series but
the big thing let me just turn on some
lights so you can
see the big thing to note here is that
you now have this new kind of a LED
touch capacitive display for the rear
seats which is not something you have on
the I5 and you can hit that to enable
your heated seats you can use this to
mess with the AC right here so that's
useful to have and it looks a little bit
more modern and Sleek than what you have
in other versions of the 5 series and in
the 3 Series and four series you have
your two USBC ports right here which is
very useful to have and that's pretty
much it for the back seat it's a it's a
decently nice place to be in I think
it's plenty comfortable especially if
this is where your kids are going to be
most of the time if you're taking them
to school and things like that it's it's
solid but let's really get into how this
car drives because that's what
everyone's been talking about with this
new M5 how does this thing actually
drive so I think it's fitting that we
start off the driving in electric mode
because this is a hybrid after all that
actually has some usable electric range
so you have a 14.8 KW hour battery pack
which gives you about
25ish miles
in the real world if you were like
really really granny driving maybe you
could achieve a little bit over 30 but
25 is like the realistic number for Ev
driving but it's not just about giving
you electric only range even though
that's a benefit for emissions and
making this thing usable in certain
cities in Europe where they don't allow
high performance gas powered cars but it
is a benefit in the performance sector
as well so between the wind turbo V8
that's been in the M5 for a while now
and the electric motor and battery pack
you've got 717 Hors power and 738 lb
feet of torque which I mean that's a
huge number and a pretty significant
jump from the previous M5 that only had
about 620 horsepower so it's one of the
bigger jumps between M5 Generations in
power but the asterisk there is that
because the car weighs so much more it
almost is exactly the same in terms of
pure acceleration and aggressiveness but
let's pop it into M1
mode and then you might be able to hear
the engine kick on there it's ring
outside so I'm not going to do any
intense Highway poles or anything like
that but in general this car is not slow
at all I did a timed test on a close
circuit 0 to 60 in
3.4 seconds so I mean that's technically
slower than the last generation Top Dog
M5 CS but that's still a very quick car
generally speaking and even without
doing a launch control just doing a Full
Throttle pull from a dig it's one of the
quickest feeling BMWs and quickest
feeling sedans I've ever experienced
because of the hybrid setup there are
some quirky transmission tuning issues
that I also experienced in the XM which
essentially has the same plug-in hybrid
setup uh that makes it a little jerky on
certain acceleration ation when manual
shifting but from a pure acceleration
and speed standpoint everything you need
is there this car is more than fast
enough for what an M5 owner or M owner
would expect to experience and when you
really boil it down to what the M5 is
supposed to be it's not about doing you
know track days and you know doing
intense back road driving and things
like that like I mentioned at the
beginning of the video this car was
initially intended to just do high-speed
Autobon cruising in comfort and when
you're not in the M performance mode and
you have it in Comfort mode and you're
just chilling out it's one of the most
comfortable M cars of the modern era
that I've ever driven it's extremely
comfortable to drive suspension is so
much smoother than what you have in the
M2 M3 and M4 it's just a really truly
livable M car I like to say that all of
the new M cars can be used as daily
driver sedans but this is truly one that
you could comfortably Drive every day
and won't beat you up so if there's
anything that's been improved with this
new M5 objectively that's the Comfort
levels because it is a really
comfortable car to drive can you
certainly feel the weight when taking
this car into corners and bends
absolutely without any question it feels
like a heavy car but for someone who's
into cars but not a hardcore Enthusiast
who grew up driving lotuses and Miatas
and Cayman and things like that I don't
think it's something that a lot of
people are going to care about which is
why I honestly think they'll probably do
well selling these new m5s just because
it delivers all the same things that the
M5 fundamentally is opposed to do high
speed high performance it is capable in
the corners despite you feeling the
weight it never is overcome by the
weight and any situation I put it in
dynamically it's been able to handle but
you can obviously feel that mass and
from a practicality standpoint it's a
more usable M5 than what you had before
because you have now 25 M of EV only
range and it's obviously going to be
noticeably more fuel efficient overall
because you have this hybrid setup than
the last gen M5 and you still get the V8
you get all the cool V8 sounds that you
want it's not super loud and Rowdy as
the other generation of the M5 were but
you can still hear it and still
appreciate that V8 sound so really this
car is still doing everything that the
M5 is supposed to do fundamentally
highspeed autobond capable cruising in
Comfort with luxury features the heated
ventilated seats you have great Bowers
and Wilkins speakers in here it's doing
all that stuff pretty well and so when
you get over all the 5400 lb humbug it's
still a pretty great daily driver in
very capable from a performance
standpoint for the street no one who's
going to buy an M5 even the last gen M5
it was likely going to take it to a
track anyway it was to have a nice cool
luxury sedan that was fast on the RO and
that's exactly what this new M5 does
despite it being bigger and heavier and
so overall this car gets my
recommendation as a performance car
would I personally buy one probably not
but I feel like for someone who just
wants a nice luxury performance car the
M5 still does everything that you want
it to do and so for that reason it gets
a recommendation for me but let me know
what you guys think about this new M5 in
the comments Down Below have they ruined
it is the weight too much is it being a
hybrid something that makes you not
consider it at all should they have just
made the new M5 completely electric
instead let me know your thoughts in the
comments down below and subscribe to the

thanks for watching and I'll talk to you

motoring experiences I've ever had
personally was back when I was daily
driving at Tesla I got to drive and
borrow the original the Tesla Roadster
from
2008 and got to really feel the
beginning and the experience of what
original electric sports car was
supposed to be and then obviously see
the evolution that happened since then
now you know I'm daily driving 911 and
the question I may have had is what
would an equivalent throwback experience
be and this one it's actually not
exactly what it looks like because
you're probably thinking oh you're going
to drive a a manual OG turbo that's a
crazy car to drive no no no no no this
one this one's electric so for the past
couple days miles and I have had a real
treat driving around this thing this is
a a sort of remodeled 964 generation
Porche 9911 to be fully electric by a
company called sacr Motors probably
appropriately named because there's
plenty of people who see this and see
electric and that feels sacrilegious but
then you see the reviews and what people
have thought about driving this thing
and seems like they've done an
incredible job so I just wanted to check
it out and see how this actually drove
and it turns out it's an incredible
combination of the manual original feel
with this obviously new powertrain being
well I'll say it better than the
original now if you go back and watch
that original living with the 2008 Tesla
Roadster video uh you'll see I mean it's
it's quite a throwback from the Teslas
of today the screens are much smaller
the car is much smaller the battery is
much smaller and everything is just
further behind it's more analog but not
completely this generation car first
came out in the80s is a 1989 model and
so there were no screens this is even
more of a throwback and so you might
think living with it would be crazy and
then taking one of these rare cars and
going through the work of turning it
into an electric car is just a crazy
idea but after I've lived with it now I
actually get why people do it and there
may be some surprises in uh in my
experience that I'll share with you now
so let's just jump right in so first of
all gorgeous car I might be biased
because I'm obviously I chose a car
that's inspired heavily by this and I
actually have a black one too but you
can see this is the widebody one
and it's a convertible as well so
Cabriolet if you want to call it that
and the thing to note here that's kind
of interesting is there there's a lot of
parts here that are shared from the
original Porsche Parts but also a lot of
new parts like you can see these wheels
here you also see these new Brembo
brakes that barely fit underneath the
wheels but they get in there pilot sport
tires that barely fit under the fenders
and these are some big wide tires back
here too matter of fact what can I see
these are 295 section 18-in rim
these are some juicy tires back here for
the amount of power this thing puts out
which is 5 horsepower and 500 newon met
now it's electric so a lot of the cars
built today have the batteries in like
this little skateboard underneath the
car but where's the battery in here
there's actually two big one in the
front and big one in the back
so on the off chance that you're doing a
road trip or something in this car you
do have a little bit of front trunk
space not a huge amount but enough for
an adapter maybe a bag carryon size bag
or so but that's half the battery right
there below that carpeting also your
adjustable dampers and I I think that's
uh your windshield wiper fluid so
there's where half the weight goes
so behind this iconic duct tail where
the old power plant used to be there's
the other half of the battery and of
course your dampers as well but that is
a whole bunch of weight so now you can
see it's kind of evenly distributed
there's no more storage in here but
there's half the battery in the front
half the battery in the back and in
total that's going to get you around 200
mil of of range on a single charge if
you drive it like normal which is
actually kind of impressive because of
how small this car really is I mean you
don't expect a whole bunch of space to
put battery in but since the battery is
not on the floor that means the driving
position and all this interior is closer
than ever to the original these are new
seats but then of course when I get in
here you're going to see a whole bunch
of original Porsche so I remember when I
made that video on the refreshed
Volkswagen bus the electric one the ID
Buzz there was a lot of comments that
were like this is kind of cool I guess
but I wish they just took the exact old
retro design and they just made that one
electric and I totally get it now
because that's basically what this car
is I am surrounded by analog Parts not a
single screen in sight well actually
they've given me a little tiny screen
here for carplay and and it's barely it
barely counts as a screen cuz this is
added extra but when you're driving
you're focused here on this wheel and on
this beautiful interior which is
basically just your gauges now you saw
that key from before this is the way to
turn the car on Stick the key right in
there turn
it and you see these gauges spin up so
the gauges are of course updated a bit
to work with the electric nature of this
car so it's telling me my battery level
it's also going to tell me which drive
mode I'm in how much power I'm using
Great Sound uh you can see how much
range I have left I'm in chill mode
right now and over there is my speed so
this is an updated gauge cluster but
very much analog you've got your parking
brake down here this is I'll put foot on
the brake reverse drive neutral and
they've actually added a MAG safe Puck
with power just to charge your mag safe
devices
so if you do want carplay if you don't
want to put iPhone there that is a nice
little touch that they've added even
though the entire rest of this car is
super retro you can have your brand new
phone charging right there where it
belongs but yeah oh my God every single
little thing happening here is such a
throwback the air conditioning these
notches here for cooling and heating for
where the air comes out obviously all
manual events we're not doing any
screens for that type of stuff and of
course you have your lock here and the
way you open the door is just this
little thing right here this is sick I'm
loving it now there's a couple other
buttons over here that you do want to
know about specifically this one with an
exclamation point on it which switches
the car from chill mode hold on it says
crank me because it wants me to fully
turn it
on from chill mode to sport mode and the
thing about these cars is they are so
kind of custom and like oneoff built
that you know there is Chill mode which
is is more regen uh 65% regen and a you
know 2/3 3/4 of the power but they can
tailor it when they build you the car to
be exactly the way you want sport mode
has less regen closer to 20% regen uh
but is giving you all of the Power again
all of that can be customized but it's
just crazy to me to sit in a car like
this knowing that cars used to be so
small that you could reach over and just
touch the other side without fully
extending your arm cars used to be so
much smaller so much
thinner there's no airbag in this car
but you've got your windshield wipers
here you've got your blinkers over here
things are all still in the familiar
places but it's just such a throwback
it's so sick this is this is a
one-of-a-kind experience you also have
your back seats don't forget about those
my car has the same thing barely usable
you don't want an adult back there but
you could do it if you want to but I'm
going to pass it to miles for the
Driving Experience cuz I've shown you
the interior I've shown you the basics
you get 200 miles of driving so Miles
what's it like to drive the brand of
this car is sacrilege Motors because the
idea to a lot of uh OG Porsche
enthusiasts that someone would take a
car like this and put electric motors
inside is kind of crazy right and I
think there's this big problem with the
car Community where people think it just
has to be one or the other for certain
types of vehicles people are upset that
the new Ferrari hyper car has a V6
instead of a V12 but if you can afford
that car what's stopping you from owning
12 other cars with a V12 you should look
at this car the same way if you have
nearly $800,000 or more to spend on a
car like this what's also stopping you
from spending the equivalent money on a
classic ice Porsche 911 and so with all
that in mind I think it's important that
we don't try to compare this to an ice
911 because if you can afford this car
you can also just get an internal
combustion engine 964 but what I will
say is that what they've done an amazing
job at with this car is making sure the
only thing that doesn't feel like a 9911
is the fact that you have electric
motors for the drivetrain literally
every other aspect of driving this car
even down to the
smells is definitely what you would
experience with a classic Porsche 911
the steering feel it's nice weighted
connected super communicative takes a
bit of elbow work to get it going just
like a classic torche from the 9s 80s
it's obviously super low to the ground
it's very stiff because of those
three-way adjustable coilovers that
we'll talk about a little bit later and
then the lightness this car only weighs
just barely over 3,000 lb which makes
this lighter than most gas powered cars
currently on sale today we also still
have the 4060 weight distribution of a
traditional 911 so weight transfer
General balance and handling it's all on
par with the original car but then of
course you've got
500
horsepower just a little over 500 Newt
meters of torque I'll put the conversion
here at a pound
feet and so 3,000 lb 500 horsepower
and rear wheeel drive
only this thing is quick and it's uh
it's quite frankly a little scary at
times just because of how small it is it
certainly has that OG car feel just like
other cars we've had on the channel this
year like the Volkswagen ID Buzz older
cars like that really make you feel like
yeah if you uh if you screw up in this
thing there's not a lot that's going to
save you but that's a part of the fun
with cars like these these older
Porsches these older purpose-built
sports cars the lack of safety in a
sense is almost what adds to The Thrill
of the experience and so in this car
there are zero nannies you have no
traction control system so you turn the
wheel to the left and floor it and you
are going sideways the suspension on
this car is actually really interesting
firstly I'm sure you've noticed in this
footage that it is pretty stiff uh it
sits very low and so you're going to
feel a lot of those bumps but it's
certainly liveable depending on who you
are I guess and the area you live in I
live in New Jersey so obviously ride
Comfort is going to always not be the
best compared to other places but it is
adjustable and that's because these are
three-way adjustable coilovers made by
Pensky racing and they're known for
making setups for like you know
supercars sports cars and so what this
setup is is very similar to something
that You' get in like a GT3 RS for
example one of the killer parts of this
setup is having remote reservoirs that
you can see by opening the rear hatch of
the car and so you have these remote
reservoirs that are connected to the
primary fluid tank uh underneath the car
via these hydraulic lines that are
feeding fluid back and forth and so the
benefits you're getting is firstly
maintenance it's easier to access those
reservoirs by just popping over the rear
hatch but then secondly you're getting
Easy adjustability by just opening the
rear hatch and adjusting the knobs
connected to the reservoir which makes
it super super easy to tailor your
Driving Experience to whatever scenario
you're in this is not necessarily
designed to be a super high performance
track vehicle but because of this setup
and the weight and the power you
certainly could take this to a track day
and probably embarrass a lot of folks
and so overall you're working with ride
Comfort that's not only better than what
you would get from an original 964 but
more adjustable and more capable as well
you're also working with a very healthy
brake set set up in this car you've got
six piston calipers up front four piston
calipers in the rear big steel Brembo
rotors all around and so a setup like
that is what you'd find on a lot of like
high-end super cars from like the past
10 years or so but the braking
modulation is also really nice it's not
super grabby and stabby like a lot of
sports cars are known to be it's very
smooth and gradual which makes it a lot
easier to live with as a daily driver if
that's something you wanted to attempt
to do so like I mentioned at the
beginning I don't think it makes sense
to try to compare this as an alternative
to the equivalent 911 from this era but
even with that in mind I do think we
should evaluate the fun Factor versus a
911 of this era not powered by electric
motors and a battery I think it really
depends on who you are for some people
not having that noise is just not going
to do anything for you no matter how
scary and how capable the car is
overall to me this is something I think
I would love to buy for someone who
wants the feeling of driving a 911
without having to deal with all of the
uh maintenance responsibilities that
come with maintaining a 911 from this
era you know when getting a car like
this you're not going to have to deal
with that sort of stuff and I think it's
also an interesting challenge to try to
learn and stand a car with this type of
instantaneous power delivery without any
of the electronic traction control
assists and all that fun stuff it's
certainly different than learning to
understand a manual transmission 993
turbo where you have to properly timed
shifts and throttle input with you know
the Boost of the turbos if you have a
turbocharge 911 that sort of stuff it's
certainly an entirely different
experience one that you can't just
compare directly to an internal
combustion engine powered 911 I think
it's pretty hard to not have fun in a
car like this even if you would prefer
having you know an 8,000 RPM high
revving you know manual transmission
experience this is not a replacement for
that but if you have a budget that
allows for it I think it's a pretty cool
addition and it's something that I think
a lot of people are going to be
naturally very skeptical about but but I
think it's only right that you give it a
try before ruling it out when you have
all these things when you have the
Porsche Media Center you have the
Porsche steering field you have the
Porsche smell it smells like a lot of my
uncle Jim's old Porsches like it's
actually crazy when you put all that
into
consideration you can understand how you
can get to an extremely high price point
because these are handbuilt machines
these are not Tesla Model 3s where you
know you'll see weird gaps here and
there and weird uh quirky
inconsistencies this has that real OG
German car feel which is you know it's
hard to put a price on that for some
people I think I love this thing I think
I love this thing this might be my
favorite car that we've actually got to
test here and it's part the car part The
Experience again I keep throwing back to
that 2008 Tesla Roadster video how far
the technology has come since the
original Tesla Roadster the battery
density how much range you get how fast
they charge um I didn't even show you I
should show you one last thing before I
wrap this up how you charge this is
actually kind of really intuitive you
just grab this and
Pull and this opens and there 's your
charge port right here CCS pop it right
in there like you would expect that to
be a sort of a gas tank but they've
thought of everything but this I love
this just project because it's it's just
such an obviously original OG looking
car from the80s the classic shape I
don't think anyone's ever not likeed the
shape of this 911 but then it just has
what I'm familiar with which is the
electric Driving Experience and kind of
does it really well this is an ultimate
fun car I love it I'll leave a link
below if you want to check them out
probably nobody who actually watches
this is going to go buy one of these but
it's one of the sickest things ever and
I'm glad I got to experience it
hopefully I get to try this
again all right thanks for watching
catch you in the next one peace"

electric cars on this channel and one of
the ones that stood out the most over
the years is the Lucid air because when
I reviewed it I ended up thinking
honestly this this is it this is the
best electric car the peak EV that you
can get over the Tesla Model S that was
my take better engineered better driving
all this stuff more ranged just
fundamentally better and then we
reviewed the sapphire and that thing was
like the Plaid competitor and it
actually beat it in so many ways it was
faster more range better driving better
handling remarkable stuff but the
asterisk with Lucid at least for
reviewing these things to me has always
been they're just expensive they're
always more expensive than what they're
up against and so this is the first time
I've been able to make a much more
interesting comparison because this
behind me here is the cheapest Lucid air
this is the Lucid air pure rear wheel
drive this car comes in starting at the
very base with no options at right
around $770,000 and that is an actually
interesting comparison versus the Tesla
Model S base which is all-wheel drive
but that also starts around $70,000
prices do fluctuate quite a bit but this
now it's no longer like the sapphire
being nearly three times the cost of a
plaid this is a little more apples to
apples and there's a lot of pros and
cons When comparing this Lucid air to
those so so how good is the cheapest
Lucid well before I get into the a Tob
details let me just at least confess one
thing about this car which is okay it
does have one option this is not
actually the cheapest Lucid air pure
this one has the stealth package so it's
a $1,750 option that blacks out all the
trim it blacks out the wheels it blacks
out the mirror caps and what would have
been silver around this car is now black
I it it looks better because of it I
will say but now this is technically not
the cheapest absolute base but
everything else is so we'll we'll go
from there for this car but as far as
Basics like this is a 0 to 60 and 4.3
second car where the base model S will
do it quicker it's about 3.1 seconds but
they both offer about 400 mil of range
they're both a full-size EV sedan two
doors in the front two doors in the back
a frunk a trunk and a lot of space for a
lot of people now getting into the front
details there's I mean I think I've said
over the years I'm not the biggest fan
of the Lucid aesthetic but it has grown
on me and there's something about this
this sort of Storm Trooper visor in
black on the white car it's not bad it's
got this light bar on the front lights
on the side where the blinkers are it's
not a it's not a bad looking car it's
not my favorite but I'm not mad at it
you've got these 19in Arrow Wheels on
the side plli P0 allseason tires they
look totally fine there are upgraded 20s
available I honestly probably wouldn't
get them I'd stick with this the Lucid
key is still this little slender fob
thing here uh it doesn't have as many
issues as we'd had with the air Sapphire
experience that we had earlier this year
um still does have occasional like
hiccups where you have to press it twice
to get in but in general it's pretty
good it's this little small thing and
then once you get in here I'm going to
start first by opening these doors front
door opens almost all the way back door
on the Lucid opens full 90° which is
awesome I believe that's the beginning
of Advantage Lucid um but while we're
here I'll jump in the back seat and the
air has just a little bit more back seat
space if that's what you're concerned
about but it does have a weaker back
seat infotainment experience if that's
what you're concerned about so you can
see the foot room here is pretty nice
although there's a little bit of a hump
with air vents underneath the driver
they actually stack a little bit more
battery there for a little bit more
range but you got some storage here
you've got vents here a little bit more
storage here but the Tesla does have a
bigger screen with a much smaller bezel
to potentially watch videos if you're
into that to potentially do I don't know
web browsing or other things that you
might be interested in I don't think I
would do nearly as much of that on the
back screen but I also am a big fan of
this little latch here to open the Lucid
that they've had since the beginning but
this is also not a soft closing door a
lot of cars in this price range do have
soft clo this one does does not now in
order to get that better back seat
experience the Lucid does have to trade
in the trunk department so the model S
is a full true hatchback while the Lucid
it does have a large trunk but it's not
a hatchback and it's a smaller opening
and you can't fit nearly as tall items
in there not that that's going to affect
most people most of the time you still
have a ton of sub trunk space look at
all that and you still have all this
deep space for multiple golf bags as
many groceries as you could possibly
want it's great but it's not as tall of
an opening and there is less volume so
that is Advantage Tesla just in the
trunk space Department maybe you're
going to road trip a lot now in Lucid of
the past I then would have gone on to
point out that the powered front trunk
is another big advantage of the lucid
and I find that I use a front trunk way
more when it does have a powered opening
but on the Lucid air pure you'll
actually see that if I open the front
trunk it just pops but it's not powered
so it's basically a match one: one with
the Tesla here you have a manually
opening front trunk and it's nice and
softly opening of course a ton of space
in there no complaints very usable but
it's not powered so it's no longer an
advantage over the model S in that
department it's normal front run so just
packaging wise
um maybe leave uh packaging wise and the
way they've set up this car there are
some upsides and some down sides to the
way the Lucid set up again I've walked
right up to the car with it just opened
now uh with the key fob in my pocket
it's not the most responsive thing in
the world but let's just get inside the
Lucid air because then again you have a
new set of upsides or downsides so then
interior quality wise I think this is
closer to a draw than a lot of people
may give Tesla credit for so there's
obviously a pretty big variety of
materials in here they're both pretty
minimal Interiors as far as cars go but
you know you've got this fabric over
here you've got leather up top with this
little piping you've got this gray wood
look down here but there's a lot more
physical controls in a lucid so real
HVAC controls love that you have a
volume knob here you have your fan
control temperature speed fan speed this
this stuff here I really like a lot of
people will that's Advantage Lucid then
you've got storage so okay this is again
coming from someone who's used a Model S
quite a bit this is very similar two cup
holders one wireless charger not two so
technically Advantage Tesla there Tesla
will have two wireless chargers but you
can store your phone in here and you
have coverage storage here and your
armrest which pops up and can store some
more stuff down there a lot of be logos
if you'll notice all over this car but
then secondly and this is not a small
feature for a lot of people there's two
screens obviously this big one behind
the steering wheel and this second
smaller one down here which pops up and
can give you a little more storage but
the feature I'm talking about is that
right there Apple carplay the fact that
lucid caved and does actually allow
carplay not Android auto but Wireless
carplay now in their cars is actually
going to sway a lot of people because
Teslas have not ever and honestly
probably will never cave and allow
carplay or Android auto um
weirdly weirdly I tried to pair my
Android phone first to this car and it
didn't like it at all not even for
Android auto just to pair my Android
phone by a Bluetooth to play music and
it didn't do very well it didn't
actually successfully pair but it paired
with the iPhone just fine something to
note but yes this here is a big reason
why I think a lot of people are more
willing to consider the Lucid air over
the Tesla that said you can still use
the built-in maps and the built-in music
player and all that that is totally up
to you but carplay is available in the
Lucid air now I think Lucid Software
which has looked like this for a while
is pretty good Tesla has excellent
software no matter which spec or which
trim you get it's kind of all the same
and it looks phenomenal this is uh this
is pretty simple smooth Swift or Sprint
are your drive modes but I must say the
ability to change your regen
amount Advantage Lucid I do I still
don't think you can do that of course if
I say the word Lucid it starts uh
listening for The Voice Assistant which
isn't that great but hey it's still
going to be there uh but that that is
Advantage Lucid the fact that you can
change the amount of regen uh the seats
you'll notice do have a whole bunch of
different adjustment um it looks like
because they're perforated they would be
ventilated they are not so they are just
heated uh no ventilated seats here and
no heated steering wheel as well I
believe that is Advantage Tesla I think
you do get the heated steering wheel
with all Model S's um correct me if I'm
wrong on that though I'm pretty sure
that was at least when I bought my car
um you get a whole bunch of lighting
controls you get your charging again
they both have about 400 mil of range
but this one is the CCS Port while of
course the Tesla Supercharger network is
the advantage with the built-in NCS port
and all the integration with Tesla there
you can ignore that that is a major
major part of having an electric car and
road tripping if you're just charging in
your garage every night and starting
with a full battery these two cars will
feel about the same as far as daily
range usability but then it's just
driving the car actually living with and
driving this car and I got to say this
is from the top down and lucid's entire
lineup they've spent a lot on
engineering these cars and they still
drive better than Teslas um they handle
better the suspension is better and
that's impressive considering this isn't
even air suspension this car is on
adaptive dampers on steel Springs it is
not an air suspension Like the Model S
is is it's also only rear Real Drive
which is a good reason why it's slower
technically but I don't mind the
difference between a 3 second and 4
second 0 to 60 in this price range when
it rides this much better it's not a
sports car I love the extra speed of the
Tesla that's an advantage for it um so
off the line it's going to smoke this
but yeah this drives better handles
better is flatter through turns and
cornering and handles the poor roads of
New Jersey
better than every Tesla Model S so you
know again if you're going to road trip
there are other not even intangibles but
there are things like the charging
Network that will matter a lot like this
car can charge at 250 Kow but how easy
is it to find those Chargers how
reliable are those Chargers obviously
that all matters the other thing a lot
of Tesla people will point out is
self-driving the ability to buy the full
self-driving uh versus what this car is
capable of which is much more limited
for road trips that's going to make a
pretty big difference as well the Lucid
air also has a top down view when
parking and for some reason Tesla still
doesn't like to implement a camera
version of the top down view they'll do
a sort of advanced park assist where you
can see how far things are from you but
it's not a camera view so I must give
the advantage to
parking directly to Lucid also in case
anyone was wondering yes the Lucid does
have pet mode now but they call it
creature Comfort mode which is great but
it keeps your pets safe or keeps others
in the car cool while you're away to
keep the AC on so okay let's get to the
bottom of this if you put a put a a
threat to me right now and said hey
Marquez you can only buy one of these
two cars you have exactly $775,000 and
you need to either buy a base Tesla
Model S all-wheel drive or a base Lucid
air pure rear wheel drive they do make
an all-wheel drive version of the here
by the way it just costs more so which
base car do you go for the only factors
that matter a lot to me for this are
number one how much am I going to road
trip if I'm going to road trip a lot I'm
I'm taking the Tesla the peace of mind
is just worth that much to me the
all-wheel drive quickness and the just
the way that the the Tesla is just
intuitive and works kind of all the time
works with my phone key don't have to
think too hard about it that is very
very valuable for me and a lot of people
and the other factor is do you care
about carplay do you care about carplay
or not me personally actually not really
not that much so I think I would go with
the Tesla buy a hair but it is really
really impressive that lucid is actually
now shipping a car that is not crazy
expensive they're getting down into the
realm of price of other attainable I
mean this is going to be cheaper than
the rear whe Drive tyan is going to be
cheaper than a lot of other competitors
like a like an eqs so Props to Lucid for
getting there they're making it
available and then hopefully walking
people up the price ladder and maybe
somebody else will get a sapphire as
results of seeing this car all right
that's it let me know what you think
which one would you take Model S or air
pure thanks for watching catch you in
the next one peace"

the car world today is the Lexus LC 500
what people love so much about that car
is obviously The Styling it's a gorgeous
car it performance it's got 470
horsepower and it's got a naturally
aspirated V8 which is something you just
don't see in new performance cars
nowadays especially in The Grand Tour
segment and you might be thinking that
this is an Alexus LC 500 in front of me
but it's actually something
completely different kind of if we take
a look to the back of the car here
you'll see that it says Lexus
lc500h and that's because this is a
hybrid this is the Lexus
lc500 Hybrid and so essentially today's
video is going to be figuring
out today's video is essentially going
to be about exploring if if you take
away the na8 if you take away about a
100ish horsepower is this car still
worth buying it's a very interesting car
and probably the most Niche GT you could
possibly buy there's really no other car
that fits this exact specification as
far as what it offers on paper so let's
dive in this is the reason why no one is
really checking for the lc500h versus
the regular lc500 they've gotten rid of
the V8 and what we have here is a 3 and
1/2 L V6 which is found in a lot of
other Toyota models mixed with an
electric motor to give you what you have
here and uh it also costs more than the
standard lc500 I figured that's worth
mentioning it costs more by about $3,000
or so and so a lot of people aren't
going to necessarily be down for a much
more uh soulless experience in terms of
how it drives but we'll see a bit later
if that really is the case but with the
V six combined with the electric motors
you're getting about 354 horsepower and
370 lb feet of torque combined that's
grand total output from the V6 and the
electric motors and about 4ish miles of
EV only range so it's definitely not a
car you could just drive everywhere in
EV only mode and barely have to use the
gas engine but despite that apparently
this car can do almost 600 mil on a full
tank but is that really what you buy the
LC 500 for well maybe some but uh yeah
this is definitely more about efficiency
than performance and fun driving despite
it not having the most exciting
powertrain under the hood it's still an
absolutely beautiful car this silhouette
is just chef's kiss it's actually really
really great and I love honestly the
fact that you have these 21in rims on
here wrapped around uh in Pilot Sport
5s's so you know it grips very well not
so much when it's cold cuz it's rear
wheeel drive but very good good set of
tires on this car the overall look of
this car is definitely still there so I
mean if your priorities are having a
reliable power plant with that Toyota V6
which is known to be pretty solid and
have a very uh elegant Timeless design
that's comfortable on the inside which
you know we'll get into interior stuff a
little bit later this car still achieves
that do you want to spend more money to
achieve that with the
lc500h I guess that's really up to you
let's talk about one of my few gripes
with the lc500h is that you don't get a
powered trunk opening which is kind of
crazy If This Were you know a McLaren
that was all about weight savings and
being as light as humanly possible I'd
understand but this is a luxury Grand
Touring Car that weighs well over 4,000
lb and so not having a powered trunk is
kind of crazy and then when you dig on
the inside here it is not uh spacious at
all you could fit like a few carons in
here
like two literally and that's pretty
much it for me in my needs this is like
usable but it's certainly not great
given how like pretty decently big this
car is and so if you're looking for the
most practical GT this certainly is not
it unfortunately you also don't get soft
close so you have to really like slam it
shut like that to have it closed which
is kind of crazy for a GT especially how
much this costs but let's take a look
inside the LC
500 pretty interesting door opening
mechanism and uh let's step inside and
really see what this thing is all about
honestly I like this interior you've got
a lot of really great materials you got
this suede Alcantara type material the
leather you have the two-tone the red
and then you have one of the more
interesting Interiors you can get on a
Lexus SL Toyota today these seats very
comfortable very nice they look very
good very comfy headrests and then you
have this really interesting center
gauge that can actually slide around
like the legendary Lexus LFA and I'll
show that in a second but overall here I
like that this is a very nice
combination of digital and physical
controls let's go ahead and get this
powered
on you're going to hear the engine come
to life even though I assumed it would
be in EV mode and then in a second we're
going to see our pretty typical Toyota
infotainment boot up you know it's
pretty much no different than what you
would get on a regular Toyota or a
high-end
Lexus how can I help you and voice
activation which I've never actually
seen active but I guess I've never said
the name brand of the car but uh I'm
good I don't I don't need any help you
can cancel please
cancel let's see if it cancels
no sorry the network is currently busy
please try again later awesome thank you
thank you for that between these really
comfortable seats you have the nice sun
roof right up above me we've got back
seats which I mean I'll try to get back
there a little later but they're usable
certainly more usable than like a 911
per se but overall I like this interior
experience just sitting in here but I
don't know I feel like at a certain
price point some things just can't be
excused and I've noticed with a lot of
lexuses that we've tested on the
channel the gauge cluster you know you
have this cool little sliding gauge ring
that if I click this button right here
it should move over to the side yeah so
if I click that button moves over to the
side which is actually pretty sick and
then you can kind of go through this and
have more performance stats about you
know your electricity usage your
range the hybrid system forces because I
mean you know you might pull like you
know an eighth of a g in this thing
maybe your tire pressure this is a
really cool little slide engage cluster
menu thing to have but I don't know if
you can tell but that resolution just is
it's not it's not great it just screams
480p you know what I'm saying and you
have a really crisp very high definition
looking display right here so then to go
from this to that it's just a little
kind of offputting to me and really uh
just kind of reminds you that you're
still in a company that also makes
$25,000 cars as far as the primary
screen you're going to be interacting
with it's nice it's fluid you've got
Wireless Apple carplay and Android auto
and there's going to be very few times
where you need to actually interact with
the built-in Lexus software but when you
do that works perfectly fine as well and
uh the only time I really need to
interact with it is when I'm doing
climate stuff like changing my heated or
cooled seats or turning on my heated
steering wheel because there's no button
for that on the steering wheel despite
all these button spaces that I probably
don't use you have this view button if
you want to see around you it's got a
very interesting setup here kind of like
this kind of PS2 style uh 3D camera
parking system which I mean is actually
pretty accurate it just caught the
shadow of that car that drove by just
then I don't know if you just caught
that but if youve ever driven a Toyota
or a Lexus in the past 2 3 years this
experience is going to be pretty much
one to one with what you've experience
with all of those cars as far as
connectivity you do have USB C Port
right there as well as a usba a port
right there you have a little slot right
here to just hold keys and stuff like
that and you can slide that forward to
kind of hide that away and right here
where my water bottle is which you can
get at shop MKBHD
docomo cup holder but one thing that
we're not seeing anywhere at least not
that I found I don't see one anywhere is
a wireless phone tray and so you don't
have one in here you don't have one here
there's nothing right here there's
nothing right here and so that's just a
little disappointing to not have a
wireless phone charger in a car like
this a car that's generally speaking
decently spacious for the driver and
front passenger and so you'd figure
they'd make room somewhere to have a
nice dedicated spot to hold your phone
but I've usually just default Ed to
having my phone where you see it right
now which is down there because there
isn't a wireless charging slot or just a
natural place to put your phone anywhere
in the car which is a little
disappointing but I did say I was going
to try to get in the back seat so I I'm
pretty reluctant but for science we will
do it
so we have a pull tab right here that we
can count of just well I'm going to have
to release seat belt then we have this
pull tab right here the seat
automatically comes forward
and then I should be able to get
in like this oh man that roof line is
crazy oh my god wow my I mean I'm not
like a crazy tall guy I'm like just
under 6 feet and yeah look at that my
head is like basically colliding with
the roof I have to literally lean down
otherwise my head just straight up
collides with the roof
so I'm going to put the seat back back
see how that feels oh yeah it's it's
cramped you see you can my uh my toes
are pretty much they've disappeared
under the seat and uh yeah my head is
pretty much uh touching the glass right
now and so if there's any harsh bumps
when driving this car it's you might you
might be concussed just a little bit
this is not great and so the lc500 in H
form and nonh form comes in a
convertible spec as well and so so the
back seats make much more sense when you
have the convertible because there just
won't be anything above your head but if
you have the
coupe uh yeah I know Marquez would
literally not fit back here try to get
out of here oh man that is not yeah
because of this roof line situation it's
just not fun getting in or out of these
seats yeah not a fun time
necessarily and so interior experience
overall is not terrible right there's
some good things about it it's
comfortable all the materials in here
feel premium and put together very
nicely the speakers they're all right
they're not like they don't blow me away
I think they're just fine for a car like
this there's certainly other cars that
would offer better experience like a BMW
m850 would offer better experience and
costs kind of around in the same general
price realm as this car uh uh
infotainment is solid no complaints
there the gauge cluster is just a little
potato Camy that's really the only thing
with that but functionality wise
everything in here works really well I
guess the only question now is how does
this uh car drive when you don't have
the na8 and almost 500 horsepower to the
wheels let's find out best thing about
being inside the car now is that I no
longer need my little uh windscreen soul
patch so you can stop staring at my
chest now right now we've got it into
Sport Plus mode just because there isn't
a huge difference between comfort in
sport outside of just gearing and I
guess the aggressiveness of the
powertrain
obviously but let's take a listen to
that sound let's see let's let's get
some sound action going this has a very
interesting
[Music]
sound he
going it doesn't exactly sound uh
like a naturally aspirated High reving
V8 it's it doesn't have the most
Pleasant sound I've experienced in any
uh car of this price segment ever and
the gearing is also a very interesting
thing here so this car has two
Transmissions like a lot of new hybrids
do you have firstly a CVT which has
essentially six virtual gears and then
you have another traditional four-speed
automatic that is providing for real
gears and so on the gauge cluster here
it says you've got 10 gears total
between the two Transmissions one of
them being a pretty crappy CVT and the
other one being a four-speed automatic
and so shifting in this car feels
absolutely
soulless it feels like literally nothing
it might as well be an EV I feel more
engaged shifting gears in the hyai ionic
5n which does not have any so it's not
the most engaging car in terms of going
up and down in the gear but I don't
think that's what it's about I don't
think you're really supposed to put this
car in manual mode at all in fact Lexus
has what they're calling AI shift logic
or something like that to essentially
determine what gears the car should be
in even in Sport Plus mode and things
like that which I mean that's just a
fancy way of saying hey this is an
automatic but whatever you want to say
Toyota I will say
though it's technically not that much
slower than the V8 powered LC 500
and that's because it's still rear wheel
drive so you don't have crazy offthe
line performance and neither does the V8
powered lc500 you're working with about
a 4.7 second 0 to 60 which is literally
.1 seconds slower than the V8 version
there's not that big of a difference
here but because it's rear wheel
drive you could slide it just a little
bit so you know if you've got it in
first gear and I mean only first gear
you can do you know some power slides
and things like that but regardless that
is not what this car is about by any
means oh man I just can't get over how
just like not good that V6 sounds in
terms of handling the car isn't bad um I
think the steering feel is As Dead As a
door knob to be quite honest but
technically it's not a bad Handler
you've got a pretty solid suspension
setup that is certainly more Comfort
oriented than performance driving
oriented but it takes a corner decently
well granted if it's a little cold the
tires might spin up on you a little bit
if you're taking it at a slightly higher
speed but overall handling is pretty I
don't want to say sharp but uh assertive
Comfort is really why you buy a car like
this comfort and decent straight line
performance and yeah it does the Comfort
part
very
well yeah he likes to slide a little bit
but it it's very resistant to do so so
while I swim through this sea of pickup
trucks let's talk about who this car is
for and what the competitors are in this
price range so if we're talking about a
2 plus2 GT coupe on the higher end of
this price range we're looking at base
model 911s or a 911 Cabriolet
on the lower end of that price bracket
you're looking at
BMW not M8 but m850i basically the M
sport uh Coupe 2 plus two version of the
8 series and either Coupe or convertible
form honestly I'd probably buy either
one of those cars before this one just
because I don't need the hybrid stuff
and with an extended range fuel tank in
a 911 you could easily do 500 mil on a
full tank in one of those
cars and that's basically the same case
for here but except you're getting a
much more uh uh more balanced Driving
Experience for one it also is going to
be a car that holds more value it's also
is a car that uh I think just sounds
better and is just built a little bit
better than this has a much higher
quality Tech in the car and then that
BMW m850i is just going to be so so so
so much faster than this car those cars
have about 550 something horsepower and
it's going to definitely feel like it
this car gets up there you can easily
get to 100 m hour without really
thinking about it but you don't feel
anything when you're doing so and so
that's like the part of the car that
feels just very soulless to me we also
have to reiterate the fact that this car
costs more than the V8 version which a
lot of people would argue is the better
car overall if you're so worried about
you know efficiency you probably
wouldn't buy a car like the LC 500
anyway there's plenty of other lexuses
and Toyotas that offer really incredible
efficiency but if you want to just break
it down to the bare minimum specs right
rear wheeel
drive V6 hybrid 2 plus2
Coupe there really is nothing else that
offers exactly that experience
especially one with the Wii we two
transmission CVT plus a four-speed setup
there's really nothing that offers an
experience like that and so it is kind
of hard to compare it to other cars that
on paper are similar but not exactly the
same just because of how unique this
overall package is but if you're looking
for something that might have the
reliability of a
Toyota uh with really great styling
comfortable interior solid efficiency
and you don't care about losing
performance
and fun factor with that V8 and don't
also need rear roll drive basically if
you're like an old person in Florida who
doesn't want a V8 but still want
something that looks good but is still
wanting to spend over 100 Grand and
doesn't want a Porsche or a BMW or
something else then this car I guess
fits the bill it drives nicely I think
the transmission setup and the motor
sound they're kind of weird but outside
of that the car car drives nicely it's
not a bad driving car overall it just
isn't really fun in any sense but that's
pretty much it for this one this is a
weird car and I would really hope if you
were to buy this that you wouldn't buy
it brand new and buy one that's like
used for probably tens of thousands of
dollars less but uh very interesting
experience one of the most interesting
hybrid cars I think we've ever tested on
the channel for
sure all right that's about it for this
one if you enjoyed be sure to give this

also here up and uh we've got a car here
this is a Mercedes this is a
gt63 performance four-door four-door
version of this car and uh it's a hybrid
and we've both been testing it we both
have some thoughts and notes on using it
mine in one area yours in another it's
it's fast it's a really high Performance
Hybrid but it is also a hybrid so it's
got these trade-offs that it's made to
be you know a little bit of S-Class
interior a little bit of extra fun to
drive and I don't mind this color either
it's kind of like a sort of a baby blue
I hope the camera picks that up well
shout out to the iPhone 16 color science
but we're just going to go over the
things we like the things we don't like
and the things that make this car kind
of unique for
$22
$20,000 should you want to buy one of
these all right miles I think you should
tell us about the performance numbers CU
it's kind of nuts yeah so these cars
were already fast they were kind of like
in the M5 uh r 7 competitor category but
if I can actually find the hood latch
here so we've got the standard twin
turbo V8 in this car that we've seen all
the other like Flagship amgs but now we
have a hybrid motor attached to it so
now we're making
832 horsepower and 1,000 plus pound feet
of torque so 0 to 60 despite this car
weighing over 5200 lb is below three so
it's
it's quite the huler so when I hear that
I think okay great hybrid means it's got
to have some size of a battery that's
going to just juice the lag points where
these transmissions and engines can't
quite be as fluid as an EV awesome and
then I hear 4.8 Kow hour battery which
okay that's big enough to give you some
real range uh like we had a Corvette eay
not too long ago and that had like a one
and half Kow battery like four miles
range it's not really meant to drive it
on EV only range but this is a three
times a size battery but e range is is
still not amazing it's looking like
it'll be somewhere between 7 to 12 miles
of e only range but you can do it you
can switch it to Electric mode and it'll
do that for you but I think they're
really still doing it for performance
when you drive this thing you feel that
what are the numbers so it's
2.8 seconds to
60 and then it keeps it keeps going
which is awesome well till nearly 200
miles hour which
is that's a lot that's a lot for a sedan
and then more on performance I actually
really like these wheels these might be
my favorite piece and maybe my favorite
Wheel On Any Car we've tested this year
it's got carbon ceramic brakes behind it
you can see that huge brake caliper but
also the black wheel design I like and
then it's got this extra bit all the way
around three lines of what feels like
just aerodynamic features to bring heat
away from the brakes they're a little
bit pliable but I don't think that
should be a problem so I really like
these wheels they've got Pilot Sport
4S's on all four corners
and uh not a bad look good stopping
power for sure definitely I mean when it
weighs 5200 lb you need that and I'm
happy that it has it and then
practicality wise you just saw it
doesn't have a front trunk right it's a
hybrid it has a full-on engine in the
front but it does still have full-on
sedan type hatchback
features uh and I do I do want to
highlight this also one more thing this
is hilarious you see the gas cap right
there and then you also see another cap
right here this is this is where you
charge it I'll let the jokes make them
El but that's where you plug in it's not
a super fast charger but you just plug
it right in the back there and top up
that battery but then it does have a
trunk yeah which I mean it is
compromised because you have the Hybrid
battery system so in the non-e
performance versions of these cars this
would essentially not be here and it
would be like a lot more flat but it's
comparable to like a Panamera turbo or
Turbo S so decent amount of space I
checked under here as well not a ton of
space but you could slip maybe some
charging cables down there cool that's
where your actual charging cables are
speakers in the back not bad like not
bad something that I do find interesting
is that on all the Mercedes EVS you
don't have a charging port in the rear
but for the car that can actually regain
electric range without you having to
plug it in they have like objectively
somewhat the most convenient charging
port if you're going to be backing into
a spot so I found that interesting you
know there's this whole debate going on
of where you put the charging port on
and EV or anything that plugs in
obviously Teslas have had it back
left okay maybe I'll I'll wait for him
to
Park 1 hour
later just give him the second 2 hours
later and you day now yeah take your
time 5 hours
later yep
it's almost
there so okay there's this huge debate
on where you put the charging plug
because Teslas have always had it rear
left and now if you want to be
compatible with Tesla's Chargers rear
left is ideal because then you don't
take up more than one space um some like
rivan like R2 had it on the right and
some of their mockups and some others
have it in the front this seems like
probably an ideal place to be compatible
with the most Chargers and not be a
problem so I don't mind that but of
course since it's a sedan we got to
check out the back seats this is the 63
driving position I've set up for myself
and uh what do you think I mean this is
not the biggest sedan in the world but
it's it's comfortable two seats it's
definitely more cramped in here than an
S-Class but certainly better than like
the I5 M50 which had pretty cramped back
seats the I4 uh even some of Mercedes
bigger sedans or some of Audi's bigger
sedans like the RS7 uh the RS6 this is a
decent amount of space for sure but if
you want the most amount of back seating
space that's where you go for like the
S63 which also comes in a crazy hybrid
setup yeah I don't mind this I was
always saying before and I had this in
my notes like Mercedes a lot of their
cars have this enormous center console
like this is a super wide center console
and you'll see in the front seat in a
second my knee literally hits both the
wheel and the center console but that
continues all the way through the middle
here so yeah no rear middle seat just a
bunch of storage you've got like like
matte carbon fiber and like these cup
holders and the air conditioning
controls which is sweet so I like it
it's just it's really wide it feels like
it's right up against my leg there yeah
it feels like there should be more going
on here given how much is compromised in
the middle but these cup holders are
cooled and heated which is something
you're not getting on the front which I
actually find to be a little weird but
the back seat gets a bit more of a uh
you know luxury limo experience with
these heated and cooled cup holders
which are actually pretty functional it
get pretty warm in here but I think that
brings us to the natural place to talk
the most about this car which is the
front seat
so let's sit in the driver's
seat and this is going to feel very
familiar for uh anyone who's driven any
of Mercedes hybrids or even EVS if
you've driven an eqs even a lot of these
uh pixels up front there's a start stop
engine button I'll press that fire it up
and uh that's a sound yeah that's quite
the sound that's a specific deep rumbly
sound that they've programmed for this
car I've talked about the software in
these Mercedes cars before I don't know
if you have strong feelings about them
but to me the UI still feels very
Windows Vista if I'm being honest which
is that's not a bad thing it's just a
lot of big icons are easy to navigate
and this like blue gradient in the
background I immediately throw on
carplay that's my thing but how do you
feel about the software that's happening
I do think the iconography could use a
bit of an overhaul and Mercedes has this
weird thing where they're still using
some of the older gen screen setups in
the newer cars and then in other
vehicles you can get the hypers screen
and like the standard E-class which is
that's a you know that's an acquired
taste I think but functionally speaking
I think it's fine there's a few settings
that I feel like are in places that
don't make sense like to access certain
sound features for the assisted driving
you have to go into completely different
menu when you'd assume it just be in the
sound setting just little things like
that but like you said yeah you just
turn it on it goes into Apple carplay
which thankfully in this car unlike
other Mercedes we've tested it's been
perfectly fine for me I haven't had any
random disconnects or anything like that
it's a fluid OS and I think it's pretty
much just in line with BMW I'd say in
certain versions of the screen it's
slightly better than BMWs yeah I don't
mind it I just think a visual overhaul
would take it a long way cuz it's very
functional just could look a little
better uh but then the rest of the
physical controls like I said super wide
center console this is hilarious to me
cuz this wheel is not that big it's just
this is so wide but then you have all
your physicals I mean I love these These
are super fun and spinning you can close
or open them like that you can point
them anywhere they're all over the place
there's an HUD up front and that's super
bright I like seeing that and then this
is uh I guess I like this because I have
a car that also has this but the the
mode switch if you want to go to sport
mode hear the engine fire up see the
settings change visually on the screen
as well if I want to go Sport Plus hear
those valves open up valves opened up
you can hear it's a little louder and I
can even go race mode so if I pop
between these settings you see them all
adjust in real time and then if I want
specifically to adjust the suspension I
can do just the suspension to be harder
or softer if I want to flip through all
of those and then Arrow so there's an
arrow button so I'm going to point the
camera back there and hit the arrow
button
there's a little spoiler that pops up so
you have individual control over that so
I'm I'm a fan of the physical controls
here happening nice steering wheel it's
funny because this is the same Drive
stock Model S uses so I I see it as a
Model S stock but Mercedes has been
using this for longer so I'm familiar
with that too good stuff but I think the
last thing about controls that I want to
point out is there's only a certain
number of ways to do some of the
controls on the screen that I think I I
think I got annoyed by yeah like the
only way to change let's say you have
music playing or podcast playing and you
want to move forward or a next track you
can either reach up and do it oh that is
a great Point Mercedes so you can do it
with your voice you can say it out loud
and it'll hear you I didn't really do
that much which means the only other way
you can do that is look on the steering
wheel and realize there are no ways to
move between tracks here and you
actually have to reach down here and hit
this button and then tell it forward or
backwards so if there's media playing
you have to touch up front anyway I
didn't love that and then moving around
up here is
also that's just not my favorite thing
and then you have to do this track pad
it's not very fluid at all uh I feel
like uh some sort of like joystick setup
or maybe even just straight up like a
d-pad situation that doesn't require
like you kind of just like guessing to
figure out where like the cursor is
pointed on the screen this is something
they've been doing for a while and
they're seemingly thoroughly committed
to it and I kind of wish that wasn't the
case I mean you have it on this side as
well so maybe just have more honed in
media controls on the right side so that
it's not as frustrating to just go
forward and back between the tracks that
you're playing yeah through Apple
carplay yeah I would like to see more
like a physical joystick as well uh but
these physical controls are all great
you got your USBC ports it is Wireless
carplay so you have that freed up to
just charge your phone I'm a fan though
too of of I mean we're looking at a
performance car with a lot of matte
carbon fiber all over the place so I
just like looking at the buttons and
switches in this car because they look
fantastic but then it's just about
driving and turns out it's incredibly
fast it's really quick I'm going to go
from Comfort to sport to Sport Plus to
race any other car I think of race mode
I think of like you're hearing the high
RPMs and to be fair it's at 2,000 1500
I'm going to stomp on it
you felt the difference like though yeah
there's that gap
between the electric surge which isn't
nothing but it gets you off the line and
then the spool up and now we're at 4,000
which is where I thought it would have
been to start with that's what I noticed
it doesn't have as crazy of an initial
bite from a roll obviously when you put
it in launch control which I don't know
if you've tried that yet I haven't I bet
it kills from a dig yeah from a dig it's
pretty incred I mean I got a 2.8 on the
street which I mean I can throw like a
screenshot somewhere in the middle here
it's a really quick car from a dig and
the seat belts like are almost
strangling you you get get a little
woozy afterwards uh but it's really once
you get to that second third gear and it
keeps pulling where you're really
feeling that 800 horsepower like oh yeah
this thing is a a freight train that is
not stopping anytime soon so it's
actually very very usable in electric
mode as far as is just the Classic I
want to drive out of my town without
making a lot of noise not that this is
the loudest car it's really not that
loud at all and so I don't think that
would be a reason to get this but yeah
as of right now it's showing maybe 75%
battery and says six miles of range in
electric mode how do you feel about that
sound it's interesting it's way less
aggressive than the AMG EQ cars those
are just like I mean I feel like that
those are like an orchestra like a
symphony of sounds yeah it's like very
sci-fi-esque I feel like you know the
BMW EVS with the Han Zimmer stuff that's
a lot more orchestral to me whereas AMG
is going straight up like sci-fi alien
yeah with the sounds so if I push my
pedal past that point it automatically
switches to comfort mode which is hybrid
it's between the gas and electric and so
I could see the RPMs turn on on and
everything is is on now it's uh it's
kind of nice that there's like a a
pressure point in the
pedal that I know I'm going to turn on
the gas motor so good to see it's also
nice to drive on roads that I've driven
on before because this is how I compare
suspensions of cars how did these bumps
feel in the other car versus this car
after having driven the S63 performance
which you also got to drive when we had
that for the assisted driving stuff I'd
say they're pretty close in terms of
comfort levels and I don't know if that
means like the S-Class AMG is not as
comfortable as it should be or this is
more comfortable than it should be given
that it's the more sporty four-door
sedan yeah I wouldn't mind it being a
little firmer but that's just me that's
like a personal preference I do think
it's very very comfortable and compliant
for a performance car yeah I mean I
think as two people who are driving twoo
like sports o our frame of reference per
Comfort has maybe been slightly altered
and so for me yeah I could 100% drive
this every day longdistance drives I
mean these seats are like really
comfortable these seats are nice I was
just playing with the the cool the
ventilation in the
seat great it's quick it's powerful yeah
I don't need a full blast I can turn it
down yeah these are good seats there's
almost nothing to say about the basics
cuz it just Nails them like visibility
okay yeah it's not like a crazy car so
it has great visibility it's got the
sunroof that you can close it's split in
half but you can close either side
mirrors are big it's got all the systems
it's just it's not missing anything yeah
I'd say it's you've got pretty much
85% of the S-Class luxury experience
from the inside that car rides just like
a hair better and it's definitely more
insulated even though this also has the
the double glaze Windows good there's
definitely more noise here than what you
get on the S63 AMG but it's about 85%
there and so on the Comfort end of
things if you're looking for something
that's more than 75% as good this
is easily like a good alternative okay
so that brings me to the competition and
the price because this is a really
expensive car if it's if it's going to
be
$220,000 like there are some serious
cars that you could get from that money
yeah and so you were saying basically it
feels like they aimed this at the PanAm
because that's also a really expensive
four-door athletic sedan type thing and
that can also easily be 200 220
plus but I was just thinking you could
step up a little bit and get I was going
to say the Lucid air GT but you could
get a lucid air Sapphire for 250 yeah I
mean if you got like the most expensive
paint option possible for this car and
maybe had a bit more of like the carbon
fiber trim you could probably get this
knocking on the door of a quarter
million and at that point you're at
Lucid a sapphire territory which I mean
that's a completely different experience
as far as like the luxury side of things
it's not customizable at all it's just
like a cyber truck where it's like what
you see is what you get but on the
performance end of things it's still
probably like more than twice as quick
and pretty much every scenario possible
me personally I care more about that
than I mean the interior is incredible
here and the interior if we just go
straight to the Lucid is nice but it's
different it's like just kind of blank
it's like the alcanta and like they ship
them all with the same literally the
same paint there's no options but I
would do that for double the performance
and like the best handling and honestly
it probably weighs about the same I
think the sapphire in this are almost
identical in weight actually which is
quite surprising but that car feels a
lot more athletic ites overall so yeah
range might be the same in both of these
cars as well probably just about if you
Grandma drive in this you're probably
going to knock on the door of like 350
maybe 400 and the Lucid Sapphire I think
is rated at like 400 miles yeah so
that's a comparison I found interesting
then there's maybe you can step down
to I mean there's lots of other
performance sedans that are going to be
luxury biased yeah Audi RS7 yeah uh BMW
M5 which I mean weighs more than this
with less power that's also a hybrid car
yeah um I would probably opt for this
versus the M5 which I mean we haven't
driven that yet um and definitely up the
R7 just because of the hybrid speed they
don't make the R7 in a hybrid yet and so
this is going to smoke that car in
pretty much every scenario possible
there's still not a whole lot of direct
competitors for this outs side of the
Panamera Turbo S E hybrid which I mean
we haven't driven that yet but based on
what I have experienced with Porsches I
would imagine that's probably a more
athletic car I think yeah I think that
car is probably going to ride firmer
probably going to handle a little better
and feel a little more sporty than this
at the expense of some of the luxury
feel of what you get from an AMG which
is fine that's a customer so I don't
think this car has any real flaws other
than
than the price yeah the competition
which I mean eventually it will it will
come down if you're looking to buy like
used or
pre-owned um but I'd say it's a very
good cheaper alternative to a Panamera
Turbo S hybrid I think that's exactly
what they put on their drawing board
when they set out to make this car they
were hoping that that sentence would
come out of someone's mouth yeah and I
think they probably got what they wanted
there"

back with one of I think maybe the most
surprising SL impressive electric
vehicles I've tested so far maybe
because I didn't have my eye on it but
it's turned out to be a lot more than I
thought this is also the first video
shot on the iPhone 16 Pro so some of you
will be here to see this footage some of
you will be here to see this vehicle
this is a Chevy Silverado EV so it's
their full-size pickup truck so there's
only a few full-size electric pickup
trucks out right now right there's
obviously the Tesla cyber truck there's
the Ford F-150 Lightning there's the
rivan r1t and then there's the Hummer EV
that's all I really count CU that's all
you can get in the US and every time I
would talk about them this this would
always get comments like people going
like don't forget about the Silverado
it's got 450 Mi of range don't forget
about the Silverado EV but it wasn't
shipping yet so I wasn't ready to
include it yet but now that it's out and
now that we actually got one here
bro yeah this this should be right on
top of the list for a lot of people and
I'm going to start by just talking about
the things that I like about it and the
number one thing I like about it is the
range so this is the rst this is the top
of the line This is the $100,000 truck
and it is a full-size truck like I said
so it is absolutely massive you can see
it sitting on I want to say yeah 24 in
wheels so these these are Big Wheels and
it's still like looks like a regular
size wheel on this thing 6t bed massive
but all the space down here is for a 200
105 KW hour battery just for a little
context uh typical EV has somewhere
between like a 70 to 110 Kow hour
battery the rivan r1t has a 130ish Kow
hour
battery
205 and so it's rated for 440 M of range
and that's already impressive but here's
the the even crazier part it kind of
adjusts based on how you drive it and if
you're not towing anything you're just
cruising around and using regen which
let's face it a lot of people will it'll
show even more when I first got this
plugged up to 100% it was showing me
475 M of range that actually makes it
the most range I have ever tested on any
electric vehicle ever I haven't tested I
think there's some Lucid that cross over
the 500 Mark I haven't actually gotten
to drive those yet but who would have
thought it would be a full-size truck
that gets us there now that's maybe not
shocking because of the 205 k hour
battery down there but the Hummer e also
has a 200 plus Kow hour battery but it's
a Hummer it's like a refrigerator on
Wheels it doesn't have the arrow this
does have the arrow so yeah that's
that's going to be the number one thing
I like about it is that on these street
tires with no payload you know this
front grill is half covered it's got a
pretty aerodynamic front shape these
back triangles are
aerodynamic and obviously there's
nothing being towed right now but even
right now it's showing like 90 3%
battery is 434 miles it's pretty good um
so that's that's that's great for trucks
I mean that's going to relieve range
anxiety once you do start Towing and
using the truck bed it's got a 1500 lb
payload and I think a 10,000lb towing
capacity 10 or 15 I I'll put the text on
the screen but then you're you're going
to start eating to the battery obviously
it's very important to have a lot of
available range so that you can eat into
that when you do work with this truck
but if you're just driving around
cruising yeah that's pretty sick now the
next thing I really liked is storage now
is a full-size truck so this isn't a
surprise for anyone familiar with
full-size trucks but every time I get in
one I'm just a little bit Blown Away by
how much there is so let me just shut
that up for a second actually one more
quick tidbit this EV doesn't have an
ignition button or switch anywhere you
just put on the brake and start and I
love that that's actually pretty rare
it's basically feels it's just Teslas
and every other EV seems to have like a
power button right here to turn it on or
turn it off this one doesn't have that
you just put on the brake and go when
you're done you just get out and walk
away and it turns off I like that a lot
so shout out to Chevy for that but yeah
okay you get in and there is Storage
everywhere there's a whole bunch of
these water bottle holders cup holders
bunch of cup holders here phone spot
obviously I have my mic here wireless
charger there's ports in here there's
another port in here we'll talk about
that adapter in a second but little more
more storage up top here and then a real
glove box for even more storage there's
a lot but then it's not just front seat
where you get storage it's the back
seats and even behind the driver too so
this is a 63 driving position and
immediately you can tell oh yeah oh yeah
there is a ton a ton of leg room up here
I mean I'm lounging back basically uh
also I can really fully show the 251
Lowe's now so you guys have been seeing
them in these videos but now you can see
them for real but yeah tons of storage
here you've got the same door situation
little pocket there cup holders more
storage down here but then we are in the
back seat where you can fully move I
mean you've seen these Silverado e or
pickup trucks before probably
but seat folds up right there store some
stuff on top of the speaker I can even
stand up and pull this other one and
show you've got charging equipment
underneath the seats so this is a whole
section can I go Ultra wide no I can't
go to ultra wide while I'm on the
primary camera but that is a whole bunch
more
storage in the back seat I mean this is
an
enormous enormous cabin but we're not
done we got to get even further back cuz
it's a full size pickup truck after all
and that's a 6ft bed now like I said
this here a little bit of Arrow but you
can still reach in there's a powered
Tano cover and then this full 6ft bed
which you can store a ton of stuff in
and if you're familiar with the
Silverado you know about the midgate
which will allow you to store even
larger items I'm also kind of fan of uh
this little half half open setup so if
you want to open just that top half of
the tailgate and reach in and grab
something real quick that's cool too or
open the entire thing with that button
and if you want to store the absolute
most you can open the midgate and put
this bottom section up and that'll store
about 10 ft
of stuff and yeah there's Outlets
there's all the utility in the world I
don't have to tell you this it's a
pickup truck it does work stuff it's
great so storage Galore that's the
second thing I was uh immediately very
happy with third is how they achieve the
range with the one pedal driving and the
regen so the Silverado EV has some Peak
e stuff going on here right so first of
all like I said no power button needed
get in have the key in your pocket foot
on the brake truck is on that's great
right second of all as you're driving
there is pretty strong liftoff regen and
in regular mode so there's these Drive
modes here normal mode you're driving
you lift your foot off the brake and it
some pretty strong Regen to be basically
one pedal driving but even if you don't
do that there's also this little pedal
behind the wheel a lot of GMS have this
now where if you squeeze this this will
add regen and slow you down faster and
it's actually a bit of a two-stage
button where if I squeeze even harder it
will add more
regen and actually completely avoid
using the brake pedals at all like you
can stop really quickly with just this
pedal so if you drive with your hand on
the wheel just like that you basically
don't have to use the brake pedal at all
that's awesome that's Peak EV another
thing that's great about an EV and this
could have been in the storage section
is a powered front trunk you do have to
hold that down to open it but of course
you can see that in front of us here and
let me just check out let's see how much
storage is in the front trunk because I
think they kind of know what people are
going to be doing with this which is
tailgating but in the front what's that
called front gating I don't know but you
can clearly sit here if you want you can
put this net down but I think a lot of
people you know put some groceries in
here do some casual shopping and that's
a good amount of storage space but also
like there's cup holders they know what
going on there's drain plugs they know
it's going on so this is a pretty
convenient Peak EV feature as well good
to see a powered front trunk my only
downside is I couldn't find a way to
close it from outside so I have to go
back in and close it but that's just one
more thing it's got going for it and
then number three for Peak EV is the
Silverado EV can charge at Tesla
superchargers so this is a deal that
they just struck but this 400 450 m
range EV with all this great regen can
also
use this adapter right here and charge
at something like 15 or 177,000 Tesla
superchargers you've got your account
you can log in and it's essentially plug
andplay with this adapter like we've
seen with rivan and others
so even more peeky V and then just
besides all that it is it is like well
trimmed and well equipped too like you
see this huge sunroof over my head you
see all this rst and nice red and blue
contrast stitching this is a a little
bit sloppy looking stitching if you ask
me but it is more red and blue stitching
these are comfortable heated seats those
are heated back seats these are also
ventilated seats if you want that which
I do it also has super Cruise so if you
want a little bit of self-driving action
basically only on highways it will also
do that it's got the HD in front of me
this is a well equ equipped
$100,000 car and then there's also a
whole bunch of Google with the software
so if I'm actually really liking it when
you log in so you go home all this stuff
you can log in with your Google account
and have Google Assistant stuff where
you ask it to call your contacts you ask
it to turn up and down here actually do
it turn down the
temperature all right turning down the
temperature it is very responsive and
very quick and if you're logged in it
can actually call your contacts and
navigate to places from your history and
all sorts of stuff like that so that's
cool and it's got this screen behind as
well I found this pretty responsive you
can log in grab apps from the Play Store
like Spotify your podcast app pair your
phone ways it's all here so this is good
also there's this volume button which is
kind of a Mach EES and then there's a
button on top to mute and then all the
aack controls are physical controls so
you can just reach down here and just
grab and change the temperature real
quick so if you don't feel like asking
Google you can just do this and then
they're desynced and you can sync them
back up if you want this is good too so
I felt like the interior is a nice place
to be I feel I mean I I have a cyber
truck I realize that these trucks are
always huge but this just feels like I'm
in a house right now I'm in like a
massive space the climate controlled
room with like a glass sunroof and
comfortable seats like this is very this
is a good spot this is a good place to
be I would say driving the Silverado EV
is also relaxing in a way where it is it
is maybe the least athletic of the full
size electri pickup trucks like you have
the Cyber truck which has like 800
something horsepower you have the rivan
which goes up to a th000 now like they
all have these Sprint modes and these
sport modes this doesn't really do the
sporty thing I think that's a direct
trade-off with the 400 plus miles of
range you're going to get out of this
and maybe that's a downside maybe you
don't care I think a lot of people
buying a pickup truck honestly don't
care uh so getting that ease of Mind of
a 4 and can I say it 475 mile range and
work on the street is it might be even
more with the 2025 models I think that's
worth it to a lot of people and it's got
the aesthetic it's got the light bar
it's got the front trunk it's got Peak
EV I'm impressed I think this is shot
right up to the top of my list of best
full-size Eevee pickup trucks I mean the
competition right now is the Hummer the
F-150
Lightning and I guess you could say this
ever truck is a full-size electric
pickup truck and uh this is the one with
the most range and the most Comfort I
will say very nice well done Chevy well
done Silverado team for actually
shipping the thing and uh I hope to see
more of these on the road it's good all
right glad I got to check it out thanks
for watching now you've seen iPhone 16
Pro footage as well talk to you guys
soon peace"

I haven't given out any awards or
anything crazy like that yet but I feel
like if I did you guys have seen the
videos there's probably about two things
that I would give out awards for one is
an award for the EV that was best to
become electric from the gas version and
the other would be the EV that is
hardest to tell is
electric and that would be this thing
back here I think the previous winner
may have been like a like an F-150
Lightning because the F-150 Lightning is
basically an F-150 that happens to be
electric but it's also got the
headlights and the tailights and you can
tell looking at it that's the electric
one this is a Mercedes V Sprinter it's a
cargo van this is one of those types of
vehicles that is really good just for
local deliveries like yeah the electric
one it's less than 10K more than the gas
one it's very much just as capable and
you basically can't tell at all that
it's electric now this one blue maybe
that's a bit of a giveaway but you can
see it a blue regular Sprinter here's
the only actual giveaways that this is
electric this one badge right here says
electric you got this whole giant van
here and no other part of it says it's
electric until the back where it says
esprinter is that letter e right there
but the Mercedes Sprinter is is kind of
iconic you've probably seen these things
before driving it is hilarious because
uh I don't drive vehicles this gigantic
very often with these massive extended
wheelbases and extra ceiling height and
all that so it's just been fun driving a
gigantic cargo van around for a little
bit but when it comes to local
deliveries around neighborhoods with not
a super far distance to
travel this comes off as smoother
quieter more comfortable cheaper to
operate less moving Parts less
maintenance and even a little friendlier
because it's quieter for just driving
around neighborhoods it's the esprinter
these are the kind of vehicles that you
don't really even think about the
features of because you never have to
drive one and it kind of just Blends in
around you you've probably seen several
of these already this week and not even
noticed you know just cargo vans in
general delivery Vans I was behind a
random Nissan one on the highway today
before I realized it was basically the
exact same shape as the Sprinter but all
you really are working with here is a
cab at the front which is pretty simple
some basic Creature Comforts here and
then you get around to the back and
there is some amount of storage uh kind
of similar to that remember the rivan
delivery van that I made a video about
similar to that so there's some uh
Windows back here at a camera up top to
see what's behind you you open the back
and right now all we've got back
here is a giant pallet and this happens
to be a a 450 lb box and I could explain
why in a second but there's not really a
whole lot else going on in the back
there's no windows there's no shelves
it's just you need cargo space we got
cargo space so you got the tie downs
you've got the box this is what you're
transferring around in the Sprinter this
type of stuff maybe it's video gear
maybe it's other stuff it's up to you so
let me show you the front because the
front of the Sprinter is kind of funny
and I'll explain why I say that but
again you know you probably don't drive
vehicles like this very often so you
might not have seen the inside of one of
these so here's the cabin and here is
the uh step up into the very elevated
driver's seat of the East Sprinter so
let's talk
features here are all the features that
I found in the cabin of the East
Sprinter cargo
space that's basically it I'm just
kidding I mean there a couple other
things but I'm not I'm not actually
kidding there's mainly just cargo space
everywhere so there's this steering
wheel I mean this is uh kind of
hilarious that it's almost the same
steering wheel as you've seen in other
Mercedes vehicles but there's your uh
self-d driver controls there's your
media controls your horn nice a high
pitched horn but then storage base goes
crazy all right so there's a little bit
here there's obviously a lot of door
storage space your your cup holder your
water bottles things like that over on
the left not a lot of storage until you
get up here cup holder cup holder more
storage maybe you could put a phone
there but also maybe you could put a
phone here matter of fact yeah I think
you can put a phone there or you can put
a phone there but you also have cup
holder you have a cup holder here you
have a cup holder you have a cup holder
and then there's no glove box but you
could totally put stuff that you want
that just like paperwork and
registration stuff up here or or you
know you could you could also put it up
here
it's nice or you could put it up over
here that's cool too and here's another
thing I've noticed is this uh this
doesn't have a mirror the way most of
these big sun shades usually do but in
the middle here is a camera for a mirror
because behind you in the eprinter is
just the cargo space so you can't
actually use this as a mirror to see
what's behind you so this is that camera
that's behind you and you can point that
up or down a little bit but if you turn
that off it's still a regular mirror and
so you could just kind of point it
directly at yourself and and use that as
a mirror because there's no mirror here
maybe that's not what it's for but
anyway you can see behind you at all
times there and then if I were to hit
the reverse button here you can see the
extremely elevated rear camera moving
this thing around backing this up is uh
kind of hilarious I don't know if you've
ever tried with a 7t high maybe it's
like a 9ot high backup camera but then
you got your basic specs so in here is
the range I'm shooting this on a
different device than normal so let me
know if you notice that but 226 Mi of
range is 92% battery for this battery
size that's actually adjusted for the
cargo I have in the trunk so it knows
the payload again roughly 450 lbs here
it typically has a 275 to 300 mile
battery life but because I have that
payload it's gone okay you'll probably
actually get more like 245 to 255 LS and
that's reflected here which is cool but
then on the inside of course you're
going to know this is just a electric
power this is going to be a tachometer
that's your speedometer over there it's
it's real basic in here after that
you've got your basic knobs for volume
for media for temperature control for
fan control HVAC stuff there's even
missing buttons for other options that
could be here if you option them
although there is heated seats which I
like and that's about it for the
interior of the Sprinter not a whole lot
else going on of course a lot of people
have asked so yes this does have
adaptive cruise control yes these paddle
shifters do change between amounts of
regen so if I flip to drive right here
you can see that says D for drive and if
I were to hit the minus we go to D minus
which is
fullon not actually one pedal driving
but really heavy regen and then you can
go plus to go back to D or even D+ or
plus plus which is just straight
cruising with zero resistance no regen
and the other thing is what are the
drive modes so if you hit that drive
mode button you can see there's
basically Comfort Eco and max range max
range is really like trying to Maxim
like turning down your you can hear the
air conditioner just got a little
quieter like really maximizing what the
drivetrain can get you but in general
driving around and comfort totally fine
you know electric cars have started to
remind me of folding phones hear me out
just because I think folding phon so
I've talked about I've reviewed a lot of
folding phones and I think they'll get
to the Tipping Point of finally being
much more popular when and only when the
tech has caught up to the point where
when you're choosing a phone you can
just choose the folding version or the
non-folding version and there's no
tradeoffs it's just you want the folding
one is that better for you or the
non-folding one but right now the Tech's
not that good yet so a folding phone has
these trade-offs like first of all it's
almost always more expensive there's
more parts there's more uh less
durability there's not as much dust
resistance there are things that you
have to accept as downsides to get the
folding version but yeah someday maybe
there'll be the same price the same
amount of hopefully not that many moving
Parts there's no crease like there will
just be do you want the folding one or
not and then you get the benefits or you
get the benefits of the other and that's
how I feel like electric cars are also
advancing it's in the same way where
someday in the future the tech will be
good enough that electric cars are
either you just buy the electric car or
the non-electric version of the car and
it's just kind of whichever one is
better for you do you want the loud one
with gears do you like that you can get
the gas one do you want The Quiet One
maybe with more storage space or that's
smoother whatever or or less moving
parts and maintenance whatever get the
electric one it's up to you but the
Tech's not there yet so there are also
trade-offs and downsides like extra
weight the EV version is almost always
significantly more expensive than the
gas version and of course the range if
you ever want to do a road trip and have
a long way to go then you kind of you
typically prefer a gas version at least
to not have range anxiety this esprinter
is in a good spot where luckily most of
the tradeoffs let me uh it always wants
me to turn it off you actually don't
really have to think too hard about
these tradeoffs because it's an e it's a
sprinter this thing was big and heavy
anyway the electric version is roughly I
was looking on their website recently
it's like 7 or $8,000 more expensive
than the equivalent gas version like
this same Sprinter for gas is like 60
Grand versus 68 Grand when I looked it
up so yeah it's a bit more expensive but
I mean you're not doing road trips in
this you're just doing local delivery
and moving this around between a couple
different towns or counties or whatever
it is and hopefully range anxiety is not
an issue so really ideally you benefit
from this being quieter smoother and
potentially having more storage if you
know they were able to add more storage
from having the battery at the bottom
instead of the gas tank so I like this
thing man it's cool I think it's good in
neighborhoods it's quieter you're able
to hear the kids playing in their lawns
so you don't you know run them over or
something crazy I just think in general
this is one of the better types of
vehicles to go electric and that's
showcased by the fact that it looks and
feels exactly like the gas one just
happens to be
electric shout out to the cargo vans all
right that's just my thoughts thanks for
watching catch in the next one let me
know if you agree peace"
