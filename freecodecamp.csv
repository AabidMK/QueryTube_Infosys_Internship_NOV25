they want to be able to get a job as
quickly as possible as a software

>> Yeah. So do something every day even if
it's 10 minutes and stick with it. I did
in my journey to learn end up taking
some breaks for various reasons. You
know my learning took a course of over 3
years. It can be done in less than a
year if you stick with it. I really I
fully believe that that you can do it in
less than a year if you you know spend
time every day. If it's listening to 10
minutes of a podcast on your way to
work, if it's doing some leak code real
quick or doing the next module at free
code camp, just get in and do something
at least every day so that your mind
continues to grow. And those little
actions, they add up at the end of the
year. And I think that's the biggest
thing is to try to keep with it. Don't
overwhelm yourself and try to cram in 5
hours a day every day. You'll burn out.
Like, but try to do something every day
that keeps your mind active and keeps
your brain in the learning mode to be
able to expand your knowledge and
skills."

flexible and efficient one-dimensional
layouts for your websites. Learn all
about CSS Flexbox in this comprehensive
video course from Indra. Flexbox
transforms an ordinary container into a
flexible box where you can precisely
control its children known as flex
items. Flexbox operates along a single
line governed by the main axis row
column and the perpendicular crossaxis.
This powerful model simplifies complex
alignments, allowing items to grow to
fill space or shrink to prevent
overflow. By mastering just a handful of
properties like display, flex, justify
content, and align items, you can create
truly dynamic and responsive components
easily. Hello and welcome to the CSS
flexbox course. My name is Indra and I
will be your instructor for this course.
In this course, we will be learning all
about the CSS flexbox. So now let's
answer the most important question. What
exactly is CSS flexbox?
So the CSS flexbox is short for flexible
box layout. Okay, it's a CSS layout
model that simplifies creating complex
layouts. It provides a flexible way to
align elements and distribute the space
within a container element. Okay, we
will learn all about these things in
this video. The flexbox layout model is
birectional. This means you can either
arrange your elements in rows, columns
or both. Okay. So now what are the
benefits of using the CSS flexbox?
Before flexbox, it was hard to create
complex layouts and responsive web
pages. You needed a combination of the
CSS floats and position properties.
Also, you will occasionally need the
margins like the margin auto properties
as well so that you can create some sort
of a complex layout inside of CSS. And
this required many workarounds and hacks
basically. But with CSS flexbox, you can
now do the following with less
difficulty and fewer lines of code.
Align and center elements using
properties like justify content and
align items. Okay. Develop responsive
layouts without writing a lots of media
queries. Reorder elements without
changing the HTML structure which we
will definitely see. Create same height
columns without extra HTML elements or
background images. Okay. So these are
all of the benefits of using the CSS
flexbox. In short, by using CSS flexbox,
we can create complex layouts inside of
our HTML page without writing a ton of
CSS or without using some sort of hack
or workarounds. CSS flexbox makes us
easy to create the complex layouts
inside of HTML. Okay. All right. So what
I'll do next I will show some of the
examples where the CSS flexbox is being
used. So if I go to the browser as you
can see I will zoom in a little bit.
Okay. So this is the GitHub website. If
you are signed in you will never see
this page. But if you are not signed in
you will see this marketing page of
GitHub. So as you can see here this
navigation bar it is using the CSS
flexbox and in the later part of this
course we will build our own simple
navigation bar as well by using the CSS
flexbox. So to build navigation bars the
CSS flexbox is heavily used and this is
one of the common pattern which you will
find. Okay. So this navigation bar is
using the CSS flexbox. As you can see,
we have two groups of content here like
these elements here on the left and here
we have the search bar and then we have
the sign in and the sign up button on
the right side. Okay. And here we have
the logo as well. So these are the flex
elements and the navigation bar is the
flex container. Okay. If we just go a
little bit more, as you can see, there
are a bunch of things. We have these
images as well, we have all of the
content. As you can see here on the
right, we have some image and on the
left we have some content. Most probably
it is using the CSS flexbox as well.
Okay, let's move forward. As you can see
once again, we have some image on the
right and on the left we have some sort
of content. Most probably this is also
using the CSS flexbox.
Okay, once again we have three different
columns
and so on. We have two different columns
here. So these all of the things which
we have currently it is very easy to
create this sort of layout by using the
CSS flexbox. Okay, once again we have
another website. I'll just zoom in a
little bit. It is the data do website.
Okay. Once again, as you can see, this
website also uses the CSS flexbox quite
heavily. First of all, we have these two
buttons. As you can see, they are side
by side and they are inside of a flex
container and these two buttons are the
flex items. Once again, we have some of
the images as well and this is using the
CSS flexbox. Like before this video, I
have inspected that. Okay. And then we
have this layout as well. And once again
we have some images on the right. We
have some content on the left. We have
some content on the right. We have some
image on the left. And so on and so
forth. These sort of layout as you can
see these are some complex layouts but
by using the CSS flexbox we can create
these sort of layouts quite easily.
Okay. I hope that you have understood
like what exactly is CSS flexbox and
what are the benefits of using the CSS
flexbox.
Okay. Before moving forward in the
course, I would like to share with you
some resources which will be very very
helpful to learn about the CSS flexbox.
First of all, we have this blog post by
free code camp by this author whose name
is Benjamin Simma. Okay, I might have
pronounced his name incorrectly. So,
sorry for that. But this blog post is
quite helpful and this is one of the
best resource which I have found to
learn about the CSS flexbox. Okay. So,
this is called the CSS flexbox handbook.
complete guide with practical examples.
So you can search it online and also the
link of this blog post will be available
inside of the description below.
Next, one of the most useful websites
for the web developers is Mosilla
developer network. So this is one of the
closest thing which you will find as the
documentation of the CSS, HTML and
JavaScript basically right. So I will be
referring to this resources quite a lot
throughout this course. So first of all
we have this blog post and then we have
the Mosilla developer network. Okay.
Okay. So let's now set up our local
development environment. Okay. So in
this course we need a code editor and my
choice for the code editor is Visual
Studio Code or VS Code. Okay. You can
download the VS code editor from
code.visisualstudio.com.
And here we have the download button. If
you are using Windows, you can just
click on that. If you are using Mac OS,
then this download button will show like
download for Mac OS or something like
that. Okay. And then we need a browser.
My choice will be the Google Chrome
browser. Okay. So here is the Google
Chrome browser. you can just download
the Google Chrome browser. Okay. So this
is the local development environment
which we have. Okay. So now let's set up
the initial project to learn about the
CSS flexbox. So in my desktop I have a
folder called YouTube and inside of that
I'll create another folder called CSS
flexbox.
Okay. And then I will just drag and drop
inside of the VS code icon.
All right. So I have opened the folder.
So CSS flexbox. So otherwise if you are
not able to open the CSS flexbox folder
inside of VS code, you can just go to
file and then click on open folder. This
will open the file explorer. Okay. And
then you can just select this particular
folder and then click on select folder.
All right. So here what I'll do I'll
create the index.h HTML file.
Okay. And then I will just get rid of
that. Then I will do the exclamation
mark and hit enter. Tab. Tab. And then I
will just change the title to
CSS flexbox.
Okay. And inside of the body, I will
open up the H1 tag and then do something
like CSS
textbox. Okay.
Now, after that, I will create another
file called tiles dot CSS. Okay. And
inside of the HTML file, what I'll do,
I'll just go ahead here and do link and
dot /styles.css.
Okay. So to follow along inside of the
VS code, you want to have one extension
which is called live server.
Okay. So I'll just search for that. So
this is the extension. You can just
install the extension. There will be a
install button. I have already installed
the extension. That is why I am having
the uninstall button here. But you will
have something like this. Okay. So you
can just click on the install button and
it will be installed. Then after that
you have to go to the HTML file.
basically this file and here inside of
that you can see the go live button or
you can just right click and scroll down
a little bit and click on this open with
live server okay so what will happen
after that whenever we will make some
changes inside of our code it will
automatically reload the browser
okay I'll click on that and there we go
so I have opened this particular HTML
file file inside of the browser. Okay.
So, what I'll do, I'll just close up
some of the
browser tabs and go to my code editor
right now and I will add some basic
styles.
So I'll do margin of zero,
padding of zero, box sizing, not box
line, box sizing of border box, and font
family
to something like this one. Okay, you
can use anything.
All right. And for the H1, I can just do
text align to center and font size to
something like
uh 4m something like that. Okay. And
after that what I'll do is basically I
will just go ahead and move the browser
here on my second desktop and I'll close
the file explorer. Okay, I'll just close
that and there we go. So now we have
this particular CSS flexbox written out
here. Okay. And this is the browser
window which we will be using throughout
the course. Okay. So there we go. So
this is the basic setup of our course.
Okay. All right. Before writing some
code about the CSS flexbox, we have to
learn about some terminology.
Okay. And these terms we will be using
throughout our course. Okay. So how
flexbox works right? So we have some
items and these items are inside of a
container
and in order to turn that container a
flex container we have to set the
display property to flex or inline flex.
Okay. Once we have done that, this
container is now a flex container. And
all of the items which we have currently
right now are called the flex items. I
might call them boxes or something like
that. But the items which are inside of
a flex container are called the flex
items. And once we set the display
property to flex, we will have access to
many other CSS properties which we can
use such as align items, align content,
justify content and so on. Okay. So what
I'll do, I'll just go to the code editor
right now and I will set up some code.
First of all, I'll create a div of
container.
Okay. inside of the div I will create
another div. Okay, so dotbox with the
class name of box and time six. Okay.
All right. And inside of that I'll do
one then two then three then four then
five then six and each of the boxes will
have some unique classes as well. So
I'll do one then two then three
then
four
then five
and six.
Okay. All right. And here inside of the
CSS what I'll do? So here inside of the
CSS I will write some styles for the
container and for each of the boxes. So
container
and for the border I'll do 5 pixel
solid
and black.
Okay.
And I'll set a height
of 1,600 pixels,
width of 1,600 pixels. And for the time
being, what I'll do, I will just comment
out the height. This height, we will
need it later. Okay.
All right. And hit save. I think this is
enough for now. And for the boxes, what
I'll do, I'll just go ahead and do a
height of 200 pixels,
width of 200 pixels,
and
what I'll do, I'll set a border radius
of
something like 6 pixel. Okay?
And for each of the boxes, as you can
see, we have this 1 2 3 4 5 6. Okay. So,
let's go ahead and for each of the
unique boxes, I will have a unique
background color. Okay. So, dot one
background color. Let's do blue violet
for two.
Okay.
Background color. Let's do brown.
Okay.
Part three.
Background color. Let's do
something like this one. Cadet blue
for four.
Background color.
Let's do coral. Okay.
for five
background color. Let's do
cornflour blue. Okay.
And for six,
let's do the background color of
crimson.
All right. We have some unique colors
currently right now. Hit save and let's
see how that looks.
Okay, this is way too much zoomed in.
Okay,
so this is that
this is 100%. Now I do not like how that
is not centered and the text is quite
small. Okay, so what I'll do I'll do
margin.
Let's do top and bottom two rim left and
right auto.
Okay. And for each of the boxes.
Okay. I'll do a font.
Uh-huh. Size and do something like form.
Okay.
And do a text align to center.
All right. Now this thing looks better,
right?
Okay. So this is our initial setup for
the code. Now in order to turn the
container a flex container, what we have
to do? We have to go here. Okay.
Inside of this container, we have to set
the display to flex and hit save. And
now something different will happen.
Okay, this happens. So all of the
elements are lined up in one line. Okay.
So this happens and also I have given
the numbers right. So what is the
direction of our content? It is going
from left to right. And this will be
important when we will be learning about
the main and the crossaxis inside of the
flexbox. Okay.
So this is what happens.
Now what I can do after this display
flex I can set justify content to center
it's save and if I do that then all of
the elements are now currently centered
and why I can do that because I have set
the display property to flex. If I just
comment this thing out and hit save now
nothing happens right because we have
display set to flex that is why this
container is now a flex container and
that is why the CSS property justify
content is available to us and in case
if you are wondering what are the other
CSS properties which are available I can
show it to you Okay, I have opened this
page on MDN which is for CSS flexible
box layout and inside of that if I just
scroll down a little bit then we have
many of the properties which are
available such as align content, align
items, align self, flex, flex basis,
flex direction, flex flow, flex grow,
flex shrink, flex wrap, justify content.
So we have just seen a glimpse of the
justify content but don't worry we will
discuss the justify content and the
other properties as well in detail in
this course. Okay before moving forward
we have to learn about a little bit more
terminologies.
So we have to learn about the concept of
main axis and cross-axis inside of CSS
flexbox. So what exactly is the main
axis and how it is determined? So the
main axis is determined by default by
the direction of the content in which
direction the content is flowing. So
currently in our example if we go here
inside of the CSS flexbox example so our
content is flowing from left to right.
That is why we are having this numbers 1
2 3 4 5 6. Okay. All right. So if that
is the case then this is our main axis
and the crossaxis will be the
perpendicular to the main axis. So if
the main axis is going from left to
right then the crossaxis inside of the
flexbox will go from top to bottom. Now
you might be thinking okay so the main
axis is the x-axis and the crossaxis is
the y-axis. But you have to keep in mind
it is not quite simple. So because we
can change the main and the crossaxis
and also we can change the direction of
the main and the crossaxis as well. So
currently the main axis is going from
left to right. But by using the flex
direction CSS property we can change the
direction to right to left as well. So
if I just do something like this, we can
change it something like this as well.
Okay. So we are currently not doing that
yet. We will do that in the upcoming
section. Okay.
So this is how the main and the
crossaxis is determined. Now I want to
go to this blog post as well. As you can
see this blog post inside of the
pre-code camp has described the main and
the crossaxis quite well. Okay, with
some examples as well. But I will go to
the MDN documentation as well. And
inside of that as you can see it is
saying like the main axis in flexbox is
defined by the direction set by the flex
direction CSS property. Okay. And there
are four possible values for the flex
direction which are row row reverse
column and column reverse. And once
again for the crossaxis it is saying the
crossaxis in flexbox runs perpendicular
to the main axis. Therefore, if your
flex direction is either row or row
reverse, then the crossaxis runs down
the columns. Okay. So, basically it is
saying like hey cross-axis is the axis
which is perpendicular to the main axis
and the main axis is determined by the
direction of the content. Now, because
we are using English then our content is
flowing from left to right. But if you
are using some sort of a language
something like Hebrew which is written
from right to left then the direction of
the content is from right to left then
the main axis will be from right to
left. Okay. But we are not complicating
the things that much currently. Right
now we are using English and we will be
using English throughout this course so
that our calculation of the main and the
crossaxis remains simple. Okay. So this
is the main and the cross-axis. Next we
will learn about the flex direction CSS
property. Okay. Before learning about
the flex direction CSS property, one
thing which I like to discuss is the
difference between the display flex and
display inline flex. Okay. So what I
will do here currently right now inside
of this code inside of the HTML I'll
create an anchor tag and this will go
nowhere and it will say click me
okay and I will just copy that after the
container I will paste the anchored
element okay and here inside of the CSS
temporarily I will just add the anchor
anchor element and pond size to two ram.
Okay, hit save and go to the browser. So
currently as you can see this is our
anchor elements, right? And one thing to
point out here is that our container is
a block level element. It is not a
inline element like the anchor elements,
right? But we can change that behavior
as well. So if we go here, currently we
are setting the display to display flex.
But if we set the display to inline
flex, okay, hit save. And now our flex
container has become an inline element.
Okay, but apart from that there are no
differences. So if we want to convert
our container to an inline element but
we also want to use the flex properties
then we can set the display property to
inline flex. Otherwise if we want to
convert our container to just a block
level element which it was by default
because our container is a div right and
div is a block level element. So in that
case we will use the normal display to
flex. Okay, I hope that makes sense and
you have understood the differences
between the flex and the inline flex.
All right, now we will learn about the
flex direction CSS property. By using
the flex direction CSS property, we can
control the direction of the main axis.
Currently in this diagram, the main axis
is going from left to right, which is by
default it is doing right. But it can go
from right to left. It can go from top
to bottom or it can go from bottom to
top. So let's go to the documentation on
MDN or also inside of this blog post as
well. So the flex direction property
defines the direction for displaying the
flex items. It is what sets the flex
container main axis. This property can
take any of these values like row,
column, row, reverse or column reverse.
Also, let's go to the MDN documentation
and let's see what it is saying. The
flex direction CSS property sets how
flex items are placed in the flex
container defining the main axis and the
direction normal or reversed. Okay. And
here we have all of the values which the
flex direction can take. Okay. So
currently our application is looking
something like this. Okay. So what I'll
do I'll go to the code.
Mhm. And I'll get rid of these anchor
elements. It was just to show the
differences between the flex and the
inline flex. Okay. Hit save. And inside
of this container,
I'll just get rid of the justify
content. Okay. And now if I just save
and go to the browser as you can see
this happens. So this is by default
using the flex. Okay. And the container
is the flex container. And as you can
see by this numbering our content is
going from left to right. Okay. Because
we are using English. All right.
Now what we can do we can set the flex
direction
and then we can set it to row and this
is the default value by the way. Okay.
Now as you can see nothing is changed.
But now what we can do we can set the
value of the flex direction to row
reverse as well. So if we do that then
as you can see all of the elements are
now stacked in the right and please
remember the direction of the content.
Previously it was from left to right.
Now the content is going from right to
left. Why is that? Because the numbering
is going from 1 2 3 4 5 6. It is going
from right to left. Okay.
So now what is happening our main axis?
Okay. Let me just go to the Xcali draw
once again. So currently our main axis
is not this one. It was previously but
our main axis is currently looking
something like this. Okay. So I'll just
do something like this. Okay. So this is
our main axis. So the direction is right
to left because we are using the flex
direction to row reverse. Okay, now
let's just go to the code. Then this
flex direction can take another property
which is column.
Okay, hit save. Now everything is in one
column. And what is the direction of our
content? The direction of the content is
from top to bottom because of this
numbering basically. So 1 2 3 4 5 6.
Okay. So what happened currently right
now? So now our main axis I'll just
Mhm.
Okay. It was previously our main axis.
Now what is happening? Our main axis is
going from top to bottom. Okay.
I hope that makes sense. And the
crossaxis is left to right. Okay. And if
we go to the code once again then we
have another value which is column
reverse. If we set that and go to the
browser, as you can see now our content
is going from bottom to top. Okay. So
what is happening currently right now?
Our main axis which is here which was
previously going from top to bottom now
it will be something like this.
Okay.
So now our main axis is this one. I hope
that makes sense. So by using the flex
direction CSS property, we can control
the direction of the main axis. Okay, I
hope that makes sense. And yes, by using
the flex direction property, we can
control the direction of the content as
well by changing the main axis. So what
I'll do, I'll just get rid of that and I
will just set the flex direction to row
which was by default. Okay. So here it
is. Okay. Now we will be learning the
flex wrap CSS property. Okay. So as you
can see our container has a width of
1,600 pixel and the height which is
commented out which is also 1,600
pixels. Okay. Now we have the display
set to flex and the flex direction set
to row. And here what I'll do I will
increase the width of the individual
boxes to 400 pixels. Okay. So we have
six boxes. So 6 * 400 pixels that will
be equals to 2400 pixels. So because we
have set the flex direction to row that
is why I can think of like hey all of
the boxes will not fit inside of a
single row right because it is
overflowing. Right? We have this width
set to 1,600 pixels and all of the width
combined with all of the boxes is 2400
pixels. Okay, so let's see what happens
if I just save that and go to the
browser and go here. As you can see, all
of the boxes are fitting inside of a
single row. And what exactly is
happening here? So if I just open the
dev tools and just inspect one of the
boxes, as you can see the width of each
of the elements, each of the boxes is
265 pixels instead of the 400 pixel
which I have set inside of the code. So
what exactly is happening? So what is
happening here is that all of the items
like the flex items are shrinking down
in the same amount so that they can fit
inside of the container in a single row.
And when we will be learning about the
flex shrink property then we will see
more of this shrinking property in
action. But currently right now just
remember like hey if we are overflowing
the content inside of a flex container
then all of the flex item will shrink
down and it will fit inside of a single
row. But we can change this behavior.
Okay. So if we want like hey all of the
elements should have the 400 pixels of
width and all of the extra elements
should wrap inside of the second or the
third line
we can use the flex wrap to do so. So if
I just go here inside of this blog post
as you can see uh we have some
explanation or we can go to the MDN and
see the description of the flex wrap CSS
property. The flex wrap CSS property
sets whether flex items are forced onto
one line or can wrap onto multiple
lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets
the direction that lines are stacked.
Okay.
And here as you can see the default
value of the flex wrap is no wrap. Then
it can wrap or we have another value
which is wrap reverse. We will see all
of this in this video. So let's go to
the browser and do
wrap
and set it to no wrap. Okay. and save.
As you can see, nothing happens. And
because this is the default behavior.
But here if we set this value to wrap
and hit save.
Now as you can see all of the elements
have the 400 pixels of width and the
extra elements which was not fitting
inside of this particular container is
now wrapped onto a separate row. Okay,
if we have more elements then it will
wrap into separate rows as well. So I
can show it to you if I just
copy this one a bit bunch of times and
hit save.
As you can see we have multiple rows
here. So I will not do that. I will just
get rid of that. Okay.
So as you can see now flex wrap is
working. Okay.
Then we can have here
we have this wrap. So if we set the flex
direction to column, we can have the
wrapping inside of the column layout as
well. So what I'll do, I'll just do no
wrap for now for the flex wrap. And I
will increase the height to 400 pixels.
And now if I just save that and go here
as you can see. Okay. All right.
So I'll do flex direction to column. And
also I will uncomment this height
because if I do not uncomment this
height what will happen the height of
the container will grow to accommodate
the all of the elements which are inside
of the container. So I'll just have a
fixed height and hit save. Now as you
can see all of the elements have the
height of 265 pixel instead of 400
pixels. It is doing the same thing
because we have flex wrap set to no
wrap. But if I just set the flex wrap to
wrap.
Okay. And hit save. Now as you can see
we have a second column. Okay. We have a
second column here. And also please
remember what is the main axis? Main
axis is going from top to bottom. So 1 2
3 4 5 6. And the crossaxis is going from
left to right. And that is why this
particular column is on the right side.
Okay.
So if I just set it to row once again
and hit save. Now as you can see 1 2 3
and then we have 4 5 6. Okay. So the
main axis is going from left to right
and the crossaxis is going from top to
bottom. Okay. I hope that makes sense.
All right. And in case if you are
wondering about this space which is in
between the columns and the rows and
also here as well we will see how to
control the space in the upcoming
sections. Okay. All right. So this is
how we can have the flex wrap. Now
we can do something like row reverse as
well. So let's see what happens. So if I
do set the flex direction to row reverse
and the flex wrap is set to wrap then
this will happen. So our main axis will
go from right to left. Okay. And the
crossaxis is also top to bottom. So main
axis is going from right to left and the
crossaxis is top to bottom. That is why
the new row which is happening here it
is at the bottom. Okay. Now we can just
go here and just uh do something like
row. Now we can do something like column
as well for the flex direction. So
currently the main axis is going from
top to bottom and the cross axis is
going from left to right. That is why
the new column is at the right side.
Okay. Now what we can do? We can do
something like column reverse as well.
If we do that then as you can see the
main axis is going from bottom to top
currently right now and the crossaxis is
left to right. Okay. And that is why
this column is currently on the right
side.
So I will get back to the row layout
currently row and we will discuss the
third value which the flex wrap can take
which is wrap reverse. Okay. So if I
just do something like this as you can
see. So we are having the flex direction
set to row and the flex wrap set to
wrap. Okay. And that is why what is
happening the new row which is forming
here because all of the elements cannot
fit inside of a single row. It is on the
bottom. So the new row is at the bottom.
So now if we do something like wrap
reverse
hit save.
Now what happens is that this is the
first row 1 2 3 and the new row is at
the top of the previous row. Basically
the first row. Okay.
So this is how we can change the
direction of the newly created row or
the column. So I know this is a little
bit confusing but if we just do
something like row reverse
then this will happen. So what is
happening here? So we are setting the
flex direction to row reverse. That is
why the main axis direction is right to
left. Okay. So 1 2 3 4 5 6 and we have
set the flex wrap to wrap reverse. That
is why the newly created row because of
the flex is now on top of the previous
row or the first row. Okay.
So we can do something like this or we
can do the row reverse and then we can
do something like column. So if I set
the flex direction to column and the
flex wrap to wrap this will happen. So
the main axis direction is from top to
bottom and the crossaxis direction is
left to right. Okay, that is why the
newly created column which is here, it
is on the right side. Okay,
now if we do something like wrap
reverse, then what will happen? Can you
guess? So the newly created column will
be at the left side and this is the old
column or the previous column, right?
And if this is not confusing enough, we
can do something like column reverse and
hit save. And now the main axis
direction is from bottom to top and the
crossaxis direction is from right to
left. All right. So this is the flex
wrap CSS property. So before moving
forward, what I'll do? I'll set this
flex direction to row and the flex wrap
to just wrap.
Okay. All right. So now let's learn
about the flex flow CSS property. So
let's go to the MDN documentation.
So the flex flow CSS shorthand property
specifies the direction of a flex
container as well as its wrapping
behavior.
So as you can see we have learned about
the flex direction and the flex wrap CSS
property right. So it is the shorthand
property for these two. As you can see
inside of the constituent properties we
have the flex direction and then we have
the flex wrap.
Okay. So the flex flow property can take
one single value row row reverse column
and column reverse. If we set these
values then it will indicate the flex
direction property then it can have no
wrap wrap or wrap reverse. So if we set
these values then it will indicate the
flex wrap properties right and then it
can have two different values as well.
The first value indicates the flex
direction and the second value indicates
the flex wrap. Okay. All right. So what
I can do here inside of the code, I can
just comment this thing out. And
I can do something like flex flow. Okay.
And now the first value will indicate
the flex direction. Okay. So what I can
do? I can do something like row.
Something like that. And if I do that
and go to my code, as you can see the
flex direction is being set to row.
Okay. Then I can do column.
Okay. Now the flex direction is set to
column.
Okay. I can do something like row
reverse.
So it is setting the flex direction to
row reverse. And then I can do
column reverse as well. And this is
setting the flex direction to column
reverse. Okay. then I can do something
like wrap. Okay, if I do that then this
will happen. The plex wrap will set to
wrap. So now as you can see our content
is being wrapped around inside of the
flex container. Okay. And I can set
something like no wrap.
If I do that then wrapping is disabled.
Right. And then we can do something like
wrap reverse as well. If we do that then
the flex wrap is set to wrap reverse.
Okay.
So now this flex flow can take two
different values as well. So the first
value will be for the plex direction and
the second value will be for the flex
wrap. Okay. So what I can do I can set
the
flex direction to row and flex wrap to
wrap. Okay, just like these two lines.
Okay, so basically we can do the same
thing as these two lines are doing
inside of a single line by using the
flex flow CSS shorthand property. Okay.
So, I'll just comment this thing out and
hit save. And as you can see right now,
our flex direction is row and flex wrap
is set to wrap. I can set the flex
direction to column. Okay. So then our
flex direction is set to column and flex
wrap is set to wrap. We can do something
like wrap reverse as well. Okay.
So this is what happens. So the first
value for the flex flow is indicating
the flex direction and the second value
inside of the flex flow is indicating
the flex wrap. Okay. So what I'll do
I'll just get rid of that and I will
just do something like column reverse
and wrap. So if I do that then this will
happen which is expected right? We have
seen the main axis is going from bottom
to top and the cross-axis is going from
left to right. Okay.
So what I'll do I'll just get rid of
that and I will just set the flex
direction to row and the flex wrap to
wrap. Okay. All right. So this is the
flex blow CSS shorthand property.
All right. Now we will learn about the
justify content CSS property. Before
doing so, what I'll do? I'll just
comment out the flex flow. I'll
uncomment that and only comment out the
flex wrap. And we have these ones. So
let me just decrease the height and the
width. Okay. So that is there and that
is there. So we have 200 pixels of
height and the width. Hit save and okay.
All right. And for the height, I'll
comment that thing out as well for now.
So, as you can see, there we go. This is
the default behavior which we want.
Okay. The flex direction is set to row
and we have the six elements with 200
pixels of width. Okay. All right. So now
let's go to the justify content
documentation and see the justify
content CSS property defines how the
browser distributes space between and
around content items along the main axis
of a flex container and the inline axis
of a grid or multiol containers. We are
not talking about grid right now. We are
talking about flexbox. Okay. So this is
important. So the justify content CSS
property basically determines how the
space will be distributed among the flex
items in the main axis. Okay. So as you
can see we have some of the space and by
default the justify content has the
value of flex start. Okay. So what I'll
do I'll go here
and inside of the container I will do
justify content
and
do flex start and this is the default
value as you can see nothing happens.
Okay. And
please remember the direction of our
content. Okay. The direction is from
left to right. 1 2 3 4 5 6. Okay. And
all of the space is at the right side
which is left over space. Right. Now we
can do something like flex end as well.
If I do that then as you can see all of
the content is now pushed in the right
side and all of the leftover space is
now on the left side. Okay. Now you
might be thinking like hey I can do
something similar with the flex
direction property as well. Okay. So if
I just get rid of that.
Okay.
and do flex direction to row reverse
then
this will happen right all of the
content is now at the right side but
there is a distinct difference because
as you can see the direction of the
content is changed so currently one is
at the right side so 1 2 3 4 5 6 but if
we do the flex direction to something
like row and we will uncomment the
justify content to flex end then as you
can see the direction of our content is
preserved. Okay, it is not changed and
all of the content is at the right side
currently right now and all of the
leftover space is at the left side.
Okay, then we have some different values
as well. So we can have the space
between space around and space evenly.
We will see all of this in action. So
first of all let's see the space
between. So justify content to space
between hit save.
Now as you can see all of these elements
are now at the right edge and the left
edge and all of the leftover space is
now equally distributed between all of
the flex elements. Okay.
So this is what space between does. So
it distributes all of the space between
all of the elements and our first and
the last element here is at the edge.
There is no space between the border and
our elements. Okay. All right. Then we
can have something like space around.
Okay. Hit save.
Now as you can see what is happening.
All of the space which we had previously
is now distributed equally around
the main axis of each of the flex items.
So on the left side of the first item we
have some space. On the right side of
the first item we have some space. On
the left side of the second item we have
some space. On the right side of the
second item we have some space and so
on. Okay. As you can see at the last
element we have some space on the left
side and we have some space on the right
side. Then we have the just by content
to space evenly. So if we do that it is
similar to space around but there is the
difference.
So as you can see there is some space
between the border and this particular
first element but all of the space here
now are equal. So this space between the
border and the first element is equal to
the space between the first element and
the second element and so on. And also
there is the equal amount of space
between the last element and the border
as well. Okay. So this is the
space evenly. Okay. Then all of the
things which we have seen we can do
inside of the flex direction to column
as well. So if I do column and I will
just uncomment the height and do
something like flex start to start with.
So this is what it looks. Okay.
So all of the elements are now at the
top edge and it is going from top to
bottom. Okay. Then what we can do? We
can do flex end as well. Okay. If we do
that now this will happen all of the
elements are now at the bottom right.
There is no space at the bottom and all
of the free space is at the top. Why is
that? Because the main axis is going
from top to bottom. Okay.
Then we can do justify content to space
around or space between first. Okay.
Space between. Then we have no space
between the border and the first element
and the border and the last element. But
all of the space is now distributed
equally between all of the elements.
Okay.
Then we can do space around.
Okay, if we do that then on the top of
the first element we have some space on
the bottom of the first element we have
some space on the top of the second
element we have some space at the bottom
of the second element we have some space
and so on and we have some space on the
top of the last element and we have some
space on the bottom of the last element
okay then we can do something like space
evenly
then you know what will happen all of
the space will become equal. So this
space between the border and the first
element is equal to the space between
the first element and the second element
and so on. Okay. All right. So this is
how we use the justify content. Now what
I'll do I will enable the wrap
and I will do the flex direction to row.
Okay. And I will make
these elements of something like 500
pixels of width not the height. Okay.
The height should be 200 pixel and the
width should be 500 pixels. Okay. All
right. If I do that then as you can see
we have two different
rows currently right now and we have the
wrapping and for each of the rows we are
having equal amount of space between all
of the elements and the border. Why is
that? Because we have justify content to
space evenly. We can do something like
flex start. Okay. And so on. All right.
So one of the other values which justify
content can have is the value of center.
Okay. And this is very very helpful if
we want to center the elements along the
main axis of the flex container. Okay.
If we do that now everything is at the
center and the leftover space which we
had previously is now distributed at the
left and the right. Okay.
So this is how justify content center
works. And if we do flex direction to
column, hit save. Now we have the
justify content set to center. That is
why we have some space at the top. We
have some space at the bottom. And all
of the content is now centered along the
main axis. Okay. So in this way we can
center the elements along the main axis.
And we can do that quite easily as well.
If I just comment out all of these
elements and we will have only one
element. So this element is now
perfectly centered vertically. And if we
just set the flex direction to row then
this element will be perfectly centered
horizontally. Okay. All right. So now
what we can do as well we can turn on
the flex wrap. So I can do something
like flex wrap to wrap and I can set the
width to something like 450 pixels.
Okay, hit save.
Now we have the justify content set to
center and that is why it is happening.
Right? So all of the elements
are now wrapped. The elements are
wrapped inside of a separate rows.
Right? And each of the rows have justifi
content set to center. Okay. That is why
there is some space at the start of the
second row and there is some space at
the end of the second row. All right.
Okay. So we can do something like flex
start as well. If we do that this will
happen. Okay. Then we can do flex end.
Okay. So this will happen. So everything
is now at the right side. We can do
space
space between. So each of the rows will
follow the space between rule for the
justify content. Okay. Then we can do
space around.
So each of the element will have equal
amount of space around them right. So on
the left and the right. Okay. And also
we can do something like space evenly.
Okay. If we do that this will happen. So
equal amount of space between the border
and the first element and the rest of
the elements and at last here as well at
the uh between the last element and the
border. And same goes for the second
row. Okay. Now we can do something like
flex direction to column and we can set
the height to 450 as well.
Okay. All right. So if we do that then
this will happen. So we have multiple
columns and each of the columns will
follow the justify content value as
well. So currently it is set to space
evenly. So what I can do? I can do flex
start.
Hit save. So this will happen. Okay.
Then I can do flex end. So all of the
elements are now at the bottom. Okay.
For the first column and the second
column. Then we can do space between.
So for each of the columns there is no
gap between the border and the first
element here. For this one and for this
one as well. And all of the space for
each column is now equally distributed
between all of the elements. Okay. Then
we can do space between. We can do space
evenly as well. Okay. So as you can see
even amount of space between the border
and the first element and between the
first element and the second element and
so on. Okay. And then we can do space
around as well. Okay. So this will
happen. So equal amount of space on the
top and the bottom for each of the
elements here.
All right. So this is basically the
justify content CSS property.
All right. Now we will learn about the
align items CSS property. So to do so,
I'll do the justify content to center.
And I will just get rid of this and set
it to 200 pixels of height and 200
pixels of width. Hit save and go to the
browser. Okay. So that is column
currently right now. So set it to row
and hit save. So now that is what it is.
Okay. Now if we go to this blog post
here it is described quite easily here.
The align items property handles the
alignment of flex items on the crossaxis
of the flex container. It can take any
of these values which we will see. Okay.
And here in the MDN documentation what
it is saying. So the CSS align items
property sets the align self value on
all direct children as a group. We will
learn about the align self property in a
bit. Okay. In flexbox it controls the
alignment of the items on the crossaxis.
Okay. And in grid layout it controls the
alignment of the items on the block axis
within their grid areas. So we are
currently learning about flexbox. So we
have to worry about this particular line
like it controls the alignment of the
items on the crossaxis.
Okay. All right. So what I'll do I'll go
here and what I'll do I'll just comment
out the height for these elements. Okay.
For the boxes. So what do you think
happens?
This is a little bit tricky one because
this will happen because the by default
align items property value is set to
stretch. So I can show it to you as
well. So if I go here and do align items
and set to stretch.
Okay, hit it. Now this is what happens.
But if we set the height manually then
the flex box respects the height. Okay.
So now it is 200 pixels. Okay.
Then we can have the flex start as well.
If we do that then what will happen? So
what exactly is our main axis? Our main
axis is going from left to right. What
is our crossaxis? Our crossaxis is going
from top to bottom. So flex start will
align all of the items on the top.
Okay. Then we can do something like flex
end as well. If we do that then all of
the elements will align to the end of
the crossaxis.
Okay.
All right. Then what I'll do? I'll do
something like stretch which is the
default value.
And I will do the flex direction. I will
set it to column.
Okay. Hit save. And I will just get rid
of the width.
So what do you think happens? So this
will happen because by default the align
items value is set to stretch. Okay. So
this happens. So we can do something
like flex start as well. If we do that
and if we just make this width
available.
So this will happen. So our main axis is
now going from top to bottom. Our
crossaxis from left to right.
Then we can do flex end as well. Okay.
If we do that then this will happen.
Okay. All right.
Then we have the most important thing
which is called center. Okay. We can
have it to the center as well. If we do
that then all of the elements will be
centered. And if we just do something
like flex direction to row as well
the row will be centered. Okay. So in
this way by using the justify content
and align items we can center an element
inside of a flex container. Okay. Also I
can show it to you if I just comment out
all of the elements here. So now this
particular element is centered perfectly
horizontally and vertically. And this is
regardless of the size because if I just
make the width uh something like
2,000 pixels
then this element is also centered. So
it is independent of the width and the
height of the container. Okay. So I'll
just add it to 1,600 pixels.
Okay. So we can do that. And also we can
set the flex direction to column as
well. Okay, if we do that. So, okay,
there is only one element. So, I'll just
uncomment these things. Mhm.
All right. And we have the flex wrap set
to wrap. Right. So if I just
decrease the width to or the height
basically to something like 800 pixels
something like that then this will
happen and
if we do
something like align items to flex
start. Mhm. Then this will happen. So
why it is happening? So we are having
the flex wrap set to wrap. That is why
our content is wrapping into another
column and we have set the align items
to flex start. So what is our main axis?
Our main axis is going from top to
bottom. What is our crossaxis? Our
crossaxis is going from left to right.
So this particular column is at the
start of the container and this
particular column is at the start at the
middle. Right? So this particular column
is starting from the middle. So that is
what is happening. Okay. Then we can do
something like flex end as well. So if
we do that this will happen. So this
particular column will end at the
middle. So what you can think of like
our container is divided into two
different parts. You can think of like
that. And each of the part is now
independently
controlled by the justify content and
the align items properties. Okay. So all
right. So this is line items CSS
property. All right. So now we will
learn about the align content CSS
property. Okay. So to do so what I'll do
I'll set the align items to center and
we have to turn on the flex wrap in
order to work with the align content CSS
property. Okay. And also I'll do flex
direction to row. Okay. Now I will set
the height of the container to 800
pixels and the width of the container to
800 pixels as well. Okay. All right. So
now this happens right. So everything is
centered right now. So now here we are
having two different rows. Okay. So how
we can control the space between and
around these rows? We can control the
space between and around these rows by
using the align content CSS property.
Okay. So if I go to the blog post here
by free codec cam. So when you have a
flex container with wrap. Okay. As I
have mentioned or more than one flex
line you may need to align the lines to
distribute the space as you want. Right?
That is when you use align content. And
here on the MDN it is saying the CSS
align content property sets the
distribution of the space between and
around content items along the flexboxes
crossaxis
or a grid or block level elements block
axis. Now in order to use the align
content CSS property, we have to turn on
the flex wrap which we did right we are
setting the flex wrap to wrap and we
have two different
rows currently right now. So now what I
can do I can go here and do align
content and we can do something like
flex start.
If we do that
now what happens is all of the space
which was on the top of the rows in
between of the rows and on the bottom of
the rows is now at the bottom. Okay. So
then we can do something like flex end
as well. If we do that then all of the
space is now at the top. Okay. Then we
can do something like center. If we do
that, you might have guessed everything
will be at the center. Now all of the
elements are at the center and all of
the space which we had previously is now
distributed at the top and the bottom.
Okay.
Then we can do something like space
between and this works similarly as the
justify content works. Right? So as you
can see these rows which we have now one
of the rows is at the top and one of the
rows is at the bottom and all of the
space is in between. Okay then we can do
space around as well. If we do that then
we have some space on the top. We have
some space on the bottom of the first
row and then once again we have some
space on the top and we have some space
at the bottom of the second row. And
then we can do something like space
evenly. Okay, if we do that then all of
the space are now even. So between the
border and the first row the space and
between the first row and the second row
the space is now equal. Okay. All right.
Then what we can do? We can set the flex
direction to column as well. If we do
that then now we are having the main
axis currently from top to bottom and
the crossaxis to left to right and that
is why we have two different columns.
Okay. Now we can do something like flex
start. Okay. If we do that then
everything is at the left side.
Then we can do something like flex end.
If we do that then everything is at the
right side. Then we can do something
like center.
Now everything is at the center. All of
the columns right is at the center. Then
we can do space between. Hit save. Now
all of the space is now in between the
two columns. Then we can do space evenly
or space around. Okay. We can do space
around. Then we have equal amount of
space at the left side of the first
column and the right side of the first
column. And then once again we have
equal amount of space at the left side
of the second column and the right side
of the second column. And then we can do
something like space evenly.
Hit save. Now all of the space is even.
So between the border and the first
column and in between the columns and in
between the second column and the
border. Okay. All of the space are same.
So what I'll do I'll do align content to
center. So everything will be centered.
And also what I'll do I'll just reset
the flex direction to row. Okay. All
right. So this is the align content CSS
property. All right. So now we will
learn about the place content CSS
shorthand property. Okay. If we go to
the browser and inside of the
documentation at MDN. So the place
content CSS shorthand property allows
you to align content along both the
block and inline directions at once.
That is the align content and justify
content properties. Okay. in a relevant
layout system such as grid or flexbox
and then if we go here so we have the
constituent properties where we have the
align content and justify content. All
right then if we go to the blog post as
well on free codec can cam. So as you
can see if you need to use both the
justify content and align content
properties you use the place content CSS
shorthand property. It can take one or
two values. When you give it a single
value, the browser will apply the same
value for the justify content and align
content.
And when you give two values for place
content, then the first value will be
for align content and the second value
will be for justify content. Okay. So
what I'll do, I will just show you this
particular example which it is showing
currently here. So we have set in the
first example we have set the align
content to flex end and justify content
to flex start and [snorts] then in the
second example we are using the place
content CSS property. Okay. So currently
our elements are looking something like
this. Okay.
Because we have the justify content set
to center and align content set to
center. So if I just get rid of that and
save. Now this is happening. So what
I'll do, I'll go here and do something
like place content
and I can just do something like center.
Okay, hit it. So we are putting only one
value here. So the justify content value
will be center and align content value
will be center. If I do that then once
again this happens and this is expected.
Right? Now for example we want to set
the align content to flex start
and the justify content to center. So if
I do that hit save now as you can see
the justify content is set to centered
and the align content is set to uh flex
start. Okay we can do something like
flex end as well.
If we do that then this happens which is
expected. So the align content value is
flex end and justify content value is
center. So we can do something like flex
start as well.
If we do that then the align content
value will be flex end and justify
content value will be flex start. So if
I do that then this happens. So as you
can see whenever you want to use the
justify content and align content values
together you can use the place content
CSS shorthand property instead of the
two CSS properties and also if I hover
over here inside of VS code as you can
see it is saying the syntax the first
value is for the align content and the
second value is for the justify content.
Okay. So whenever we want to use the
align content and justify content values
together instead of writing these two
properties, we can use only single one
property which is place content and we
can provide the align content and
justify content values inside of the
place content property. Okay. So what
I'll do I'll just get rid of that and I
will just uncomment these two lines.
Okay. Until now we have been working
with the CSS properties which are mainly
linked with the flex container right. So
that is why we have been writing all of
the CSS properties inside of the
container class. But from now on we will
be working with the properties which are
more of the flex item level. Right? So
these CSS properties are applicable to
the flex items. Okay. And we will start
with the align self CSS property. So
if I go here and I can just search for
align self. Okay, here as well. And also
inside of the blog post I'll go here and
we have this align self CSS property.
Okay. All right. So the align self CSS
property overrides a grid of flex items
align items value. So basically the
align self and the align items
properties work in the same way. But the
align items CSS property is for all of
the elements inside of a flex container.
But the align self CSS property works
for only one flex item. Okay. In grid it
aligns the items inside the grid area.
In flexbox, it aligns the items on the
crossaxis. Okay. So, let's go to the
blog post as well. So, you can use the
align cell property to give a flex item
a different alignment from the other
items. Okay. So, it works in the same
way as align items property. The
difference is that whereas align items
applies to all of the flex items, the
align cell property is applied to only
specific items. Okay. So what I'll do,
I'll go here and first of all what I'll
do, I'll comment out the align content
here. I'll comment out the flex wrap.
And for the height, I'll do 1,000. For
the width, I'll do 1,600.
Okay. All right. And what I'll do, I'll
just comment out these two
boxes here inside of the HTML and do the
flex direction to row. Okay. Everything
is good. All right. So now this is what
happens. Okay. So we have the align
items set to flex start. So what we can
do? We can do something like center.
Okay. If I do that then our elements are
horizontally and vertically centered
inside of the container. Okay. So now
for example what I want I want to move
this third box. So I want to move this
third box to the top. So how I can do
that? So what exactly is our main axis?
The main axis is going from left to
right. What is our crossaxis? It is
going from top to bottom. So if I want
to move this third element to the top,
then I have to apply the align cell
property and set it to flex start. Okay.
So if I just go here. So for this third
element I can do something like align
self and set it to flex start. Okay, hit
save. Now as you can see it is now
overwriting the align items CSS
property. Okay, and our element is at
the top. So we can move it at the bottom
as well. So flex end. If I do that then
it is at the end or we can do something
like center.
If I do that then it is at the center.
Okay. So if I just go here. So here what
I can do I can set the align items to
flex start for all of the items. So
everything is now at the start like the
flex start is applied but we have this
element which has the aligned self to
center that is why it is at the center
okay so what I'll do I'll do center
okay all right and then what we can do
here
go here and we can set the align self
value to stretch as well
so if I set the align self value to
stretch Now this happens. Now it is not
stretching across the whole height. So
why is that? Because it has a specific
height here, right? So we have for all
of the boxes have a specific height
which is 200 pixels. So what we can do
here, we can just set the height to
something like auto. If we do that, then
now this element is stretching the full
height. Okay, but I will just get rid of
the height and I will just make it to
center. Okay, let's save. Now everything
is at centered.
Now this is for the flex direction to
set to row, right? So if I just set the
flex direction to column here. So flex
direction to column. If I set it to
that, then we have a column. So now what
I want is I want to move all of the
elements at the left edge of the
container. So how I can do that? So what
is our main axis? Our main axis is going
from top to bottom. What is our
crossaxis? It is going from left to
right. Okay. So what I can do? I can set
the align items to flex start. Okay. If
I do that then all of the elements are
here at the left edge except for the
third element because it has the align
cell property set to center. Okay. So I
can do
something like flex start as well. If I
do that now it is at the left edge. I
can do flex end as well. Now it will be
at the right edge. Okay. Or I can do
something like
mhm center. So it will be at the center.
Or I can do something like stretch.
If I do that then nothing happens. Why
nothing happens? Because we have a fixed
width set here. Right? So what I can do?
I can set the width and set it to auto
here. If I do that now this third
element is stretching across the whole
width. Okay. Okay. All right. So I will
just get rid of the width to auto and I
will do the align self to center. Okay.
If I do that so this happens. So this is
the align self CSS property. All right.
Now we will learn about the order CSS
property. Okay. So before doing so what
I'll do? I'll just get rid of the align
self here. And also I will set the flex
direction to row. Okay. All right. So as
you can see here all of the elements are
in order. Right. So let's go to the blog
post here and see what it says. The
order CSS property determines the order
of appearance for the flex items. So
what do I mean by that? As you can see,
we have the example here. Okay. And if
we want to change the order of
appearance of these elements, we can use
the order CSS property. Okay. So the
value you give to this property must be
a number. Okay. A flex item with a lower
number will appear before one with a
higher number. Okay. So if we go to the
MDN order documentation here, the order
CSS property sets the order to lay out
an item in a flex or grid container.
Items in a flex container are sorted by
ascending order value and then by their
source code order. This line is very
very important. Okay. Items not given an
explicit order value are assigned the
default value of zero. So the default
value of order is zero. So let's go to
our browser. For example, once again I
want this third element to be the first
element. So the final layout should be 3
1 2 4. So how I can do that? So what I
can do I can go here for all of the
boxes I can give a order value
to zero and this is the default value.
If I just save now as you can see
nothing happens. Also if I just go to
the code as you can see the order it is
following is the code order because we
have this particular element first that
is why it is the first element and so
on. Right? So what I can do I can go
here
on this particular element with the
class name of three and do order and I
can set the order to one. Hit save and
go to the browser.
So what is happening here is all of the
elements have the order set to zero and
this element has the order set to one.
That is why it is on the right side. But
I want the opposite thing. So what I'll
do I will add here a negative one.
Okay. If I save that, now we have this
element as the first element and all of
the other elements are here and the
order they are following is the order of
the code. Okay. So as you can see this
is the order value. So items in a
container are sorted by ascending order.
Right? So that is why it is happening.
Also what I can do I can change this
order to one. If I just do that then
once again everything is there. But now
what I can do I can set the order value
of zero or I can just omit the order
value at all. So if I do that then this
is what happens. So the third element is
now our first element. Okay. Also what I
can do here I can change the order to
something like two. If I do that so
please remember for all of the boxes it
has the order of one. Okay. And this
particular element has the order of two.
So what will happen? So this particular
element will be the last element.
Okay. So this is what happens. So this
third box is now our last element.
Now the question is why you might want
to change the order? What is the
purpose? For example, what I can do
here? I can just go here. Just get rid
of the order. Get rid of the order.
Right now hit save. Now go here. And to
make this element the third element, the
last element, what I can do? I can just
go to the source code and just cut it
here and paste it down here. If I do
that, then the same thing happens,
right? So, what is the purpose of the
order property? You might be asking. So,
I'll just
revert my changes here. Okay. So, what
exactly is the purpose? And here inside
of the MDN we have a good documentation
or a blog post basically like ordering
the flex items. And if I just go down a
little bit
as you can see for example we might be
building some cards something like this.
Okay. So we have the date we have the
title and we have the description.
Now
to make this particular example happen
what we have to do basically if I just
go here. So we have the card okay and
inside of that first of all we have the
date then we have the title
and then we have the description.
Okay. So you might be thinking like hey
this is not problematic but the problems
appears when some user is using a screen
reader. So when the screen reader will
go through this card it will first tell
the date and then the title and then the
description. And this is not a good
experience. Right? For this particular
card, the main important thing is title
and then description and then the date.
So what we can do by using the order
property, we can change the order inside
of the CSS. Right? So here what we can
do, we can have the title first, then
description and then the date inside of
the HTML. Okay? And then by using the
order property we can change the order
of the date so that the date appears to
be the first element inside of the HTML
page. But in the HTML markup we will
have the title first then description
and then date. So when the screen reader
will go through the card it will first
tell the title then the description and
then the date. So in that way the order
CSS property is quite useful right so
that we can make our HTML page
more accessible right so that is how we
can use the order CSS property okay so
many of the times we cannot change the
HTML markup directly in that case we can
use the order CSS property okay all
right so this is the
order CSS property.
Okay, now we will learn about the flex
grow CSS property. So if we go to the
documentation on MDN, the flex grow CSS
property sets the flex grow factor.
Okay, which specifies how much of the
flex containers positive free space if
any should be assigned to the flex items
main size.
When the flex container's main size is
larger than the combined main sizes of
its flex items, this positive free space
can be distributed among the flex items
with each item's growth being their
growth factor value as proportion of the
sum total of all the flex items grow
factors. Okay. So what do I mean by
that? So if I go here, so as you can see
here, we have some free space on the
left side and we have some free space on
the right side. Okay. So for example, I
want to distribute or I want to add
these free spaces into the first item's
main size. So how I can do that? I can
do that by using the flex grow CSS
property. So flex grow
and set it to one. This flex grow CSS
property expects an unitless number.
Okay. If I do that now what happened is
that all of the free space now added to
the main size of this particular item.
Okay. And also if I just do something
like this. Okay. Now as you can see what
is happening it is not responsive yet
because we have a fixed height and the
width right so what I can do I can set
the width to something like 80%.
here. Okay. If I do that now,
as you can see,
this item is more responsive, right? So,
basically the positive free space is now
decreasing when I am resizing this
browser and that is why the size of this
particular element is decreasing as
well. Okay. So, if I just go here. All
right. So, this is the flex grow. So for
example now I want this particular
element with the class name of two
should grow twice as fast as the first
element. So how I can do that? I can do
that by adding the flex grow factor. So
flex grow
and then I can do two. Okay. So if I do
that then as you can see now this item
has twice as much free space as this
first item. And many of the times there
is a confusion going on like hey the
flex grow determines the size factor or
the proportion of the sizes but no the
flex grow determines the proportion of
the free space distribution. Okay. So
what is happening currently right now?
So because we have set the flex grow to
two. So what is happening? We are adding
up all of the free space, right? And
then we are
dividing the free space into three parts
and then we are distributing the 2/3 of
the free space to this element. and we
are distributing the one/ird of the free
space to this element. Okay, you can
think of like that. Okay, so this is the
flex grow and the flex grow CSS property
determines how much faster the element
should grow. For example, if I just do
flex grow to 10. So this particular
element will grow 10 times faster than
this particular element. Okay. If I just
do that, hit save and now go here. As
you can see, it has a much more free
space assigned to this particular
element. As you can see, this is the
flex grow CSS property which is
responsible for distributing the
available free space to the flex items
main size.
Okay. Now we will learn about the flex
shrink CSS property. So if I go to the
MDN documentation about the flex shrink.
So the flex shrink CSS property sets the
flex shrink factor of a flex item. If
the size of all of the flex items is
larger than the flex container, the flex
items can shrink to fit according to
their flex shrink value. Each flex lines
negative free space is distributed
between the lines flex items that have a
flex shrink value greater than zero.
Okay, by default the flex shrink value
is set to one for every element and also
just like the flex grow this flex shrink
property expects an unitless number.
Okay, so it is the shrink factor for the
flex items. Okay, so to demonstrate that
we will go here and what I'll do I'll
get rid of the flex grow here. I'll get
rid of the flex grow here. And for this
one, we have the width set to 80%. Okay.
So, let's see how that looks. So, this
is how it looks. Okay. Now, for example,
for all of the boxes, I will set the
width to something like 1,000 pixels.
Okay. Hit save.
Now, this happens. So if I just open the
dev tools and see what exactly is the
width. So the width as you can see here.
Okay. So it is 335 pixel. It is not
1,000 pixels. Right? Okay. So what is
happening here? So all of the flex items
is shrinking down so that they can fit
into a single line. Okay. So as you can
see for this element we have 335 pixels
of width. Then for this element 335 this
element also 335 and this element has
also 335 pixels of width. Okay. So if we
want like hey for example this second
element should shrink down twice as fast
as the other elements. So how I can do
that? So for example for each of the
elements we can add a flex shrink
and set it to one. This will do nothing
because it is the default value. But now
for this element what I can do I can do
something like flex shrink and set it to
two. Okay. Hit save. Now as you can see
it is now shrunken down. Okay. So as you
can see what is happening here. We are
saying like hey this second element you
should shrink down twice as fast as the
other elements. Okay. So this thing this
is not a good thing basically because we
have 100 pixels of width. So let's do
something like 500 pixels. And now it is
now shrunken down twice as fast and it
is a little bit bigger than previously.
So what is happening? This particular
element has the 395 pixels of width.
Okay. So width has increased.
So this one also 395. This one also 395.
And this one has 290 pixels of width.
Okay. So as you can see it is now
shrinking down twice as fast. So we can
do something like this. So we can do
something like five. Okay. So what will
happen? this particular element will
shrink down five times as fast as the
other elements right now. Okay. So now
as you can see the width is 434. It is
now increased and for this element it is
172. So now if I shrink down this window
as you can see it is shrinking down five
times fast as the other elements. Okay.
So we can do something like this. So we
can set it to two. Okay. So if I do that
then all of the other elements have the
shrink factor of two but this element
has the shrink factor of five. Okay. So
once again the flex shrink property is
not determining what exactly should be
the proportion of the sizes but it is
determining
how much faster the element should
shrink down. Okay. So what I'll do I'll
just do flex shrink to one. And for this
element I can do flex shrink to two.
Okay. And also we can add as much as
flex shrink values to all of the
elements. Okay. All right. So this is
the flex shrink CSS property. Okay. Now
we will learn about the flex basis CSS
property. Okay. So let's go to the
documentation on MDN. The flex basis CSS
property sets the initial main size of a
flex item. It sets the size of the
content box unless otherwise set with
box sizing. Okay. So what exactly it
means? So for example, what I can do, I
can go here. Mhm. And get rid of that.
And for the width of these boxes, I can
do 200 pixels. Okay. If I do that, then
I can go here. As you can see everything
is 200 pixels of width. But now what I
can do for this first element what I can
do? I can do something like width and I
can set it to 300 pixels.
Okay, hit save. Now the first element
which we have is 300 pixels. Okay, I can
just zoom out a little bit here. All
right, so it is 300 pixels. Okay, that
is good. But now let's see what happens
if I just change the flex direction. So
if I change the flex direction to
column, hit save.
Now this is expected, right? So this one
has the width of 300 pixels and the
other ones have the width of 200 pixels.
But this one has the height of 200
pixels and other ones has the same
height. Okay. So this is good. But let's
change up to row.
Okay. And now what I'll do, I'll just
comment out the width. And here instead
of width, I will do flex basis and set
it to 300 pixels. That's it.
Now, as you can see in the row layout,
what happens is that the width of this
particular element is now 300 pixels.
Okay, that is good.
Now if I change
the flex direction to column and hit
save.
Now as you can see the height of this
particular element is 300 pixels. Okay.
So in that way flex basis is different
from setting up the height or the width.
So flex basis will set up the width when
it is in the row layout and it will set
up the height when we are in the column
layout. Okay. So in that way the flex
basis is different. Now what I'll do
I'll just set up to row. Okay. And now
this has the 300 pixels of width. Now
you might be thinking like hey why we
want to use the flex basis because we
can dynamically change the height or the
width depending on the flex layout right
so that is why we can use the flex basis
and also it is a part of the flex
shorthand property which we will see up
next okay so we are setting the flex
basis to 300 pixels and what we can do
like normally we do something like flex
grow
to one or something like that. So we use
the flex grow, flex shrink and flex
basis together most of the time. So if I
do that then as you can see what happens
is that it started with the 300 pixels
of width and then it accommodates all of
the free available space. Okay. So to
demonstrate that what I'll do, I'll just
go here and just get rid of this
background color. Okay. And also inside
of this particular layout tab and at the
bottom I will turn on the flexbox
overlays. Okay. Now as you can see we
are having this one. Okay. And now if I
just hover over this particular element.
So now as you can see on the left side
we have some dotted section. Right. So
that particular section is the initial
width which we have set with the flex
basis and then on the right side we have
all of the available space which is now
part of the first element because we
have set the flex row to one. Okay. So
if I just do this. Okay. As you can see
now this particular part is the initial
width which we have set by using the
flex basis and this particular part is
now added because we have set the flex
grow to one. Okay, I hope that makes
sense. So we use the flex basis CSS
property so that we can set the initial
width or the height depending on the
flex direction. Okay, to the flex item.
Okay. So we have learned about the flex
grow, flex shrink and flex basis CSS
properties. Now we will learn about the
flex CSS shorthand property. So if we go
to the documentation on MDN. So the flex
CSS shorthand property sets how a flex
item will grow or shrink to fit the
space available in its flex container.
So if we scroll down a little bit, we
have all of these examples. We will get
back to that in a moment. So we have the
constituent properties and as you can
see we have learned about flex grow,
flex shrink and flex basis. Okay, these
three are the constituent properties of
flex. So as you can see the flex CSS
property can take one unitless number
then it can take one unitless number and
it can take one length value then it can
take two unitless numbers and it can
take one length value and we will see
all of these in action. Okay. So here we
have the syntax and here it is described
quite well. So for example for one
unitless number what it says so one
value one unitless number and that will
set the flex grow and the flex basis is
then equal to 0%. What does that mean?
This means the flex basis will not work
and the item will have the height and
the width depending on the height and
the width properties. Okay. So if we
just use only one single number here, so
it will just set the flex crop. So let's
look at that. So what I'll do, I'll just
uncomment this particular background
color. And for the flex spring, I'll
just get rid of that. I'll just get rid
of the flex basis as well and the width
as well. And I'll get rid of that as
well. So if I just save that and go to
the browser now this happens right and
this is expected. Now for this
particular element I can set flex and
set it to one. So what it will do? It
will do flex grow and it will set the
flex grow to one. Okay. Hit save and go
to the browser. As you can see our first
element this element is now growing.
Okay. and it is equal to this one.
Okay, both of them are the same. All
right, so what I'll do, I'll just go
ahead and just delete the flex crow
here. Okay,
then
it can have one value which is the
height and the width. Basically, it can
have one length value. If we set only
one length value then it will set the
flex basis. Okay. So as you can see we
can do something like 10 em or we can do
something like 100 pixel 500 pixel or so
on. So if we set it to that then it will
set the flex basis.
Then we have the two value syntax. So
first value is one unitless number and
the second value is the length value. So
the first value will indicate the flex
grow and the second value will indicate
the flex basis. Okay. So let's see that
in action. So first of all what I can do
I can do flex grow set to one and flex
basis set to something like 300 pixels.
Hit save. Now go to the browser here and
I'll open the dev tools. Mhm.
And if I just hover over that, as you
can see, I'm not sure if that is visible
enough. So what I'll do, I'll just get
rid of the background color for now. So
if I just hover over that, as you can
see, this is the flex basis value, which
is indicated by this area of the dotted
lines. And this is the flex grow value,
which is indicated by this area. Right?
So the flex basis is set to 300 pixels.
and flex grow is set to one. Right?
Okay. So this is equivalent of doing
flex basis of 300
pixels and flex grow of one. Okay,
these are equivalent. All right, then we
can have three different values as well
here as you can see. So the first
unitless value will be for the flex
grow. The second unitless value will be
for the flex shrink and the third length
value will be for the flex basis. And
before moving forward we have to discuss
about this one as well. There are there
is another two value syntax
where the flex will take two different
unitless values. The first value will
indicate the flex grow and the second
value will indicate the flex shrink.
Okay. So we do not use it that much but
we most of the time use this particular
syntax. The three value syntax. The
first value will be for the flex grow.
The second value will be for the flex
shrink and the third value will be for
the flex basis. Okay. So if I just do
something like this. So flex
flex grow set to two and flex shrink set
to two as well. Let's do flex grow set
to one. Okay. Now if I go to the browser
as you can see. Okay. We do not have the
background color. So I'll just add the
background color here. So we have the
background color here right now. So now
as you can see if I just shrink down
this window then our element is
shrinking down twice as fast as the
other elements. Right? So the first
element is shrinking down twice as fast.
Okay? Because the flex shrink is set to
two and then the flex grow is set to
one. That is why it is taking up all of
the free available space. and the flex
basis is set to 300 pixels. Okay, so
this is the three value syntax for the
flex. Now here we have all of the
description of the one value syntax, two
value syntax and three value syntax
which is good. Then if we just go down a
little bit then we have some of the
keywords as well. First of all we have
initial then we have auto and then we
have none. Okay. So let's discuss about
the initial.
So it is basically equivalent of flex 0
1 and auto. So the flex grow will be
zero. Flex shrink will be one and the
flex basis will be auto. So here by
using the initial keyword the flex item
doesn't grow but can shrink. Okay. This
default value expands to this this one
like the flex 01 and auto. The item is
sized according to its width or the
height properties depending on the flex
direction. Okay. If there is negative
available space, then the item will
shrink to its minimum size to fit within
the container but
will not grow to absorb any positive
space available in the flex container.
Okay. So let's see that in action. So
what I'll do I'll just do flex to
initial hit save. So it is equivalent of
flex set to zero one and auto. Okay.
These two lines which I have written are
equivalent.
Okay. All right. If I do that and go
here as you can see I'll just turn off
the one. So as you can see the element
is not growing anymore but it can
shrink. Okay it is shrinking. All right
then we can set the flex to auto. If we
set the flex to auto then the flex item
can grow and shrink. This value expands
to one one auto. Basically flex then
flex grow one flex shrink to one and
flex basis to auto. The item is sized
according to its width or height
properties depending on the flex
direction but grows to absorb available
positive space in the flex container or
shrink down to its minimum size to fit
in the container in case of negative
space. Okay, the flex item is fully
flexible. So what I can do? I can set
this one
to auto.
auto. So this is equivalent of plex one
one and auto. Okay.
So these two lines are equivalent. All
right. If I do that, now our flex item
is growing. Okay. And it will shrink
down as well. So the item is totally
flexible. Okay. Then we can have the
third value which is none. If we set the
flex value to none, the flex item
neither grows nor shrinks. This value
expands to flex 0 0 auto. So flex grow
to zero, flex shrink to zero and the
flex basis to auto. The item is sized
according to its width or height
properties depending on the direction of
the flex container. The flex item is
fully inflexible. Okay. All right. So if
I just do something like
none. So it is equivalent of zero
zero zero and auto. So basically flex
grow to zero flex string to zero and
flex basis to auto. Hit save. Now go to
the browser. And as you can see right
now our element is not shrinking
anymore. Right? The element is not
shrinking. All of the other elements are
shrinking because the flex shrink value
is set to zero. It is not growing as
well because the flex grow value is set
to zero. And also for the flex basis, it
has the auto value set. Right? So it is
not shrinking or growing at all. So this
element is not flexible at all. It is
totally inflexible.
Okay? So by using this value we can make
one flex item inflexible. Okay. So this
is how we are using the flex CSS
shorthand property. So we have a little
bit more of the things as well. As you
can see inside of that we have a bunch
of examples which you can see and so on.
So basically we have covered a lot about
the flexbox right and this is the flex
CSS property.
Okay now we will see how we can add some
gap in between our flex items. So to
demonstrate that what I'll do I'll just
go ahead and remove that. Okay. And then
inside of the flex wrap, I will set the
wrap to wrap. And I will set the height
or the width of all of the boxes to
something like uh 600 pixels. Okay,
something like that. And inside of our
HTML, I will uncomment these two
elements. So if I just do that and go to
our browser, as you can see, we have all
of the elements here. Right? Now what
I'll do, I'll do the align items to
center as well and align content to
center as well. If I do that, then
everything is centered. Okay. So we will
discuss about the gap CSS property here
inside of the flexbox. So the gap CSS
shorthand property sets the gap also
called gutters between the rows and the
columns. Okay, this property applies to
multicolumn flex and grid containers.
All right, so we have two different
constituent properties. We have the
column gap and we have the row gap and
these are almost selfexplanatory, right?
So we have the row gap which sets a gap
between the rows. So the row gap CSS
property sets the size of the gap or the
gutter between an elements rows. Okay.
So here inside of our example we have uh
some rows here. So what I can do I can
go inside of the container here and I
can do something like
row gap
and set it to 10 pixels. Something like
that. If I just do that and hit save.
Now we have some gaps between our rows,
right? So we can do something like 20
pixel as well. So that the gap is a
little bit bigger. Okay. So we have the
gaps between our rows. Now
we have the row gap and then we have the
column gap as well. So the column gap
CSS property sets the size of the gap
basically the gutter between an
element's columns. Okay. So what I can
do here I can go to
this uh code and do column gap
and do something like 20 pixel. Hit
save. Now go to our browser. As you can
see now we have some gap in between our
columns as well. Okay. So what I'll do
I'll just comment out the row gap for
now so it is more distinct. Now we have
two columns and we have the gap of 20
pixel in between our two columns. Okay.
Now
we have the gap CSS shorthand property
as well. As you can see we are setting
the row gap and we are setting the
column gap in this manner. So instead of
doing that we can do something like gap
and do something like 20 pixels. Okay.
And this is basically the same as
setting the row gap and the column gap,
okay, to 20 pixels. So I'll just comment
out that, hit save, and go to the
browser. As you can see, we have 20
pixels of space in between all of our
elements. Basically, all of the rows and
the columns. So we have the gap CSS
property. Okay, so the gap CSS shorthand
property sets the gaps also called
gutters between the rows and the
columns. Okay. So now as you can see we
have some syntax here. So we can add
only one single value which we did. So
it is setting the row and the column
gaps at once. But we have two different
values as well. Okay. So we can do
something like 20 pixel and 10 pixel. So
if I just do that. So we can do 20 pixel
and 10 pixel.
So if I just hover over that then as you
can see what is the syntax. So the first
length value is for the row gap and the
second length value is for the column
gap. Okay. So the gap in between our
rows will be 20 pixel and gap in between
our columns will be 10 pixel. Hit save
and go to our browser here. As you can
see we have 20 pixels of gap in between
our rows and 10 pixel of gap in between
our columns. Okay. So this is how we can
use the gap. Also there are a bunch of
things like we can use ms, we can use
rims and so on. We can use different
units, we can use percentages as well
and so on and so forth. Okay. So we have
all of these values which we can use. So
basically whenever we want to have some
gaps in between our flex items right we
can use the row gap or the column gap or
we can use the gap CSS shorthand
property. All right. So we have learned
a lot about the CSS flexbox. Now we will
take our knowledge and put it into
action. So first of all what we will do
we will learn how to center the element
horizontally and vertically inside of a
flex container. To do so what I'll do
I'll just get rid of all of these code
here inside of the container. Okay. And
we have all of these elements right
inside of our HTML. Okay. So we have
here we have all of the elements. I will
just comment out all of them except for
the first one. Okay, if I just do that,
then we have only this first element.
Okay, and also what I'll do,
I'll just
at the width of 200 pixel. If I do that,
now we have this element. Now what we
want? We want to center this element
horizontally and vertically perfectly
inside of the flex container which we
have inside of the black bordered box.
So how we can do that? So what we have
to do here is we have to go inside of
the container. So what we can do we can
set the display to flex.
Okay.
So if I do that
then nothing happens right. So it is
just a flexbox. Then we have to do
justify content to center and align
items to center. If we do that then as
you can see this element is now centered
okay perfectly inside of the container.
So if I just
do something like this I'll just comment
out the align items right now. So the
justify content is now centering the
element in the main axis. Right. So we
have centered the element inside of the
main axis and the align items is
centering the element in the crossaxis.
Okay. So as you can see this element is
centered perfectly and also it is not
dependent on the height and the width of
the container. It will be centered. So
if I just shrink down the window then as
you can see the width is changing right
but this element is now centered
perfectly no matter what exactly is the
width. And this is true for the height
as well. Okay. If we change the height,
for example, if we change the height
from 1,000 pixels to 2,000 pixels. Okay.
Now, as you can see, our element still
is at the center of our container, which
is the flex container, right? So, in
that way, we can center an element
inside of a container. So, basically
what we have to do, we have to do
display flex so that the container turns
into a flex container. Then we have to
do justify content to center so that it
is centered the element is centered
inside of the container on the main
axis. And then we have to do align items
to center so that the item is centered
along the crossaxis.
Okay. So I'll just do 1,000 pixel. All
right. And as you can see our element
currently is now centered perfectly
horizontally and vertically. So in that
way we can center an element inside of a
container by using the flexbox.
All right. So we have learned quite a
lot about the CSS flexbox. Right. So now
we will put our knowledge into action by
building a simple navigation bar by
using the CSS flexbox. And this is one
of the most common pattern which you
will find to use the CSS flexbox. Okay.
So what I'll do, I'll just go ahead and
get rid of everything basically. Okay.
So I'll just get rid of everything here
except for these styles. These are basic
styles, right? Hit save. And I will go
to inside of my HTML and I'll just get
rid of all of the HTML which I have. So
now I will add a nav tag. Inside of that
I'll add a div. And inside of that I'll
add a h2 and do something like logo or
my logo
or my brand something like that. Okay.
And then what I'll do I'll go ahead and
create an ul element and inside of that
li
and inside of that I'll create the
anchor tag. Okay, this will not go
anywhere right now. So this first
element will be for the home.
Then what I'll do, I'll just copy paste
that a bunch of times. So in VS code
what you can do, you can press shift alt
and down arrow. So 1 2 3 4. Okay. So we
have the home, then we have the about
then we can have the pricing,
then we can have something like
team or something like that and we can
have the contact.
Okay, hit save and go to the browser. As
you can see there is our content. Okay.
And there is nothing basically. So now
what I'll do, I'll just add a class of
navigation
bar. Okay.
Bar. All right. And then I can add a
class of logo here. And inside of that
I will add a class of nav items.
Okay. And each of the alli will have a
class of nav item
singular. Okay. So I'll just copy that.
Paste it down here,
here,
here, and
here. Okay. All right. So nothing will
change. So we will write some CSS to
change up that. First of all, what I'll
do, I'll go here and do the navigation
bar.
Okay. And I will turn this one as a flex
container. So,
display to flex. Okay. If I just do
that, then this will happen, right? So,
our elements are side by side right now.
Okay. And then I can do justify content
of space between not space around space
between and align items to center so
that these elements are centered along
the crossaxis. Okay. So as you can see
this is what happens. Also what I'll do
I'll add a border
border of two pixels solid
and hash ccc.
Okay, this is just for our reference.
This is nothing to do about the flexbox
and anything. And also I'll set a
padding up top and bottom of something
like
two rim and
not two rim, one rim and left and right
of two rim. Okay, if I save that then as
you can see this happens. Also what I'll
do I'll just do a margin
margin of something like
one ring.
Okay, it's so we are having this
navigation bar here. Okay. All right.
And also I'll do a border radius
of something like 6 pixels. Something
like that. Okay. Now these are rounded.
All right. And here what I'll do for the
logo,
I will just decrease the font size. So
font size of 1.2 rem.
Okay, something like that.
So yeah, this is how that looks. So now
we have the ul which have the class of
nav items. So what I'll do, I'll go
here. So I'll do nav items.
And now I will turn this container a
flex container as well. So display to
flex.
And then I will do align items to
center. If I do that then as you can see
these all of these are in one line.
Okay. All right. So all of these are in
one line. But now I want some gaps.
Right. So
I want more specifically I want the
column gap. So column
gap of something like 20 pixel something
like that. If I do that so now all of
the elements are now separated properly.
Okay.
And also what I'll do I'll do something
like for each of the nav item.
Okay. So list style I'll set to none.
Okay. So there is no list style. Okay.
And also for each of the elements for
the list item and for all of the anchor
tags I want no text decoration. So text
declaration to none. Okay. If I do that
then all of the elements are here. Okay.
And as you can see our navigation bar
has taken a quite a good shape. Right.
So in that way we can create a simple
navigation bar by using the CSS flexbox.
So this is how we can do that. And one
thing which you might have noticed is
that we have this one the navigation bar
a flex container and inside of the flex
container we have another flex container
here the nav items right. So we can nest
the flex containers as well. Okay I hope
that was very very helpful. Right. So in
that way we can create a very simple
navigation bar by using the CSS flexbox.
Okay.
All right. So I hope you have enjoyed
this course. If you did, please like,
share, and subscribe to the channel.
Thank you so much for watching and let's
catch up in the next one."

podcast. I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and
founder of freecodeamp.org. Today we're
talking with two university students who
won a recent hackathon with their tool
that helps people who are losing their
vision learn how to read Braille. Very
chill. Before we get to that, I want to
give you some quick community news
updates. Free Coke Camp just published a
discrete mathematics for beginners
course. It'll teach you tons of math
concepts that are key to modern machine
learning. You'll learn some number
theory and common matrix. Then use
Python to explore the pigeon hole
principle, the stars and bars principle,
sterling numbers, the Chinese remainder
theorem, and more. This is a 9hour
course on the free co YouTube.
Completely free, as is everything I'm
going to share during this community
news segment. Everything free camp ever
puts out is free. Check it after you
finish listening to this uh podcast.
Very excited about the interview.
Another awesome course that we published
is a JavaScript course on the
open-source nation agentic workflow
automation tool. That's N8
like N the number eight n I believe it's
pronounced nation. Uh this is very
popular tool and free co instructor
Gavin lawn will teach you core concepts
like working with loops, trigger nodes,
web hooks and more. You can code along
at home and build four real world
projects including a chatbot and an
emergency notification app. That's a
threehour YouTube course. We also
published a Vue.js course so you can
learn the front-end JavaScript
framework. Very popular and it is
designed by Evan Yu whom I've recently
had on the podcast if you want to listen
to me interview like a hardcore open
source developer. This guy has done Vue
and Vit, uh, which is a really cool kind
of boilerplate when you're building your
new JavaScript projects. Uh, but this
course is pretty succinct. It's going to
teach you the very basics, views, core
building blocks like components,
reactivity, template syntax, dynamic
data binding, asset handling, and by the
end of the course, you'll have a simple
Vue app that you can share with your
friends. Check it out. Two-hour course
on the Free Code Camp YouTube channel.
And we also published this tutorial on
the free co publication that will help
you run the open-source LLMs at your
disposal. Not really open source, but
open weight. There is a very pedantic
distinction there. Um, and you can run
them on your own hardware using Olama.
You'll learn how to do this with this
tutorial. This is a great way to unlock
the power of LLMs without the privacy
and security trade-offs of using a big
public LLM website or an API like uh
Google's Gemini or Opening Eyes GPT5.
This free co guide will walk you through
the setup process and give you a feel
for the many many options at your
disposal. And I also strongly recommend
checking out this documentary video
essay about Luigi Kulani and his
biomorphic designs that imitate nature.
There's a picture. If you're watching
the video edition, you can see him in
front of a truck that is extremely
aerodynamic and it's just got lots of
round surfaces. That's kind of a
trademark of his design. If you're
interested in design, this is an
excellent video essay. the German
designers life history and his body of
work. You're going to learn all about
it. Why were his designs so broadly
disliked by the design uh establishment?
They didn't like him. He was banned from
many universities, undergraduate design
programs. You couldn't talk about him or
you get laughed out of the room. In what
ways was he ahead of his time? How did
he influence the development of cameras
or design a gasowered car that got 130
miles to the gallon? Crazy. This was
just a gas-powered car 50 years ago. I
learned a ton from watching this
documentary and I think you will too.
It's about 30 minutes long. Uh link is
in the description. Check it out after
the podcast. Song of the week. Why I
Came to California. This is the classic
1982 Leon Wear song. I love the positive
energy, the brass blast, the duet
vocals. I thought it'd be perfect for
today since I met today's podcast guest
in California when they were visiting
from Canada and I was visiting from
Dallas, Texas. So, check it out. Classic
from 1982.

to today's interview. I'm very excited
to talk about Allison and Cindy whom I
met at GitHub Universe on the shuttle
bus. They recognized me and they had
both used free coke camp extensively to
learn programming and they won the
Northwest Hacks Hackathon and GitHub
invited them to the big San Francisco
conference GitHub universe to present
their project. They got to meet the CEO
of Microsoft Satia Nadella. I got to
meet him too, but they I think they had
a pretty in-depth conversation with him.
It sounds like you'll learn more about
that in the conversation. Allison Co is
a software engineer who's graduating
fall 2026. She's among the prestigious
Major League Hacking top 50 hackers.
It's hard to do this. She's interned at
HubSpot and will soon be interning at
Ripling. Cindy Sway is a software
engineer who's graduating spring 2026.
She's interning as a back-end developer
at Shopify. She also teaches violin and
holds the prestigious level 10 violin
certification from the Royal Conservity
Conservatory of Music. That is a
lifetime commitment to achieve such
status. She's really dedicated to uh
both playing and teaching the violin.
We're going to talk about tips for
securing good internships. They are very
good at doing that. We're going to talk
about how they use AI as university
students and as devs and the limits that
they've discovered and so when to use
it, when not to use it. Like for
example, they completely ripped it out
of their hackathon project and it made
the hackathon project a lot faster. Um,
and how they built their their winning
hackathon project to help people who are
losing their vision learn to read
Braille with whatever vision they have
left, they can learn how to read
Braille. So, they'll be able to continue
to read once they completely lose their
vision. Unfortunately, this happens to a
lot of people. Uh, support for this

Hey Allison, Cindy, how are you all?
>> Good. Excited.
>> Yeah. Welcome to the Free Code Camp
podcast.
>> Thanks so much for so much.
>> Yeah. Well, uh, this is the rare
interview where I interview two people
and I'm hyped to interview you you two
because I met you on the shuttle bus at
GitHub Universe where you were
presenting your hackathon project and I
wanted to hear a little bit more about
how you implemented this and what the
entire experience was like building
this. Uh the project is called
Braillearn and I'm just going to go
ahead and read this blurb from your uh
hackathon project page just to give
people a context into the underlying
problem. Only 10% of blind individuals
in the world can read Braille and only
one in three blindi individuals is
employed. Proficiency in Braille is
crucial for visually impaired children
to help them succeed academically and
help the visually impaired enter the
workforce. There is a high barrier to
entry to be able to learn Braille.
Braille refreshable tablets are not
affordable, often costing $4,000 or
more. And learning Braille often
requires the assistance of a cited
person. So, that's a fundamental
problem. And I want to learn a little
bit more about how you went about
tackling it.
>> Yeah, absolutely. I think there's
there's one more statistic that I'd like
to add. Um, 90% of the employed uh
visually impaired can read Braille. So,
Braille is super essential to entering
the workforce and and finding
employment. Um, but yeah, going back to
how we implemented it. Um, we kind of
started brainstorming I think a week
before the hackathon. Um, and we were
just like, you know, throwing things at
the wall and seeing what would stick.
Um, and yeah, one of us had the idea
like, okay, well, what if we uh did
something with Braille? And a lot of us
had worked with accessibility in the
past. Um, so for example, at my previous
co-op, we did accessibility training um
for web development. And so we learned
about like um all the best practices,
how to make sure a website is
accessible. And I believe Cindy has done
accessibility work as well if you want
to touch on that.
>> Yeah, pretty similar to Allison, but I
was working on a design SDK that had
very strict um accessibility
requirements. So we all had kind of
dabbled in the accessibility land and we
were very fortunate to have a computer
engineer on our team who's not here
unfortunately. Um but he was the
mastermind behind oh what if we like
Arduino whatever something something we
were like sure let's do it like what if
we add um like an educational aspect to
it and have the computer talk to the
user. Um, so that's what we went into
the hackathon with. We same day ordered
a bunch of really crappy um servo motors
and and uh made it work.
>> Yeah. And the prototype which I got to
use. So the project that uh did
extremely well at this hackathon and
ultimately went on to uh be demoed at
GitHub Universe which is a huge honor.
um is essentially like a box that's made
out of like 3D it's like a 3D printed
kind of chassis in which all the servo
motors and and like the the rods that
protrude to represent the braille
characters like the raised if anybody's
not familiar with braille just go to a
public bathroom and there will be some
braille under the men's and women's and
stuff like that right it's just the dots
that blind people rub their uh finger
across uh to be able to uh read and
essentially
you had these servo motors that elevated
and I have a video demo which I'm going
to link to in the description uh of the
pitch that you recorded this like 45
seconds long. Uh we published it on the
free code camp YouTube. So essentially
like there's a hardware component the
actual pins and the motors uh the servos
the Arduino board and then there's the
backend and the front end interface. She
built this nice web interface where I
can go and I can like type words and
it'll like if I type uh in the video
demo we just type Quincy and it went and
it one by one kind of like poked up the
uh the characters in Braille which was
really cool. Um so that's a pretty
sophisticated hackathon project to be
building in such a short period of time.
Can you take us back to the start of the
hackathon and maybe walk us through what
that process was like?
Yeah. So, I think even the day of we
weren't like super sure. Um, you know,
they said that there was going to be
hardware available, but there turned out
to be like three servo motors and I
think like a couple of them were broken.
Um, so which is why we did the same day
delivery. Um, and so I believe it
arrived at like 6:00 p.m. that day and
we started at 12:00 and then the
deadline is is 12 the next day. Um and
so we spent I think the first four or
five hours just working on um like our
front end uh like a pretty basic Node.js
backend server. Um we were sure that we
wanted to implement uh speechto text as
well as text to speech. Um we know that
there are screen readers available but
sometimes those are also uh like they
also have a bit of a learning curve. Um
so we wanted to make sure that it's easy
to get both input and output from um
from our web app. Uh so we spent the
first few hours on the software. Um and
then our servo motors arrived. Um my
uncle who was our uh computer
engineering, he like had the design. Um
and we're like, ""Oh yeah, like this is
going to be easy. Like we're just going
to plug some wires in and like it'll
it'll work."" Um but of course, you know,
that that's not how it happened at all.
>> Nothing is ever simple. Okay. So you you
get the actual hardware in place and
some of these things you're talking
about seem pretty non-trivial uh like
speech to text to speech and then
understanding like screen readers the
devices that visually impaired people
essentially interface with uh that that
that's how they use the browser and
other software on their screen is
essentially they they click around or
they tab around and have stuff read to
them and then they interact through the
keyboard. Um this is non-trivial stuff.
Maybe you can talk about like the
libraries available and like how much of
this you had to code yourself versus
just grabbing some off-the-shelf library
to imple Oh, we got teach uh speech to
text is one API call, you know. Is it
really that simple or how much custom
code did you have to write?
>> You know what it was? It was pretty
simple. It was like literally one API
call. It was we used the web speech API
library. Um and that's I'd say it was
simple to use. Um but the other thing
that we were doing is um in our first
iteration we were only displaying
letters. Um and so our input would be
like the letter C. Um and then of course
that gets interpreted as like the word C
s E E or S E A. And so at that point we
did have um a custom implementation of
interpreting uh specific characters. So
on our first pass, we used cohhere um
which is an LLM and we used that to
process the characters um and we would
say uh Tammy who was our other um
software person on our team, she uh
prompt engineered um where basically
said like return the most likely letter
that's associated with like the word
input. Um, and then we found that that
was too slow
>> because it was doing, you know, LLM
processing.
>> Um, so what we ended up doing was
creating a it's called a custom speech
grammar. Um, where you input uh you kind
of essentially set up the language that
you want the user to be able to speak
in. Um, so we had all the letters set up
in our grammar. Um, and then that had a
higher probability of returning uh
things in that language.
>> Awesome. And was coher like a sponsor at
the event? Because a lot of times at a
hackathon you want to use the different
libraries and developer tools that are
available to you through sponsors and
they'll give out prizes. And I' I've
seen some uh hackathon projects that are
so ambitious is to include like eight or
nine of the different sponsor libraries
and stuff in their ultimate hackathon
project tool. Was that part of your
strategy? Oh, Coher's here. We're going
to use that and and there's somebody
from Coher whom we could talk to to get
guidance if we need it. Uh was that did
that factor into using that?
>> Yeah, I think so. Um they were there and
we're like, okay, like let's let's use
what's available to us. Um and at that
point, a lot of the projects were using
AI and we were kind of like, okay, maybe
we should have some AI in our project.
Um, but it I think for our use case, it
just didn't make sense, which is why we
ultimately got rid of it.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah, that's cool.
>> A better use case for our
um like a better AI use case for us or
probably on be on the learning side, the
education side. We implemented a very
um
hard hardcoded, I guess you could say.
Um
uh what's the word? It's what Ani does
like the like kind of like a space
repetition but a lot worse and like a
lot more
>> like literal and hardcoded. Um but I
think
>> like an LLM driven like space repetition
um uh method where hey if you're
consistently getting the letter L right
every single time we're not going to
show it to you as much. But we kind of
hardcoded that so that could be a good
use case for AI. Um but like Allison
mentioned like the grammar that was
implemented ended up kind of overtaking
the cohhere that we used and it the
cohhere was kind of slowing things down.
So, we kind of just threw it in there
just just to have it. Um, but there were
definitely other use cases that we could
we could look into as well.
>> Yeah, I think ideally we like train our
own model on um interpreting specific
characters, but that's like not
something you have time for in 24 hours.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah. So 24 hours is an extremely short
hackathon. Historically they've been
like 48 hours, sometimes even like 56
hours. Uh because there'll be like the
Friday and then the Saturday and the
Sunday. Um but yeah, I mean that's a lot
of time to go from concept to actual
demo with the hardware component
included. Uh talk about like how much
you slept during that period. What was
your workflow? At what point did you
actually feel like okay we're getting
there? Can you just walk us through like
a rough chronology of the hackathon?
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, um, our, like I said,
our hardware arrived at 6 p.m. Uh, and
that's when we started and we very
quickly realized like, okay, this is not
going to work. Um, we went to the dollar
store. It's probably like 8 or 900 p.m.
Um, like right before they closed and we
bought like it's kind of like a gift
box. Um, which we would put like our
Arduino, our breadboard, and our servo
motors in. Um, and then we also bought
these like they're like sewing pins but
with like a a round end at the end. And
so that would be what we would attach to
the servo motor arm so that when it you
know uh when it moves and rotates up
then the round end would protrude and
then you'd be able to feel the
character. Um, and so we got our
materials and then we we bought like 200
sewing pins because it came in like a
pack. Um, and so uh we had these 200
pins. Um, and our original design was we
just I think like hot glue or duct tape
the pin to the arm. Um, and then if we
rotate it by a super small angle then it
should it shouldn't like angle out too
much. Um but these servo motors are not
the most precise and even right now um
on our like latest prototype all the
angles of the servo motors are like set
to something different uh cuz each one
is like its own calibration. Um yeah and
so
it didn't work and we realized we needed
a free joint and our computer
engineering student he says something
like we needed to convert
rotational energy something linear
motion I don't know unfortunately he's
not here to give a proper explanation.
Um, but yeah, we we figured that out
around maybe 5:00 a.m. Um, so we didn't
sleep and then we were trying to put
things together uh with a lot of duct
tape, a lot of glue, so things were
falling apart even last minute. I think
like
up to 2 or 3 hours before the deadline,
we were still like trying to get things
to work. Um, so it was pretty down to
the wire, I'd say.
>> Wow. So, you literally maggyvered this
together with dollar store
>> just whatever was on hand for your own
site. Wow, that's wild. And uh so, so
5:00 a.m. the sleep depth is starting to
hit probably and you're finally starting
to get can like at what point was there
like, okay, we might actually be able to
finish this project. Was there a moment
where you're like, wow, we we might
actually not have to just sit up there
and give a slide deck, you know, pitch
at the end. We might actually have
something people judges can touch. Yeah,
I'd say like when Yeah. Sorry. You want
to go ahead?
>> No, go for it.
>> Okay. Yeah. Um, it was probably the
moment when we saw like the first pin
like go through and move and it was like
it went in a straight line, you know,
like it it wasn't uh going out at weird
angles. Um,
>> yeah. And the other challenge that we
had was these servo motors are pretty
big and braille characters are super
small. Um, and so I believe uh the
actual spec is like 2.5 millimeters like
in between. So we wanted to get them as
close as possible. In our first
prototype, we we weren't able to do
that. Um, but we we tried to get them as
close as possible. So we had to stagger
the servo motors. So even just like
figuring out like, okay, how do we like
push them together? We had to like
>> join
>> two sewing pins with duct tape to make
it long enough to go through the box.
Um, so yeah, I' I'd say probably the
first moment was like pretty late into
the hackathon.
>> Yeah. Aside from hardware
considerations, like how how tough was
the software development you all were
doing? You mentioned having to kind of
like custom write and like hard code,
which always feels like a dirty hack
hard coding uh logic like that when you
could be using some sophisticated LLM,
but you don't want the latency, right?
Uh, and it sounds like just being quick
and responsive, especially like how long
was the pitching uh that you got? Like
how many minutes did you give? Uh,
>> I think three minutes.
>> Yeah.
>> Like 20 seconds of that or like being an
LLM processing. That's that's a
non-starter, right?
>> Exactly.
>> Exactly. Yeah. Um, and the the speech to
text was also just finicky in general
because if you've ever been in a
hackathon environment, you know how loud
it is. So, we were screaming into the
mic, letter A. Um, but the software side
was honestly
like on the simpler side. Um, like we
did end up like all the software stuff
did end up working pretty well. Um,
there was honestly we had too much
software stuff to be able to show in the
demo. So, we had like some learning
modules and some uh extra quiz
functionality that just didn't make it
into the time constraint. um because you
lose like 30 seconds automatically just
waiting for the speech stuff to process
and if it doesn't go through the first
time then you have to wait again. Um but
overall the software was actually pretty
straightforward in comparison to the
hardware.
>> Yeah. So talk about the uh the actual
demo and the judging and like maybe just
like the last few the last hour or so
>> leading up to submission.
so surreal. Like um
>> it was intense.
>> It was very very intense.
>> Um
>> yeah.
>> Like it was really really cool though
getting to see all the judges like put
their fingers on the actual braille um
and feel the pins coming up and down and
you could see their faces light up. Um
that part was really really cool. Or
when they went to try the software
themselves and like guessed the letter
correct. Maybe we gave them a little
hint like, ""Oh, this is the letter B.""
Um, but then they say the letter B and
then it works. Um, that that moment of,
oh my god,
it actually does what we wanted it to do
was was very gratifying.
>> Yeah. The other thing I learned too is
like you could build the coolest thing,
but if you don't have a good pitch, like
you're not you're not going to win. Um,
and so we were working up until the
deadline. like we were submitting images
um to like our final project submission
like probably 11:59 like a minute before
um and so that was pretty stressful and
I think judging happens like an hour or
two after and so we didn't have that
much time to prepare a pitch because we
were like working so hard um on our
project and so it was it was tough to
like like okay how do we convey the
message of of like why does this problem
exist like why is it so important to
learn Braille. Um, and then yeah, on top
of that, just getting the judges to
like feel the actual Braille and and
have something tangible to to feel and
look at.
>> Yeah. Well, I want to talk a little bit
about what happened after the judging
and everything like what that process
was like because I've participated in a
lot of hackathons. I've actually uh I
won one and I think I came in second at
another one uh which was really surreal
and I've won some vendor specific prizes
as well. Uh but I want to learn more
about what that moment is like for
everybody listening who hasn't
participated in the hackathon yet. Uh
and I'm going to encourage everybody to
do that. Free Coke Camp has a big
documentary coming out about the Cal
Hacks hackathon, the the big Berkeley
hackathon where I went and uh talked to
tons of participants and it was one of
those crazy, you know, overnight
hackathons with it was it was actually
like two days. Some people stayed up for
two consecutive days.
Um so uh but for people who haven't gone
through that process, what was it like
realizing like oh my goodness and then
the you know the award cere like walk us
through the rest of the period and how
you were feeling?
>> I still remember the phone call they we
got
>> when
>> Yeah. It was just can't remember who
they called.
>> Yeah.
>> They called my which is crazy that it
comes via phone call like that. I didn't
think that that would happen and I feel
like if they called me like I don't know
if I would have picked up.
>> Yeah, I never pick up phone calls from
random people. So, it's a good thing I
went to my but they called us and said,
""Hey, you're you're finalist
and we were like are what what do you
what do you mean like can you can you
elaborate?"" Um which was their their way
of saying like we had won there were
five finalists ranked in no particular
order. Um, but I think it was a repeated
it's been a repeated string of like
pinch me moments. Um, like all
throughout even GitHub Universe and like
after that um I keep saying like I kind
of need someone to slap me in the face
and like wake me up, be like, ""Hey, this
is like your real life. Like you're
doing this right now. This is actually
happening."" Um, it's been very surreal
and we're very very grateful to have
gotten the the coverage that that we
have. Um, and to have organizations like
MLH um, and GitHub believe in not just
our project, but also the problem that
we're trying to solve.
>> Yeah. And that was like a first
hackathon win for all of us. Um, and it
was I think my uncle Tammy's last
hackathon. Um, so yeah, it was it was a
big moment for all of us. Awesome.
And so like let's talk about the process
of after the hackathon is over going to
San Francisco to GitHub Universe, one of
the biggest I guess vendor specific tech
conferences in the US. Uh that's focused
on devs. Uh I mean it's essentially like
just two days of crazy networking and
listening to talks and uh hanging out
with people who you maybe you use their
library. maybe the libraries you use use
the library maybe like several layers
downstream but being able to talk to
open source devs being able to talk to
uh I mean I got to meet Satya Nadella
which was pretty cool um just like tons
of different developers around there
maybe you could talk about what that
experience was like because you all
aren't from the Bay Area right uh no
>> you're from Toronto and uh Vancouver
respectively
>> and like what it what that was like
>> yeah um I just want to highlight what it
took before GitHub Universe for us to
get there. Um Allison put in an
incredible amount of work to completely
redo our hardware. Um she completely
learned how to like 3D print. Um and
like redid our whole website and
whatnot. Um using a lot of co-pilot. Um
so there was there was no way we would
have been able to have such a polished
product if if Allison hadn't put in the
work that she did to to get us there.
>> Yeah. Thanks. Appreciate that. Yeah,
like our our box was like in no state to
be on a plane and and travel from
Vancouver to to SF.
>> They asked us if we could ship it to
them beforehand and we said I don't it's
just cardboard.
>> There's no way. I like I I took a look
at that box and pins were falling out
like the duct tape. It was like it was
it was not in a good state. And I think
we also wanted to really get that the
the Braille character spec down. Um and
we managed to do that with our our
latest version. Um so that was really
cool and yeah I after the hackathon um
we did do some work. We we presented
Braillearn at uh Telus. Um and so they
were kind enough to have us talk to
their co-ops, their interns and their
graduate students. Um and so we
presented the problem and and we were
able to talk to uh their accessibility
partner as well. Um and we also
connected with two UBC professors who
specialize in uh Braille education um
and education for the visually impaired.
Um so we were able to get a lot of
context there, a lot of really good
feedback. Um and then we I think
probably six to eight months later like
we got an email from GitHub and was like
urgent action required like do you want
to be a part of universe and of course
like yeah of course like what of course
um it it's like it's such a huge stage
and especially at this point in like our
education in our careers where we're so
like early on I think it's really cool
to be on that kind of platform.
Um yeah, and as for the experience at
Universe,
it was wild. I that was my first tech
conference.
>> Um same here
>> and it was just like like the scale of
everything was crazy. Um we also got the
chance to meet Satia Nadella
>> which is it was really cool. We got to
talk to him about you know AI and and
how it's um affecting us early in our
career. Um just yeah so many cool
opportunities.
>> There was a lot of um like because so
we're from Vancouver um and in
comparison tech scene in Vancouver is
rather small. So for our first
conference to be like such a huge tech
conference specifically all in AI like
my socks were blown off. Like I knew
that it was going to kind of be AI
centered, but I didn't expect
everything to be so AI related and there
for there to be so many new tools that
like I didn't know about. Um so many
companies I hadn't heard of, like so
many solutions um that that were being
put out there. It was
uh
like, how do I say it? We're kind of in
a little like Vancouver tech bubble. And
so yeah, like tech is big in Vancouver.
and you hear about how big it is in
Silicon Valley, but then you go to
Silicon Valley and it's like, oh my god,
it's actually huge. Yeah, that was
definitely a surreal moment as well.
>> Yeah, man. A lot to unpack there. Uh
just a couple quick definitions for
people who are not Canadian. Uh Telus is
like a big telecom company in Canada and
UCB is uh University of British
Columbia. UBC UBC UCB is UC Berkeley.
Uh, so just to clarify, they're they're
talking about the school up north, not
the the one down south, UBC. Okay.
So,
I mean, that sounds like a pretty
surreal experience to be going through
as a student and I want to get deeper
into your backgrounds because
you both are ambitious people. That's
one thing I've taken away from this. Uh
Cindy, you you have achieved like level
10 with the Royal Conservatory of Music.
Probably put in I don't know tens of
thousands of hours playing violin to
achieve that. Do do you have any
estimate? Like you all both have been
working very hard throughout your uh you
know time so far on this planet to get
to where you are today. And I want to
learn more about uh you know that
journey so far. Uh maybe we can start
with you Cindy.
Yeah, I did not know that I wanted to do
computer science until grade 12.
Really the end of grade 11 when I had to
choose my classes for the next summer,
the next year, sorry. And I'd learned
that my favorite STEM teacher um Missak,
shout out to Missiaak. Um she had been
running a computer science co-op program
during high school. So she sets up um
the students with um small contractors
um organizations local to um Suri where
my high school was. Um and I love
Missiaak. So I was like well I know
nothing about computer science I might
as well give it a try. Um at the time I
was like oh my god but if I don't do
computer like if I do computer science
co-op I won't be able to take French 12.
And in hindsight, I'm really glad that
I forewent uh French 12 for computer for
computer science. Um but honestly, I
have like if it were not for Miss Suzak
and that computer science program, I
would have gone down a completely
different path. Um she was the first
person like teacher who had given me the
belief that hey like you can do computer
science as like a woman of color
specifically. Um, and prior to this, I
had also believed that, oh, like I'm not
very good at like math, like physics,
whatever. Can I even make it a computer
science? But she showed me that it's
it's all about your resilience, your
ability to problem solve, um, and your
ability to stick through with a problem
as well. So, I think those are skills
that I picked up from my many, many
hours of of playing violin. Um, I've
been playing probably for the past like
16 years or so and now I I mostly teach.
Um, but I think learning a musical
instrument is like one of the best
things you can do. Um, or and honestly
anything that you pick and you stick
with for a long enough period of time
because it shows your your ability to
stick with something, to ride the ups
and downs, to continue when things get
hard. There were so many moments when I
wanted to quit and I begged my parents
to to quit. Um, but they didn't let me
and I'm glad they didn't because it
taught me the importance of putting in
time and effort into things that that
you're passionate about. Um, and that
ties so well into computer science, into
hackathons, into like getting
internships, um, landing a full-time
job, whatever you have it. So, honestly,
the soft skills that you learn from
music specifically, I'm biased towards.
Um, but honestly, anything that you
stick with is is irreplaceable.
>> Yeah, that's so powerful. Thinking about
all that time that you spent learning
violin and and how it just directly
mapped, I guess, that grit, that
determination, that resilience, as you
said, and and when people are learning
programming, the number one thing I tell
them is it's going to be frustrating.
You're going to have the the error
messages. uh and the failing tests uh
telling you you're wrong, you're wrong,
you're wrong, you're wrong, and you have
to be able to persevere through that. Uh
because if you can't, then you're simply
not going to make any progress and
you're never going to get good at
software development. Uh so it sounds
like
>> it sounds like a lot of that training
that your parents uh kind of subjected
you to maybe against your will at some
time uh was ultimately extremely helpful
in this and it's probably going to be
helpful for any other big audacious task
that you uh endeavor to accomplish in
the future. Very cool.
>> Yes, exactly.
>> Yeah. And Allison, I want to talk a
little bit about you. currently one of
major league hacking, MLH's top 50
hackers. You don't just casually become
one of those is extremely competitive uh
to get into that and I want to hear
about your journey up to that
accomplishing that status.
>> Yeah, sure. So, um yeah, I I did my
first hackathon, I think, in uh second
year of university, which I believe is
sophomore for you guys. Um, and I gosh,
I knew nothing. Um, I had taken like my
intro to to software development course,
uh, which teaches you Java and object
oriented, uh, programming, and, um, we
used I I even forget what it's called,
but we built like a Java guey. Um, and
that course does not prepare you at all
for a hackathon. Hackathons are
completely different. like you need to
be using a tech stack that doesn't
require that much setup, that's easy to
use. Um, and I I really didn't know any
of that. Um, and so that that first
hackathon was definitely tough. Um, but
I, you know, I kept going, I guess. Um,
I attended more hackathons. They are
like really fun. Like they're a really
good experience. You get to meet people.
Um, you get to, you know, try and come
up with ideas and and build something
overnight. Um and yeah I guess after no
even before NW hacks um of this year
which is the one where we built uh
Braillearn um and that was held at uh
UBC University British Columbia um I had
been mentoring hackathons before then as
well um so I was hacking and mentoring
um and then you know coming off this
spray learn win um I I decided to apply
for the MLH top 50 position
Um, and they they really represent all
types of hackers, I think. Um, they have
hackers that have built like really
really cool projects. Um, they have
hackathon organizers, they have
hackathon mentors. Um, and so I guess
that's that's part of the reason why I
was selected is just that I've I've
dabbled in a little bit of both.
>> Yeah.
It sounds like you're not only learning
a lot and doing a lot, but also teaching
a lot. And that's really cool that
you're mentoring. So, how did you two
meet one another?
>> We met in first year. Someone had
created a CS
like incoming 2021 like entering
university in 2021 uh server for girls
in CS and we knew of each other from
there.
>> It was like the nerdiest way to meet
like on Discord like
>> in a computer science server.
um
>> we were taking the same course. Um so we
started working on assignments together.
>> I don't even remember the course, but
we've done since then we've done
hackathons together and lots of other
classes together. Um
it's been such a wild ride. I can't
believe we met on that tiny little
Discord server.
>> Yeah. And both of you are pretty uh
similarly far along. Uh, Cindy, you're
graduating, I believe, in the spring.
And Allison, you're graduating in the
fall of next year, 2026, as of the date
we're recording this, November 19th,
2025. Um, and one of the things that is
striking when I like look at your like
LinkedIn profiles is that you you two
are really really good at the internship
game in terms of just like finding good
internships, successfully applying to
them. Uh, and I'd like to learn a little
bit about your own experience applying
for internships during university and
uh, any tips you would have for people
who are uh, getting ready to go to
college or in college and want to start
uh, the process of applying for
internships.
I think I've been very lucky in my
internship um
application processes and that I've been
fortunate enough to have employers who
really value who you are outside of your
ability to solve leak code problems. So
like my first internship and even my
next couple ones, um the employers are
really looking for what I could offer
outside of my ability to code. So, it
was a lot of like what kind of soft
skills
do you have outside of the workforce?
Like, how do you communicate? How do you
approach problems? How do you work with
a team? Um, I do think of course in
order to even get to the spot where
you're able to answer those soft soft
skill questions, you do need to have the
technical um skills. But if you have
those technical skills nowadays with the
rise of like LLMs and their ability to
solve problems for you,
that's not enough. Like it's not enough
to be able to solve the LEA problems.
You also need to show that you're going
to be a good employee. I think there are
so many different ways that you can show
that. Like getting involved in a bunch
of student clubs, like extracurriculars,
doing projects on the side, of course,
doing hackathons. Obviously,
you need to show them that you're really
committed. not just to Le code style
problems but to the space in general.
>> Yeah, that makes tons of sense. How
about you, Alison?
>> Yeah, I mean there's a lot of different
advice that I could give. I'd say um
like I' I've mentored at quite a few of
like resume reviews or like um I I I
know there's events that like help you
leak code um network. So, those kind of
things, um, I wish I had gone to them
when I was starting out, like for my
first co-op, my second co-op. I wish I'd
gone to those kind of of events, uh,
because they're super helpful and they
have mentors there that are experienced
and can give you um, specific tailored
advice on where you're at in your
career. So, I think it's it's yeah, it
would be really helpful to go to those
events. Um, aside from that, just, you
know, general advice. I think
having a good resume. Um, I've seen tons
of résumés that are like, you know, a
bunch of different formats. And I I
think, you know, figuring out what the
industry standard is. Um, and really
marketing yourself. Um, kind of like
Cindy was saying, like present yourself
as a good employee. Um,
practice leak code. I it still exists
unfortunately um as something that you
have to do in order to get a job. Um and
so brushing up on those technical
skills, having good projects on your
resume. Um, if you're applying for your
first internship, uh, like prove to a
recruiter that you can work in a team,
um, whether that's like through
hackathons or clubs, um, because they
want to see how you've used those skills
on your resume, not just like listing
them out in the skills section, but like
how you've actually used them in your
work and and in your uh, projects.
>> Awesome. So, just to recap, uh, lead
code is not enough.
They want you, recruiters and employers
want you to demonstrate that you can
actually work on a team because I think
so much of university life is solitary
like oh I built this project and turn it
in as homework and there might be some
group work but nothing kind of screams
like I can do group work like winning a
hackathon. Right.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah. So, one of the questions I have is
with these internships, you you all have
gotten to work a little bit in the field
and you've been kind of on a front row
seat for seeing how LLMs and related
tools are potentially changing how work
gets done and you don't have necessarily
the benefit of perspective of having
worked in the field for many, many
years, but you know kind of conceptually
how it was explained to you when you
were applying and probably all the meta
information you've read about working in
tech over the years and now seeing it uh
when you're working at Shopify, when
you're working at some of these other
companies that you all have interned
for, like how are these LLM tools being
used and how powerful are they?
>> Um, so I'm currently at Shopify and I
think Shopify is rather unique in that
they've taken a very public
AI first approach to their development.
So Toby um the CEO he public publicly
released an internal memo about
Shopify's new approach to AI usage and
the TLDDR of that memo is basically that
he wants all Shopify
uh employees to use AI reflexively which
from my understanding means to reach for
AI first. So even before
going to Google something or before
going to Stack Overflow or even before
asking a team member or a mentor about
something,
ask AI. And I think the reason why it's
so stressed is because the best way to
understand the limitations of AI, so in
order to understand what AI can't do,
you have to push it to the limit of what
it can do. So there's all this talk of,
oh, can AI replace like software devs as
jobs? Um, I personally don't think it
can right now at the spot that it is
because I've used AI so much that I've
pushed it to a point where it can't
actually execute what I want it to
execute and I still need to be there to
guide it. So the idea is that the more
you use AI, the more you'll first of all
obviously you'll take get advantage of
its benefits, but also you'll be able to
see what it can't do and where you'll
need to step in. Um because if you don't
have much experience using AI and you
say, ""Hey, do this for me."" And if
you're not properly checking its work
and you don't know its limitations, if
you just check it off and say, ""Hey,
yep, that looks good."" and you ship that
to production and it breaks everything.
Like that's that's not good. So part of
it is that um I think Shopify wants its
employees to
gain the knowledge of how to properly
use AI. And also I think I feel this a
bit more as a student. Um when everyone
else is using AI and you're not, you're
going to fall behind. Like you're not
you're not going to be able to keep up
with all the new technologies. is like
you're not going to be able to keep up
with the velocity um of what's going on.
And so I think some that's something
that students really struggle with
nowadays, myself included. Um I used to
learn new languages like properly um
like sit down, look through
documentation, read good code and now
it's very tempting to just tell AI, hey,
can you write this in like I don't know,
Ruby, whatever. And that takes away your
ability to actually fundamentally learn
things. Um, so that's where it kind of
gets iffy. I don't know, Allison, if you
want to comment more on the student side
of AI.
>> Yeah, absolutely. Go into as much detail
as you can, Alison, about how students
at your school are using LLM tools.
>> Yeah, I think um this semester
particularly, I I don't know about
previous semesters, but I've seen like
there's now like a section in each
syllabus that's like AI usage
guidelines. Um, and I'd say a lot of the
arts courses are like absolutely no
LLMs. Um, but I'd say computer science
courses, they are kind of evolving. Um,
there are now like very specific
limitations on like when and and where
can you use AI. Um, so for example, in
my human computer interaction course,
uh, which is kind of like a UIUX course,
um, they're like, ""Yeah, you can use AI
to, um, like brainstorm. you can uh use
it to do um like market research, things
like that. Um and I'd say they they
still, you know, want you to show your
work, especially on tests, like they
don't want they absolutely don't want
AI. Um and as well in like coding
projects. Um it's kind of like like if
you were doing a math test, they they
wouldn't let you use a calculator, for
example. Um so it's kind of like that.
Um but yeah, I'd say like majority of
students are using AI, especially um in
STEM fields and I think it's it's a
really helpful learning tool. Um, as for
the workforce, I think just in general,
um, you know, we are going in an AI
direction and I think part of the
problem that we're solving is now like
how do we get the benefits from AI as
much as possible? Like how do we improve
our process, our workflow? Um because I
what I've noticed um from using AI tools
at work is that like most of the time or
some of the time it doesn't work like
straight out of the box. You give it a
prompt, it's not going to do the thing.
Um and I think every company is
different. Um you know, every company
has their own coding styles like their
own ways of implementing things. Um so
having like custom cloud documents for
example for cloud code um that's
something that's really important uh you
know using plan mode um breaking down
tasks those are the kinds of things that
software engineers need to be doing now
um in order to get the best results.
>> Okay awesome thanks for sharing those
kind of best practices and what you
think people need to do in order to
actually like really get utility out of
it. And as Cindy mentioned also, there's
the trap of, oh, I can just have the AI
do stuff. It
>> it becomes kind of a mental crutch and
it stifles your own learning because you
don't feel sufficiently incentivized to
get better at things when you got this
magical uh, you know, field. You can
type anything you want and it'll just
give you a big block of code that um,
you can plug in. Right.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah.
>> So, there's there's risk and reward as
we enter this area. And it's exciting to
hear how uh UCB is uh UBC is tackling um
AI usage in class. And uh yeah, it's not
surprising at all to me that uh for
computer science related courses, they
are laying out guidelines. Um and what
you said about taking math tests and not
being able to use a calculator. Well,
the entire point is you understand the
foundational concepts, right? and and
Cindy, you can use LMS to potentially
like help you with like Ruby code and
stuff because you already know how to do
programming in other languages and stuff
like that. And it's just kind of like an
ancillary thing just kind of like uh if
if I already had domain expertise in one
field. Uh I might be able I might feel a
little bit more comfortable just handing
a quick task off to an LM that's related
to that but not exactly something that I
have domain expect.
>> Exactly.
>> So it's kind of like an ancillary
parallel field almost.
If I if I can add one more thing, sorry.
Um, I think
>> as
people like with AI becoming so popular,
the thing that I'm most worried about,
>> even with my own like AI usage, is I'm
afraid that it's going to take my
ability to think critically about
problems and to be resilient when
solving problems because it's so easy
now to say, ""Oh, there's this problem. I
could think about it myself, but I can
also have AI go think about it for me.""
And um if the LLM runs into problems,
it'll just keep trying them itself. Like
I don't have to keep running into the
problems and sit there brainstorming
solutions. Um the analogy I like to use
is like say my parents are really really
good at mental math because when they
were in school they didn't have
calculators and they were told you're
never going to have calculators when
you're out in the workforce so you
better know your mental math well. And
so they know really good mental math.
And so well what happens when me, a
Jenzer, goes to school and there's
calculators everywhere. There's a
calculator in your pocket. Like my
mental math sucks. It's really, really
bad. Um, and I think it's because I was
offloading it onto this tool, the
calculator. So now I think, well, what
what are future generations going to do
when cuz I guess nowadays or maybe a
couple years ago, we'd say, oh, like the
AI can't help you like write this essay.
like you still have to think critically
about the problem, whatever, blah blah
blah. That does that's not true anymore.
Like the AI can totally help you write
the essay and yes, maybe you'll get an A
on it, but are you actually able to
think critically about the problem? Like
it's not the end result is not the
essay. It's what you had to how you had
to move your brain and manipulate your
thoughts
to write the essay to formulate the
thoughts by yourself. That to me is the
scary part is that someday I'm going to
be old and like not be able to think for
myself anymore because AI does
everything for me.
>> Yeah, I think to add like I was just
mentoring at a a beginners only
hackathon last weekend um and that was
24 hours at UBC as well and um these are
people like it's their first hackathons
ever. It's a lot of um first year
students and so um there were a lot of
like completely vibecoded projects and
it's one of the most difficult things to
debug because you're like okay well what
are you trying to do? They're like I
don't know. Um and so it's just where
they essentially just copy pasted
everything that an LLM gives them uh
straight into the code editor. Um, and I
I do think it's still really important
to learn the fundamentals. It's really
important to understand how does an AI
uh how does an API work? How does my
front end talk to my back end? Um, which
is like one of the questions that I get
the most is like, okay, how do I how do
I get it to return data? How do I call
this API? Um, so those are things that
is still really important to learn. Um,
and of course you could ask an LLM those
questions, but it's really difficult to
know what questions to ask.
>> Yeah, absolutely.
>> Exactly.
>> Yeah.
>> I think a lot of the problem is that AI
is ramping things up in terms of speed.
So if you're a new user, if you're a new
like new to the computer science field,
you enter and you're like, ""Oh my god,
everyone's already so far ahead of me. I
don't have time to sit down and learn
the fund fundamentals."" And that's when
things like free cook camp are really
really useful because they actually take
the time. Like yes, they're so much
longer, but the benefits so outweigh the
amount of time that you spend on it. Um
because the alternative is
to have AI do everything and not
understand what it's what it's giving
you.
>> Yeah, I started with precode camp if uh
that's any indicator.
>> That's awesome. Yeah. Well, I'm I'm
really excited to learn more about like
like and watch as you all progress with
your careers. Um it's exciting, of
course, to see Freo camp alumna going
forward and just accomplishing great
things like you all have been doing. And
one of the questions that I have is just
where with the grand scheme of things,
you all are doing internships, you're
going to go apply for jobs and things
like that. And you've built this amazing
prototype of this tool that potentially
has a huge addressable market and has a
really powerful value proposition for a
huge number of people uh that need to
learn Braille. This could be people that
are just losing their sight in their old
age and the doctor saying like you've
got maybe like three or four years left
before you're completely legally blind
and you'll be dependent on, you know,
braille for being able to read and
things like that. Like like this this
tool is something that can help these
people. Uh
>> how do you all have plans for continuing
to maintain or expand this or productize
this? Like where does this fit in the
grand scheme of things over the next
five year map that you all have laid out
for your lives?
Yeah, I think
>> Sorry, go ahead.
>> Okay, I will. Um, yeah, I think the
hardware it it's something that's really
difficult um to, you know, be able to
get it out there um mass produce and
right now we're only at one character.
Uh, so we would need to be able to, you
know, completely redesign how we
actually fit several characters um on a
piece of hardware. Um, and I think we as
a team need to do um, you know, probably
a lot more research. Uh, talk to
organizations, talk to people in, uh,
the visually impaired community, figure
out like what problems specifically need
to be solved. Um, even just aside from
uh, refreshable braille displays, um,
and figure out how to make, you know, a
solution accessible to everyone.
Yeah, we fully recognize that we have
made a product for blind people or the
visually impaired and none of us on the
team are visually impaired. So, there's
a big gap between,
hey, here's what a bunch of visually
impaire like non-visually impaired
people think the visually impaired
community would want, but is it actually
what they need? Does it actually
fit a proper niche that actually needs
to be solved? There's a lot of like
Alison was saying a lot of market
research that we need to do um and
exploring different avenues like like
maybe nonprofit or open source.
The world is our oyster.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. We also we talked to the head of
accessibility at GitHub um when we were
at Universe and um he gave us a lot of
good feedback and he's uh blind himself
um so he got to test out um our product
and he yeah he he even suggested like
you know we could go a software only
route um where it's compatible with uh
existing braille displays um and he was
saying like yeah hardware is a hard
thing to do um so lots of things to
explore for us Yeah, that's awesome. You
could just do a stage development where
you start with a software product and
then eventually offer a hardware
product. That's a lot like something a
lot of companies have done over time.
Like you look at like Snap and they were
purely software Snapchat uh software
tool and then they eventually introduced
like the the specs the tech camera and
that was their hardware entree and
that's hard. Hardware is hard and it's
also very expensive. you screw something
up and then you have to deal with the
logistics, shipping, tax, like all these
crazy additional layers of complexity,
but software is just everywhere. So
yeah, maybe that's like a great kind of
like goal for the meantime is just
continue to improve the quality of the
software and maybe make a library that's
that compatible with like the uh Braille
tablets that you all mentioned that are
like 4,000 bucks. That's a lot of money,
but I guess if you're using it all the
all the time. Uh yeah, and and some of
that may be subsidized by governments uh
through like disability assistance and
things like that. So, um yeah, this is
really exciting. One question I have for
each of you in closing, you have
accomplished so much during your three
and a halfish years at university. Uh,
if you could send something back to
yourself, just like a short tip or
message that you could send back to
yourself when you were just arriving as
a freshman, what would you send back to
yourself that might make your life a
little bit easier?
>> Great question.
>> I um want to say this with caution and I
hope none of my past professors are
watching this, but
care less about school. Um, if I can say
that I it took me a long time to realize
that the grades that I was like the good
grades that I was getting in class were
not
going to be reflective of what the job
market was like and what the workplace
would be like. You can learn all the
theory that you want, but until you sit
down and go to a hackathon or hash out
some some project on your own, actually
get your hands dirty and literally code
instead of learning about code and
learning about like theory. Um, you're
not going to get terribly far unless you
want to like pursue research of course,
but
it was too late until Sorry, my Siri
activated. Um, it took me too long to
realize that I should be doing more
projects hands um hands-on instead of
worrying about trying to get like a 95
on a quiz that was worth 10% of my
grade.
>> Right on. And Alison,
>> yeah, I was kind of the same. I I I
think even up until like a couple
semesters ago, I was like, you know, and
I just started to think like why why am
I why am I trying so hard to get this
good grade? like what's it what's it
going to do for me? Um so yeah kind of
the same as Cindy and I think separate
from that just you know keep exploring
what's out there. I think it's really
important to stay up to date, stay up to
date. Um, you know, keep learning new
technologies, use whatever tools are out
there and um, yeah,
>> fantastic. Well, it's been an absolute
pleasure talking with both of you. Uh, I
am super proud of everything that you
all are accomplishing and I'm thrilled
that Freo camp has been a helpful
learning resource. uh and hopefully will
continue to be a helpful learning
resource as you all continue your
educations even once you're working as a
software engineer in the field. Um and I
really appreciate you making time out of
your busy uh Wednesday morning to join
and have this conversation and I think
it's going to inspire a lot of folks.
>> Thank you so much for having us. Much
appreciated.
>> Thanks so much.
>> Yeah. Well everybody until next week.
Happy coding."

*IMPORTANT*
Make sure to go into 1) edit in the upper left corner 2) preferences 3) system
4) and switch to ""CUDA"" OR ""Optix"" and enable your GPU if you've got one! If you're on Mac
your settings will probably be different: Select ""Metal"" instead of ""CUDA"" if you've got
something like an M1 chip. For either device switch to GPU compute as it'll be faster, unless
somehow you have a device where your CPU is better.

*IMPORTANT*
When baking you typically want to go for .01, I think I did .003 which is a bit
too small. If you have UVPackmaster3 you can set a pixel margin, if you're at 4k it should be
32px, at 2k it should be 16px, 1k at 8px etc. Obviously it depends on your use case, but
those are recommended ranges!!

developed this course. Hey everyone,
welcome back to another video. Thanks so
much for stopping by. So, without
further ado, let me just refresh the
page and show you what we'll be creating
today. So, small loading screen. Hover
enter, hit enter. That just says hello.
Changes a little bit. Small little
animation there. And then we have these
objects animating in to catch the user
intention. Sorry, let me just move this
for a second to catch the user's
attention to so they know where to
click. So that's why I animated these
and these and these as well. And then
when you click on one of these, it pops
up a simple model like so. And you can
style it however you want, like so, you
know, very, very simple. And then you
can also click outside of the thing as
well. So, if you're familiar with 3JS, I
just used orbit controls for navigation,
except I limited the pan and the
rotation so we don't see the back of it
because I deleted a bunch of faces back
there. If you don't know what I'm
talking about, that's totally okay. So,
now I just want to talk about the
specifics of what you'll learn in this
video cuz there's a few things that
you're seeing that I won't explicitly
teach. So, one of them is the light to
dark mode toggle here where I switch
from light theme to dark theme. This
requires a shader, which I was planning
to cover in this course, but I felt like
it was getting a little too dense and a
little too long, so I did not include
that. Don't worry, my next video will,
but the code is there if you want to
take a look at it and take a stab at
yourself. But mostly everything like
this hover effect, you'll learn about
it. You'll learn how to create your own
materials in Blender. You'll learn how
to model everything, unwrap things. You
can take a look at the video chapter
stamps. So, primarily the only two
things that I'm not teaching is this
coffee steam here and the light theme
and dark theme toggle. But everything
else you'll be able to know how to
create by the end of this video. So,
some segments are very very slow and
step by step and then others are more
just speed up walking through you code
where I just have the code there and
then I just talk about it through there
and then everything in between, you
know, half of writing code and talking
and then also half step by step and
drawing out explanations. So, I kind of
just adapt it based on what I think that
specific section needs. But by the end
of this video, hopefully you can create
some really awesome stuff. So, when it
comes to prerequisites, you just need to
know the basics of Blender and the
basics of 3GS. I do have an intro to
creative web development course where I
cover a lot of concepts much slower than
I do in this video. I kind of just
assume like you already know how to set
up a basic scene. You know how to do
some basic models in 3GS. In this video,
I assume you don't have any knowledge of
3JS and have no knowledge of Blender.
So, if you want, you can skim through
getting started with 3GS. And if you
understand everything there, then you
should be more than good enough to go.
Same with Blender. If you can make like
this tree and like this background here
without any help, you know, you're
definitely well prepared for what we're
going to be doing. Yeah. So, definitely
reach out if you have any questions.
Feel free to reach me out on Discord.
I'm most active there. You can find it
probably in my YouTube description
somewhere, but email is totally fine as
well. Also, if you'd like to support me,
you know, definitely consider checking
me out on patreon.com. I would really
appreciate it. Uh, you know, anything
means a lot. Or alternatively, if you
want to buy me a coffee, that's really
awesome as well. And if you do ever, you
know, financially support me in some
way, you know, definitely reach out for
a chat and a call and we can just set
something up for sure. I would
definitely love to chat with you. So
without further ado, let's get straight
into the video. Hope to see you on the
other side and definitely share what you
create. Okay, before we start modeling,
I just want to talk about some terms
that you'll hear me say a lot and I kind
of want to explain them. So when I say a
try, uh what I mean is a face with three
vertices. 1 2 3. And if I say a quad,
that's one with four vertices. And then
you'll hear me say engon, which which
you've probably heard of things before
like pentagon, octagon, so on so forth.
Those prefixes actually resemble
numbers. So we just represent it with n,
right? Some number of vertices gone or
whatever. Um, so like let's say we have
a pentagon, right? This has five
vertices like so. So instead of calling
a pentagon, I'll just call it an engon.
And any face with you know more than
four is going to be called an engon in
my book. And obviously if you have just
two vertices, this is like a line or
something, right? So, it's generally
best practice to try and make your
model, your objects consist of quad
faces and quad topology. And the reason
for that is because 3D software handles
the calculations that it does behind the
scenes a lot better with these quad sort
of faces rather than some of these other
ones like engones and tries. It doesn't
mean you always have to go for quads.
It's just general best practice. Also,
when you have quad topology, you kind of
want them to be equal in size across
your model, other than obviously areas
that need more detail. Um, but for the
most part, places with the same level of
detail should have relatively similar
quad sizes.
Yeah. So, as I work through the
tutorial, I'm going to be going into
more detail and showing more examples so
you know what I'm talking about, uh, and
can visualize it a little bit better
than what I'm doing here. All right. So,
I'm in a new general Blender file here.
Now, I'm going to say all the hot keys I
use out loud, but in case I forget
something, try and look down here to see
if you can see it over here. Not
everything will show up here. So, in the
case that I don't mention anything and
it doesn't show up here, you know, just
post a timestamp below and I'll get back
to you as soon as I can. So, the first
thing I'm going to do is probably delete
this point late. And then I'm going to
hit M and move this into a new
collection called lights, camera,
action, and just disable it so we don't
see it in the meantime. Now, to start
and create a room, you can totally start
with the default cube. So, let's just do
that. So, I'm going to hit S to scale it
up. Then, I'm going to go into edit
mode. And if you want this pi menu thing
here, you can go into edit preferences,
go into keymap, and do tab for pi menu.
That way, you can easily go between all
different kinds of modes. By default, if
you hit tab, you'll just go into between
object and edit mode, but I like doing
this because I use these other modes,
too. not for this video, but you'll get
used to it and it'll be just as fast as
hitting tab eventually. Anyway, what I'm
going to do is hit three to go into face
select, which is right up here. I'm
going to select these three, and I'm
just going to hit X and delete the faces
there. Now, instead of selecting these
faces, well, I guess every single face,
so you could just hit A to select
everything and doing Alt E extrude along
normals and then hitting S to scale
evenly. Instead of doing that, I'm going
to add a solidify modifier. This way we
can just easily adjust it later if we
want to. So now if I increase my
thickness, you can see maybe I want to
go that way instead. It's going to do
the same thing. And we can just check
even thickness here. Now generally
before you apply a modifier, you should
apply your scale. So I'm going to hit
apply my scale. And you can see that's
going to affect my solidify modifier,
which is totally okay. For us, solidify
modifier is not really a big issue
whether you apply your scale or not. But
for other modifiers, it will be. Anyway,
we can always change it later. So,
that's pretty good. And now I just want
to move my cube up to above the grid
just because the grid is a little bit
distracting. You can hide the grid if
you want, but I'm just going to move it
above the grid. So, I'm going to go here
into orthographic view and just bring it
up just sitting right there. Cool. So,
now we have a room that we can play
with. And of course, if you want to
adjust it, you can totally do that as
well. I might be making slight scaling
adjustments later
and off camera, but I'll just show you
now that I would go into wireframe view
and probably just do something like
this. Uh, GUI, select the vertices and
things like that. Um, and and scaling
and and so on so forth. So, just in case
you see some slight changes, that's what
I'll be doing. Now, I don't like how
sharp these areas are. So, what I'm
actually going to do is add a bevel
modifier. And that'll just give it a
more sty. And that'll just give it make
it a little bit more stylistic and cute.
So, we can increase the amount of
segments to maybe like four. And you can
see now it looks really really smooth.
And then you can adjust how much you
want to bevel. So, if you want it like
more plumpy, you can totally increase
the amount just like that. And then
right now, what it's doing is flat
shading the geometry that's being added.
So, what you can do is right click and
do shade smooth instead. Now, there's
this other option called shade auto
smooth, and it'll only take faces that
are at certain angles and smooth those
instead. So, you can see if I do shade
auto smooth, we kind of get the same
result. Um, this is not really a good
model to show what that does. But, um,
you can see we get the same result. So,
we'll just leave that there for now. Now
again, if you're a beginner to Blender,
uh you'll know that bevel and solidify
modifiers, these are operations you can
actually do with Blender yourself. So
again, if I just add a cube, just to
show you, go into edit mode, select
these faces, A to select everything, alt
E, extrude along normals, S to scale,
then I go into edit mode, hit A to
select everything, then I apply my
scale, go into edit mode, hit A to
select everything, then do Ctrl +B,
move my middle mouse button up to
increase the amount of bevels. I have
four cuts on my bevel modifier, and then
I'm just going to left click and drag
there. And then I'm going to rightclick
and do shade auto smooth. And you can
see we get the same thing here except
one of them we did with modifiers.
Whereas the other ones we use the actual
operations. So you can see if we do uh
shade flat you can see we're going to
see all those phases. But if we do shade
smooth we're going to get rid of all
those. Super super cool. Okay. So, the
next thing when it comes to creating a
model and things like that, other than
getting references, is to block out your
scene and try and get a feel of what you
want in your room, your composition, and
things like that. You won't always do
it. And for this tutorial, I don't think
I'm going to be doing it, but I do want
to touch on it because it's a ve very,
very common practice when you starting a
3D art project. It's the same way how
artists might have like guiding lines or
sketches that start out before they
start coloring and and things like that.
So blocking out is kind of the same
idea. So let's say you add like a plane
here. And you're like, ""Okay, I want my
bed to maybe kind of look like this.
Maybe about this shape. Go into edit
mode. Hit A to select everything. E to
extrude everything."" And you're like,
""Okay, my bed's going to be here."" And
then maybe you come over here, go to
this add cube tool, and you're like,
""Okay, I'm going to like put a desk over
here. So maybe I want a desk over here.""
And then, okay, maybe I want some
shelves over here. Like so forth. And
then maybe you go into the annotate tool
and you're like, ""Okay, maybe I want
like a clock over here."" Uh, and then
maybe like a lamp over here. Sorry,
that's not a lamp. Um, that's a lamp.
No, that's not a lamp either. And then
you kind of just like, you know, get the
get the general vibe of of what you
want. So, that's totally an approach
that you could go for if you want to.
And it's a very very common practice,
but for this video, I'm just going to be
showing you how to model things rather
than blocking out and and doing
composition and all that kind of stuff.
Okay, so I'm just going to select these
and I'll just delete them. So, one thing
I definitely want is a desk. So, I'm
just going to shift right click
somewhere to spawn a cube. So, shift A
and just add a cube. Bring it up to any
height. It doesn't really matter. You
can always change it later. And kind of
just like get it to a scale that you
like. Doesn't really matter. And uh I'm
just going to try and get a eye for the
desk. It doesn't have to be
proportional. Again, we're going for a
more stylistic rather than realistic
scene. So, if it's not proportional,
that's totally okay. And of course, you
can always change it later. Uh, and then
I'm going to go for a standing desk. So,
this is going to be a little bit
non-traditional compared to regular
desks. And I don't like seeing this
here. So, what I can do is either go
into local view with my numpad slash or
come over to view local view and do
toggle local view like so. Um, or you
can just hit this and hit the eyeball
here or hit H or Alt H to unhide. So, H
or Alt H. So, I'm just going to go into
local view here. And what I'm going to
do is probably shift right click
somewhere over here. And uh just add a
plane. And I'm just going to scale that
down like here or something like so,
which will be the desk leg. And go into
edit mode and just hit E and extrude it
downwards. Then since this face is still
selected, I'm actually going to hit P
and separate by selection. So what that
does is my selected thing now just
became its own object. Now it still
takes the origin point of the original
thing that I separated it from. However,
we can fix that if we do rightclick set
origin origin to geometry. And now the
origin's geometry is over here. And the
scale and every operation will be around
this origin point. Now, since the leg is
going to be the same on the right and
left, what I'm going to do is go into
edit mode, add a loop cut to this plane
right here. Right click to cancel the
movement. And I'm just going to delete
those vertices by selecting them. And
I'm going to come over here and add a
mirror modifier just like this. And now,
if you're working in a different axis,
you might have to change this, but I'm
on the X. Then, I'm going to turn on
clipping. This way, if I go into edit
mode, you can see that they're not going
to go through each other. If I turn it
off, you can see they're going to go
through each other and things like that.
Now I can just select these, go into
wireframe view, and just do GX,
and then go into side view, and then
just extrude it at like a small angle,
kind of like this. And then I'm just
going to hit E to extrude the the
vertices again, and lock it on the
X-axis. And probably go around here. And
then I'll just hit E and just extrude
again. Probably around here, just like
this. And then I'll do E and lock it on
the X-axis. But this time I want to turn
on snapping. I'll turn on snapping here.
go to vertex snapping. And now when I do
G to move it, lock it on the X-axis and
hover over this vertex here, you can see
it's going to perfectly align just like
that. And now if I go back into object
view, I can turn off snapping here and
go into solid view. You can see we kind
of have a table like like this. And then
we want to fill in these faces. So I'm
going to select these two edges. Go into
hit F to fill. Select these two, fill
those as well. Select these two, hit
fill. Select these two, and hit F to
fill. Just like that. So now we kind of
have like a table leg there. And then
let's just scale it up just a little bit
because I want it to be blocky and
stylized. And then I might increase this
just a little bit. Okay. When it comes
to standing desks, uh usually there's
like some sort of inset, right? And then
the other there's like another overload
thing that actually moves up and down
the bar. What I'm probably going to do,
well, first this is a little bit too
thick. So I'm going to scale it first on
the S and Y and then probably on the S
and Z just like this. I'm going to apply
my scale and then go into edit mode and
whoops, I accidentally removed this
face. But what we can do is just hold
alt to select that entire edge loop
there. Rather than clicking on all four
of them, we can just hit alt and go near
the edge. Hit fill just to fill that up.
And then what we can do is hit I just to
insert it a little bit like so. And then
now we can just do E and extrude
downwards. And since we have vertex
snapping on, we can just snap it to a
vertex like this. So, if you hold
control, it'll turn it on automatically,
even if it doesn't show it's on. You can
also just come up here and click it, and
you can see it'll snap there. Again,
make sure you lock it on the axis, and
you can snap it. Since these are all at
the same level, it doesn't really matter
which one you choose. Uh, so I'll just
use this one here, but typically I
usually just use control rather than
come up here to toggle it on and off.
You can also hover over it. And you can
see shift tab is also another way to
toggle it on and off, but usually I just
use control, which is the hotkey for it.
Okay, so now we kind of have our
standing desk functionality. If you
want, you can go into wireframe. Again,
just select all these and kind of just
adjust it here. And if you wanted
multiple layers, you could just insert
again and so on so forth. Okay, let's go
out of local view. Um, and let's go back
into solid view. That looks like a
pretty cool desk. Obviously, it's not
inside a room, which is fine. We can
just adjust that very, very nicely. Just
like that. Now, what we can do is use
mirror modifiers for these. So, I'm
going to come over here and add a mirror
modifier. And then I'm just going to
select this object to mirror over. And
since I'm it's in the Y direction, we
can switch this to Y. And now you can
see it's over there. And get rid of the
X value. Then same thing with here, but
instead of adding the mirror and doing
all that again, what we can do is select
this, shift select, and select this one
as well. Make it the active object. Come
over here and do copy to selected. And
that's a really easy way to copy a
modifier from your selected object or
your active object to your other
selected objects. And you can see it's
added right here. This is going to be
the same thing we do with the bevel
modifier. So our room right here, it has
a bevel modifier, right? And we want to
copy this to all of these as well. So
what I'm going to do is select all
these, hold shift, and make this the
active object highlighted by orange.
Then I'm just going to come over to the
bevel modifier and do copy to selected.
And now you can see the bevel modifier
is also applied to our table stuff. And
make sure to apply your scale so it
works properly. And I'm going to
rightclick and do shade smooth again.
And you can see, okay, cool. We kind of
have something more stylistic. And if
the bevel is too much, you can come over
here and with all three of them
selected, you can see they all have
0.168 amount, right? With all of them
selected, if you hold down Alt on your
keyboard, you're going to you can adjust
the bevel for all of them all at the
same time. Just like that. So 0.78 looks
good. And of course, if you want to
adjust one of them's bevels and not the
other, you can totally just do it
individually as well. But if you want to
group bevel, that's totally how you do
it. And I feel like these are a little
bit too uh far. So what I'm going to do
is just do GX and kind of move it a
little bit. S Y SX. And then maybe
select this and kind of just scale that
in a little bit. So there we kind of
have like our cute little standing desk
there. All right, let's create a
tabletop thing. So I'm just going to go
shift right click on top of my table. Um
and probably add a plane. Then just
scale it down. S Y probably scale it
down a little bit. Uh S Y just like
this. Go into edit mode. E to extrude
that up a little bit. Go back into edit
mode. Add a loop cut here. And then just
give it an arbitrary size. and uh
probably just E and extrude this out.
And what I'm going to do is add a mirror
modifier so I don't have to do it on the
other side. So I'm just going to do
that. Let's go into Y here. And since
it's mirroring across this origin point,
it's going to look like this. So what
we're going to do is select everything
in edit mode. Gy, and just pull
everything over here. And then let's
turn on clipping. And then let's just
bring it back inside just like so until
it snaps. Then let's go into edit mode
still. Well, I was still in there.
Select this face. Make sure that's
selected and just delete that because
we'll never see it. And uh cool. We kind
of have a stand like this. And I just
want to give it some style. So I'm going
to select this E to extrude this out a
little bit. Select this one and kind of
just bring it in a little bit. Just like
that. All right. And now let's apply our
scale. And with this one as the active
object, let's just come over here and do
copy to selected. So now this has a
bevel modifier. And I'll just do shade
auto smooth here. Now, you will notice
that there are some slight shading
issues here. That's due to the way that
we modeled the thing. Um the Hey, I'm
Andrew from the future. I just want to
talk about a quick fix to fix this
corner here. Um, I did say it was a
little bit too advanced because the
professional way to fix it up is is a
little bit too advanced for this course,
but there's a really really quick way to
fix it, at least visually good enough
for us, and I show it later in the
video, but I'm just going to do it now.
So, in your bevel modifier, what you can
do is come over to miter outer and
change that to arc. And you can see that
kind of already fixed some things. And
then if you still have pinching here,
you can try changing the amount of
segments. And you can see going down to
three actually made that a little bit
better. And of course, you can also try
and adjust the mount here as well. And
then you also have this profile thing
here in shape that can also adjust, you
know, what kind of bevel you have. So I
guess right now it's not a great example
for using shape here, but when you use
bevel in the future, you can play around
with the shape to kind of help it out a
little bit. Additionally, you'll see me
add weighted normal modifiers to fix the
shading of beveled things, which is
totally fine. But you can also just come
into the shading tab and click on harden
normals here. I just by habit add
weighted normal modifiers. So, just to
show you the difference in geometry when
I do arc versus sharp. I'll make this
one sharp. I will apply both of the
modifiers right like so. And you can see
that this one is using sharp. This one
is using arc. Typically, we go for quad
geometries, which is what arc gives us.
So, it's got a better edge flow here.
Now, there's still an end gone here. So,
there's still issues with the topology,
but again, you know, that's like an
advanced concept. So, this will be good
enough. This will be better than uh what
we see here. Yeah, I just wanted to
point that out. And honestly, even if
you leave it like this, it's really not
a big deal either. Um, you know, just
focus on having fun and and don't really
worry about anything like that, right?
So we can do the computer now. Let's
just shift right click somewhere. Shift
A. Add a plane. Just scale it down. Go
into edit mode and just E extrude that
up. Let's go out. Apply our scale. Go
into edit mode again. Select this face.
I to insert like so. Creates a face
within the face. G. Shift Z and just
move it. Uh, well, actually, let's just
do GX and move it backward like here.
And then just E extrude that up. Then we
can go into face select and just hold
alt to select the entire loop. Alt s to
scale along normals and just make it a
little bit thinner. Just like that. Then
we can add like a loop cut. Um and uh
kind of just extrude it inwards a little
bit. Super super cool. Uh then we can do
shift duplicate right click cancel p
separate by selection. So this will
become our computer. Right click set
origin origin to geometry. And we can
just scale that up a little bit. And
then we can do a little bit sy like
this. Uh then we can go into edit mode.
Hit A to select everything. E extrude
outward. Let's apply scale on this.
Let's go back into edit mode. Hit I to
insert a little bit. And then E to
extrude it inwards. And there we kind of
have a computer with a stand like so.
And I think I just want to move this up
uh just a little bit so we can see a
little bit of the stand there. Um I feel
like the stand is a little bit too big.
So, I'm just going to select all those
and do website proportional editing on
uh we'll talk about that in a little
bit. Um I must have hit a hotkey or
something, but I'm just going to hit alt
s and scale this along the normals just
like that. Um this is also a little bit
too thick. So, I'm just going to hold
shift and alt to select both of those
loops and just do sy and kind of scale
it down a little bit like so. Um then we
can just select these again. Uh, with
this one selected, I guess we can just
do copy to selected, just like so. And
of course, make sure to apply our scale.
Uh, one thing I'll say about this
computer now is that it looks too thin
compared to the rest of our scene. Uh,
we want to go for more bulky and like
full sort of vibe. So, what we're going
to do is and go into edit mode and
select the screen itself. Actually, we
can turn this off temporarily so you can
see what I'm doing.
Um, and we're going to hit controll
numpad plus to increase our selection.
You can see it expanded our selection.
So, we don't have to do that. Or you can
just select this face, hold shift, alt,
and try and get the loop, which also
works as well. Or if you want the more
hotkey, you can select a face, do select
more or less, and you can see the hotkey
is control numpad plus. You can just do
more and it'll select everything. And
then I'll do S, and then I'll scale it
down. And then I don't want to do it on
the X-axis. I don't think it is, but I'm
just going to do S and then shift X and
then just scale it a little bit here.
And then I'm going to reactivate my
bevel modifier so I can just kind of see
how
uh how thick it would be. Cool. And the
computer itself is too thin. I like the
frame. So, what I'm going to do is uh I
think I'll just select everything and
just do SX and just scale it up a little
bit like that. Uh so, now you can tell
that it's a little bit more full. And
then I want the bottom a little bit
higher than the rest of them. So, I'm
just going to increase that a little
bit. Just like that. So, the frame is a
little bit bigger down here on the
bottom. Right click, shade auto smooth.
And there we have a computer. All right.
For the mouse pad, uh, or table pad, I
don't know what they call that. Uh, I'm
just going to go into edit mode on this
one. Shift duplicate. Right click,
cancel, be separated by selection. Uh,
make sure this one is selected. Right
click, set origin, origin to geometry,
like so. Just scale it down. Maybe go
into top view. Um, maybe something like
this size.
Maybe a little bit smaller. Then go into
edit mode. Hit A2 and E extrude
everything. Apply our scale to make sure
it works perfectly fine. Okay, cool. GZ.
Move it a little bit down. Just like
that. Um, maybe that's a little bit too
big. So, we can tone that. And I don't
think we need that many segments. Um, so
maybe like three. Cool. Shade auto
smooth. And there we kind of have like
our little mouse pad thing. Uh so for
keyboards generally the workflow is you
go online and you look up keyboard plus
cute um and then you find an image
online and then right click and save the
image to your desktop and then you go
back into Blender shift A and add an
image reference like so and then just
navigate to that image. Nowadays you can
just click and drag it into Blender and
it'll autoimp import. If you don't like
that rotation, you can quickly reset its
rotation by doing alt R and it's
positioned with alt g. And now you can
see it's back at the world center. I
don't want to do that. I'll just do alt
r and then do rz90 just to rotate it a
little bit. Come up here, scale it down
a little bit and uh go into wireframe
and just position it somewhere like
here. And then since we have that, we
can just shift right click to start a
key. Add a plane. Scale it down to match
the key a little bit like so. Go into
edit mode. E to extrude that up. Scale
that down a little bit. If you don't
like wireframe here, um you can also go
into X-ray mode, which is a very common
thing. I use wireframe or X-ray. You
know, I kind of switch between both of
them. You can also adjust your reference
image, which has a lot of properties
like if you want it in front or change
the visibility of it. So, if you come
here, you can see you can see if you
like the opacity level and things like
that. So a lot of options you have um
and and so let me just the typical
workflow then is when you model a key
you add like an array modifier and then
maybe you add another array modifier but
instead of in this way you go like this
way or something and then you just
increase the count and so on so forth
and then when you're done you just apply
them and then for and then since it
becomes one object that's fine but maybe
you want a separate object. So what you
do instead is select one of the keys.
Ctrl L and this will select all the
linked things to your selection and then
you just shift D D D D D D D D D D D D D
D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D
D D D D D D D D to duplicate. Right
click, cancel an P separate by selection
and now you can see it becomes its own
object. Then you just go back into
wireframe, move this somewhere over here
and of course you want to reset its
origin. So right click, set origin
origin to geometry. And now you can see
that you kind of have a key like over
here. Uh, and then you kind of just um
and then you kind of just model the
keyboard from that. There's another
alternative where you use an SVG and
just auto extrude a keyboard, which is
fine, too, but there's a lot of topology
issues there to clean up, and that's a
little bit of an issue. If you're just
going for a render, it's fine. But for
us, there's kind of no reason to go with
an SVG route. Uh, I'm not going to be
using a reference at all because I'm
just going to create something very,
very basic. So, what I'm going to do,
delete this one. and go into edit mode
and select this one. Ctrl L. And this
will select everything that is linked or
connected to your selection. So if I
select all these and do Ctrl L, you can
see it's going to select the entire of
these because all of them are connected.
I'm just going to select one of them and
P and separate by selection. So it
becomes its own object. And then delete
the rest because I want to read my array
modifier that I applied. So now I'll
just add my array modifier and then
adjust it a little bit like this. Go
into edit mode. SZZ just to scale this
down a little bit. Um, a little bit nice
key. Kind of like that. Then let's apply
the B bevel modifier. So, select this
one over here. Copy to selected. Super
cool. Apply scale. Just make sure that
works. Whoa, that looks a little bit too
much. You can see applying scale is
affecting the bevel here. So, this one
I'm going to change down the amount a
little bit. And if it's too fast, you
can hold shift to make it a little bit
smoother. So maybe about 08. Right
click, shade auto smooth. Again, now we
got some cute keys there. For the
keyboard base, what I'm going to do is
honestly probably just shift duplicate
this one. Scale it down. Shift Z a
little bit. Um, GZ, bring that up a
little bit. Right on our keys. Super
super cool. Go into edit mode. Probably
bring up this edge a little bit so it's
kind of a little bit stylized. Come over
here. Go into side view. Just rotate it.
Uh it doesn't have to be exact. You can
match it with snapping if you wanted to.
Uh there's like this align rotation to
target property here, but I'm just going
to eyeball it. Um and sometimes that's
kind of all you need. And then here I
want to add another ray modifier like
so. And then instead of going this way,
I just want to probably go in the Y
direction this time. Super super cool.
and just increase that like so. I don't
want too many. And then probably select
the whole thing and just GZ just to move
it on the local Z-axis. GXX local
X-axis.
Then we can shift Duplicate. Right
click, cancel this one. Get rid of the
array modifier. Get rid of this array
modifier. Go into top view. Just come
over here somewhere. Um maybe scale this
down a little bit. Uh, go into edit
mode, wireframe, and maybe drag this out
a little bit. GX.
Then go back into solid view and just
scale this up along the Y-axis. And now
it looks a little bit too smooth. So we
can just select the top face here, Sy,
and bring that out a little bit. So
there we have our spacebar. And then
let's make sure to apply our scale. And
then GZ just to bring it in a little
bit. Just like that. So there we have
our symbol symbol keyboard. Now, I don't
like I don't like how this is so square.
So, what we can do is go into edit mode,
select these edges. You can actually
just do shift G and select similar
length in this case, and it'll select
all the edges of that object that have a
similar length, which is this one here.
So, we don't have to go around and shift
select all them. We can just select one,
shift G, select similar length, and then
we can do Ctrl +B to actually bevel it
ourselves. And then just add a more
rounded bevel. Kind of like that. If you
want to increase the amount of segments,
you can do controlB and use your mouse
wheel to increase a little bit just so
it looks a little bit smoother. And
there we kind of have our keyboard just
like that. Awesome. And there we kind of
have our keyboard just like that. Um,
and then maybe just scale it up a little
bit just to make it a little bit more
cute. But yeah, there we have our
keyboard. Okay, let's create um probably
a little plant. So, I'm just going to
shift right click, add a plane, um,
scale it down, go here, extrude upwards.
And then I'm going to go and insert just
like here, and E extrude downwards. Kind
of like so. Again, same thing here. Ctrl
L. This time I can just do copy
modifiers. Apply my scale just to make
sure that's fine. Cool. Shade auto
smooth. Maybe too much here. So, maybe
like three segments is okay from far
away. Honestly, maybe even two. Yeah,
like even two from far away. Again,
there's shading issues, but not really a
big deal. Um, I want to select all these
and shift select all these. And I
actually just want to scale that a
little bit. Whoops. Let's turn off
proportional editing. Let's do S. Uh,
let's do alt. Let's do alt s and just
squish it in a little bit. And the
amount is too much for the amount of
segments. So maybe we just add one more
segment there. And increase the amount a
little bit. Just like that.
Um, so there we kind of have uh
something like that. Uh, cute plant sort
of thing. Or actually maybe this can be
like a pen holder. So I'm going to
select this face GZ and move it down
there. And this can be like a pen holder
rather than a plant. Okay. So for the
pens or pencils, we can just shift right
click somewhere, shift A, add a plane,
scale it down. Go into edit mode, E and
extrude upwards. And then we can e
extrude upwards one more time. And just
scale it down like so. And I kind of
wanted to leave it a little bit just
like that. Um, I'm not going to be
giving this a bevel modifier primarily
because it's so far away. I don't think
anyone would be able to tell. And I'm
just going to shift E duplicate. Shift
Z. Move it around. R just to rotate a
little bit. Have it leaning on this one.
It doesn't matter if it's inside of the
other one. Ideally, it shouldn't be
inside of each other, but you know,
you know, sometimes it's just you just
uh got to save some time and uh just
work with it. So there we kind of have
like a cute little pencil holder there.
Okay, now we can probably make like a
flower plot or something. So I'm just
just going to shift right click, add a
plane, scale it down a little bit. Um,
go into edit mode, E and extrude up a
little bit like so. Um, probably inset
here kind of like this. And just E and
extrude downwards. This time I'm going
to give it a subdivision surface
modifier. Now instead of coming here to
give a subdivision service modifier, you
can just hit control or command two or
three or one. And you can see it's going
to adjust the amount of subdivision
level it is. Um so you can do it like
eight, you know, so on so forth. We
don't need that many. I think three is
going to be enough. Shade smooth. And
you can see pretty pretty cool. We kind
of have like a bowl sort of thing
already. Uh and if this wants to be a
little bit down, you can go down just a
little bit. And if you don't like that
the sides are too thin, of course you
can always hold this alt s and just
scale it in again. Uh, super cool. So we
kind of have like a bowl there. Top is a
little too thin for you. You can select
the outer edge here. Um, and just do alt
s and scale it up a little bit, which we
can turn this off with o alt s and just
make it a little bit thicker. Just like
that. Scale down the whole thing. GZ.
And now we kind of have like a cute
little boulder. Three might be too much.
So two is okay. It's starting to get a
little bit weird at two, but from far
away, no one's going to tell. So I'm
just going to leave it at two. That'll
save out on some memory there. So super
cool. We have a ball there. Again, just
to show that if I apply that, what that
looks like. Um you can see kind of what
it looks like here with the subdivision
surface modifier. Also, I'm going to s
shift Z. Maybe just make it a little bit
smaller. For the stem, I'm going to
shift right click somewhere and search
for a basier curve and just add it over
here. Then I'll just go into edit mode.
And you can see as I edit these. Whoops.
As I go here and edit these, you can
kind of get a vibe like that. So with
this one selected, I'm just going to
shift S and selection to cursor, which
will teleport it over there. And
probably just scale this down a little
bit here. And then for this verticy over
here, I'm going to select that. And I
want to lower the bar a little bit so I
can see what I'm working with. I'm going
to go into side view and I'm just going
to bring it up kind of like this. Scale
this. Scale this a little bit and kind
of just make a shape like so. And with
my curve selected, I'm going to come
into the object, the curve data
properties right here. And then I'm
going to go for geometry and under bevel
and round, I'm just going to hold shift
and increase the resolution a little
bit. So, we kind of get a stem like
this. And I don't like how that bottom
is kind of doing that. So, I'm just
going to R Y. Change that a little bit.
Maybe scale it down. Maybe grab this bar
here and just bring it up a little bit.
Boom. Yeah. Honestly, it doesn't really
matter. Um, but there we kind of have
our thing there. Okay. So, for the
flower, what I'm going to do is probably
shift right click somewhere. It doesn't
really matter where. And just add a
cube. Scale it down a little bit.
Control 1 to add that subdivision
surface modifier. Shade smooth. S just
to scale it down. Yeah, it doesn't look
great. We could crank this up if we
wanted to to make it look nicer, but
it'll be far away. Uh, so there we have
the center of our flower. Then for the
leaf itself, we can just actually just
duplicate this and just gy move it over
here. Sy, scale it up a little bit. Um,
like so. Maybe we want to turn this one
to two so we have a little bit more
geometry to work with. Then I'll add a
loop cut here and probably just do sx.
Scale up a little bit and scale this in
kind of like so. Uh, and then let's go
into wireframe to make sure I select the
bottom vertices as well. And kind of
just scale this down here. Maybe make
this taper off a little bit. Maybe add
another loop cut here to bring that up.
And then maybe something over here. Kind
of just plump it up here. Whereas this
kind of goes down just like that. Or we
can turn off proportional editing if you
think that helps. You can turn on
proportional editing like so. Um, but
anyway, there's kind of like our fly
right there. Uh, that's seems like a
little bit too big there. And uh, this I
kind of want to Whoops. Let's go into
wireframe. Um, this I kind of want to
taper just a little bit more.
But again, it's really up to you. And if
you want extra detail cuz you're getting
close, you can add like a loop cut here
and like bring it down sort of thing.
Uh, and then if you want more detail,
you can like add a bevel. Um, and then
you get a small line. Mess with it more
if you want to. Uh, I'm just going to
keep it really simple. Uh, kind of just
like this. Okay. So, now what I want to
do is create a lot of these around this
sort of this object right here. So, what
I'm going to do is shift S and cursor to
selected. It will snap to the origin
point of this object here. Make sure
your origin point is in the center. If
not, again, that's set origin origin to
geometry. And then what we can do is
instead of rotating around the bounding
box center or the average of like the
items kind of thing, we can do around
the 3D cursor. Now you can see when I
hit R, it's rotating around the 3D
cursor rather than the origin point. So
now what I can do is select this, shift
Duplicate, hit R on our keyboard, and
then type in 60 and then hit enter. So
we did all of that in one go. And now
what we can do is just do shift R, shift
R, shift R, shift R, and it'll create
our flower. just for us. Just like that.
So, one more time. Again, just one more
time. Actually, I'm going to do Alt D
this time for link duplicates. So, if
you edit one, it'll edit the other one.
Um, so, sorry, I did say shift D
initially, but I'm going to do alt D.
Anyway, what I'm going to do is hit alt
D
and I'm going to hit R. By default, it's
already grabbed when you hit alt D or
shift D. So, I'm going to hit R instead
and then it will go into rotate mode.
That's type 60. Hit enter. And then
shift R will repeat the last operation
you just did. So we'll do shift R, shift
R, shift R, shift R. And that way we
have six pedals around here. And now if
I edit any single one of them, SC kind
of like that. You can see that it's
going to edit the other one. And that's
because these are instance instances
rather than hard copies. Yeah. So of
course you can always, you know, go here
and edit it if you want. I just, you
know, have some fun like so. Okay. So,
once you get a flower that you like, I'm
actually not going to ever come back to
this flower. So, what I'm going to do is
just select everything and with this
active object, just do Ctrl + J. And now
they're kind of all joined as one single
object. If you have different
subdivision levels on either of them,
it's going to take the one that your
active object has. So, just be uh
conscious of that. Um, but I kind of
like my flower, so I'm just going to
leave it as is. Then I'm going to go
into edit mode, select this vertex here,
shift S, cursor to selected, snap it
there. Select this, shift S, selection
to cursor, and it'll just snap there.
Scale it down a little bit. And then our
rotate it again. It's rotating along my
3D cursor. So let's move this back to
bounding box center. Maybe scale this up
a little bit. Um, and there we kind of
have our cute little flower right there.
Now, of course, if you want to give some
variation to, you know, some of the
flowers so they're not identical, uh,
you can totally do that if you want to.
Just like some slight distortions. Okay.
So, now I want to add like a calendar
sort of thing. So, I'm just going to
shift right click somewhere. I don't
know, maybe here. And let's just put it
over here. And then add a plane. Type
plane. Scale it down just like so. Make
it a little bit longer on the Y, smaller
on the X. Go into edit mode. A E to
extrude up. SX. Just bring it in. Bring
this up a little bit. Kind of just like
that. Then we can go here, apply our
scale, go into edit mode, select these
two faces, hit I to insert, then hit X
to delete those faces. Then holding alt,
select this loop, holding shift and alt
to select this loop. Select both of
them. Then do Ctrl + E and do bridge
edge loops right here. And it'll kind of
fill that inside for us. Just like that.
Um, so I guess that's okay, but I kind
of don't want this bulky thing here. So,
we could just like make that a little
bit smaller. Or if we don't like that,
we can just select these faces and uh
just delete those faces. Then select
these edges like so. Uh, and then since
we have face snapping on, I can just do
GZ and snap it down to this face. Um,
and then we can delete this face because
we no longer need that. Uh, so there we
kind of have a little bit of our
calendar thing. Uh, I feel like it's a
little bit too wide. So what I'm going
to go into edit mode, probably select
this side and just GX a little bit.
Cool. Uh, then we can just copy over a
bevel modifier. Ctrl L, copy modifier
just to see how that looks. Apply scale
shade auto smooth. Cool. Uh, then we
kind of have our calendar thing there.
Um, for the page itself, let's just
select this phase. Shift Duplicate,
right click, cancel. piece already by
selection. And now this will be here.
And we can go into edit mode. A to
select everything and just extrude it
outwards. There we now we kind of have
like a calendar page. Scale it down
maybe just a little bit like that. Okay.
For the rings of the calendar, I think
what would I'm just going to shift right
click somewhere here and add a cylinder.
And instead of 12, maybe we do like 16
this time. Um because it might be
noticeable. So let's just uh scale it
somewhere here. RX90 to rotate it. Uh S
Y just to scale it a little bit. Kind of
like this. Shade auto smooth. Um that's
okay. Let's go into edit mode. Let's uh
insert these faces and delete them. And
then let's shift alt shift alt select
both of those loops like that. Control E
bridge edge loops again. So now we kind
of have a ring. Okay. Okay. So now what
we want to do is add an array modifier.
And um I'm going to put it in the Z
direction. I think it's going into the
local Z direction. And then I just want
four of those just like this. And then
we can like um gy and move it just so
it's kind of even in space here for this
bottom area. H I don't know if we'll
ever see that. But what we can do is go
into wireframe and just select these
vertices down here and just hit X and
delete those vertices. We'll come back
and clean up everything a little bit
later, but now we kind of have like our
little cute little calendar thing here.
Okay, for our speaker, uh, what I'm
going to do is use two really, really
helpful Blender add-ons. So, to get
Blender add-ons these days, you have to
go to their website on here. And the
first one I want to use is Loop Tools.
And this is an extremely popular add-on.
You'll see it in a lot of Blender
tutorials. You can just click and drag
it into Blender and it will install. and
then eventually ask you to enable it.
Um, so I just clicked on it. You can see
I already have it installed, but it'll
just say activate and then you just hit
activate. The other add-on I'm going to
be using is extra mesh objects, which
used to be in Blender natively in the
older versions, but now it's on this
story. Again, you just click and drag it
and install like so. Okay, so for our
speaker, I'm going to shift right click
somewhere and add a round cube. This is
part of the extra objects. And the
reason we're using a round cube instead
of a sphere is just because of the way
that it's created. It'll help us a lot
better than if we used a UV sphere. It
won't be perfect, but it will be better.
So, if I scale it down just arbitrarily,
bring it up a little bit. Let's go into
local view. Let's go into a side view.
Let's go into wireframe. Let's go into
edit mode, vertex select, and possibly
select about here. Make sure we got
everything. Cool. We did. And just do
SZ0. And this will just level out
everything on the same level. Then we
can go back out into regular mode. Just
scale that down a little bit. Cool. Uh
just like so. And since our cursor is
already down at the bottom, what we can
just do right now is object set origin
origin to 3D cursor. That way we'll just
scale and all our transforms come from
there. Then let's go back into solid
view. Let's just select some faces. So
maybe like here, control plus. Um, and
then let's just control shift. And then
let's just do control shift to select
this side. Control shift to select this
side. And then what we can do is just E
and extrude it in just a little bit like
that. And then we can rightclick a shade
auto smooth. And then we can just copy
over a bevel modifier. Ctrl L, copy
modifier. And now you can see we kind of
have a small cute little speaker just
like that. And you can definitely see
that this model also has some shading
issues here. For us, it's not going to
matter because we're so far away. And
fixing it would take too much time and
it's a little too advanced uh for this
video. So, we can just leave it as is.
However, we can fix a little bit of this
if we go into profile and just adjust
the shape a little bit and just kind of
bring that up to like about here. So, it
solves a little bit of our issues, but
again, it doesn't really matter. Okay.
And now I want to make some headphones.
So, I'm going to make a headphone stand.
First, I'm just going to shift right
click somewhere. Shift A. Add a plane.
Scale it down. Uh maybe SX a little bit.
Kind of make it a little bit like that.
Go into edit mode. E to extrude upwards.
Um going to apply my scale. And this
time I actually just want to give the
bevel modifier right now. So I'm going
to do CR L copy modifiers. Just like
that. Shade auto smooth. And then select
this edge. Shift G. Select similar
length. Ctrl +B. Um and then I think we
can go like this. But I don't want it to
go inside. So I'm going to hit C and
it'll just clamp it kind of like that.
Um but I just want it like so. Shade
smooth. Cool. Again, shading issues, but
it's totally okay for us. Uh then in
here, I'm probably just going to insert
a little bit and then just extrude it
down just to give some sort of inset
there. Then I actually want it a little
bit thicker. So I'm just going to select
this edge loop
and then hit alt s
kind of inflate that a little bit there.
or scale along the normals. Cool. Okay.
So, for the stand itself, I'm going to
go really basic. I'm just going to shift
right click somewhere and I'm going to
add a cylinder this time. And I'm at
eight, but maybe I'll go to like 12
because it'll be pretty noticeable.
Whoops, not that. 12. And then I'm just
going to scale it down here. S, shift Z.
Uh, go into edit mode, GZ. Snap it to
the face up there. You don't have to. I
just like having the origin point there.
Um, so maybe something like this. I
don't want it too tall, but I definitely
want it noticeable. Shade auto smooth.
Cool. Maybe have it a little bit
bulkier. Just like that. Add a mirror
modifier. Select this as our object.
Cool. Uh, and then we can just shift
right click over here
and add a maybe we can add another
cylinder. And this time we probably only
need like eight. So I'm just going to
scale it down like so. And then R Y 90.
Just like that. Go into edit mode.
select this this face here and then just
GX and snap it over here. So there we
kind of have like our pole thing. Uh and
then S shift X just to make it a little
bit smaller than the other beams
themselves. Cool. I don't know if that
particularly matches because it kind of
looks like there's edges there. From far
away though with the headphones on
there, I don't think anyone can tell. So
we're just going to leave it as is.
Okay. For the headphones, uh let's start
with a cube. So I'm just going to shift
a add a cube somewhere. This time, let's
go into local view. So, I'm just going
to go into local view. Let's go into a
side view here. Let's do control one
again. That just adds a level one
subdivision surface. Actually, let's do
control 2. Let's right click, shade
smooth. Then, let's just do S uh
probably S Y and kind of just get a
general shape like this. I'm going to
shift D, duplicate that, and just move
it over to the side. And then for this
one, I'm just going to add a simple loop
cut. Um, maybe like over here. So, it
kind of is with this one. Um, and then
maybe I will select this face here and
insert a little bit. And then just e
extrude it inwards a little bit. So we
kind of have a small little inset there.
And then we kind of have our earphones.
Um, and then maybe I'll just scale it up
here a little bit. If you want, you can
add like loop cuts and kind of style it.
But I'm going for some really really
simple um, headphones.
Super cool. So usually headphones are
rotated a little bit when they're
resting. So, we can rotate it both of
these just a little bit. Kind of like
so. Uh, then for the top, we can just
arbitrarily shift right click somewhere
in the center here and add a cube and
scale it down like so. GZ. Bring it up a
little bit. Let's go back here and let's
just eyeball the rotation. Doesn't have
to be accurate. Let's go into edit mode,
wireframe to select all the vertices and
just bring it up kind of just like so.
Cool. So, now what we can do is probably
S Y just to scale it a little bit. kind
of like this. And then we can also give
a control 2 or control one should be
enough subdivision surface modifier. And
now let's add some bracing edges or
control loops which we call them on all
of the sides like so. And then here I
don't want proportional editing. Sx. And
I'm just going to scale it up just like
that. And then let's just do shade
smooth. Recall. So we kind of have that
initial one. And then we can just
duplicate this and make a another one
right on the top. So, this is going to
be overlaying just like this. SX just to
scale it like so. It doesn't matter that
it looks a little bit off. Um, you know,
from far away, no one's going to tell.
So, there we kind of have our other
stuff. Um, so I feel like this is a
little bit too large. Uh, so I'm just
going to scale it along its local
Z-axis, GZ. Move it down a little bit.
And then this one can uh come down a
little bit more. SCZ.
You know, we just need some
differentiation, but I don't want uh it
to be too inaccurate. Even though we're
going stylist, I feel like that's a
little bit better. Cool. And then maybe
expand this a little bit more. So, what
I'm going to do now is just duplicate
this. Uh, and then what I'm going to do
is select all of these and do S Y and
then hit Y again for the local Y-axis
and then do negative one. And this is a
really quick way just to mirror your
object. So again, if I show that on like
a extruded cube, let me just show you
real quick. And I Well, oh, sorry, wrong
wrong face. If I extrude this and I do s
Y minus one, you can see it's just going
to create that, right? So S Y - one is
going to go like that. Now, I want to
create that thing that you put on your
head or rests on your head. I don't know
what that's called. Now, there's quite a
few methods to approach this. I'm going
to be using a much more simple method,
but it works for what we're going to be
doing. So, what I'm going to do is I
want the it to be a little bit bigger.
So, I'm going to select these three
faces. Remember, we added these edge
loops, guard loops here. So, they are
also part of the top face. Make sure to
select that. Shifty duplicate, right
click, cancel the movement, and just
scale it up. Scale it up just a little
bit like that. Cool. So, now we have
something sort of like that. All right.
Let's do that again. Let's shift
duplicate that. And let's go into a side
view here. And let's bring this one up
to like where you think um your earphone
headrest would be or like the tip of it
pretty much. And then you rotate it
arbitrarily to kind of get it
perpendicular to whatever axis you're
working on. In my case, it's Y. And then
once it's near like you can just do S Y
and then zero. And that'll just flatten
out everything to make sure it's up
completely perpendicular. Let's make
sure we're in wireframe to select
everything.
So, uh, you can just guess, but you can
always make adjustments later. So, if
you're too high, too low, it's not
really a big deal. So, now what we can
do is select this, Ctrl L, just to
quickly select linked or just select
each one or, you know, control, you
know, make sure you're actually
selecting this one and not the inner
one. Cool. And now what we can do is
hold shift and select these as well. And
then what we can do is Ctrl + E bridge
edge loops. And you can see that okay,
doesn't look great, but we can fix this.
So if I come Whoops, I accidentally
exited the menu. That's totally okay.
You can just hit F9 to open your last
menu of your operation.
So what we can do, I might have
different immediate defaults than you
do. So just make sure to check for that.
And what we can do is increase the
number of cuts. And you can see already
we kind of have something like that. Uh
yeah. So I think six cuts is enough for
us. I don't think we need any more than
that. So um let's just check. Yeah, that
looks okay. And then we can just do
shade smooth like so. And then there we
kind of have our top there. Now
generally what we should have done was
probably put some sort of mirror object
here and not rotate these. That way it
wouldn't be as confusing as what we're
doing now. But that's totally okay
because we can learn from that. So what
we can do is select this edge loop here.
Go back into a side view. And now we
definitely need proportional editing.
And just uh increase this a little bit
until we get something that we like.
Let's add a mirror modifier now. And
here we wanted to do it along the Y. And
then let's go into edit mode. G YY. Just
move it out like so.
Just so it's kind of like over here
again. We want to turn on clipping. GY.
Move it inside. So it's like so. Let's
go into wireframe. Make sure these are
kind of out. Cool. Um, and now we can
just I guess we'll work from this
location instead. So, GZZ. Um, like so.
And kind of just bring it out
arbitrarily.
Center just a little bit. Uh, and now
what we can do is actually delete this
one because it's mirroring this entire
thing. So, now we can just plug this in
here somewhere arbitrarily like so. Uh,
then we can just select the top cuz I
want it a little bit thicker. Ctrl L.
And uh probably let's turn off
proportional editing. SX and just give
it some depth a little bit there. Maybe
select these top ones over here like so.
And alt S and make those a little bit
wider than the other ones. And then if
you want the padding inside, you can
totally do that. You can just like
select these faces here. I'm holding
control just to select those faces.
Right. Shift Eyee duplicate. Right
click. Cancel. Eextrude out a little
bit. Cool. Uh cool. And there we kind of
have like a a little bit more of a puff
there. And then probably SX just to
scale it up a little bit. Um maybe
select these alt s just to make it a
little bit more puffy. I don't know.
Really up to you there. Uh so yeah, a
little bit messy, but we did end up
getting our headphones. So that's
totally okay. So let's just scale that
down. Let's come over here. Let's shift
right click. And then with everything
selected, shift S. Selection to cursor
keep offset. So keep everything. So keep
everything in line. If you do shift S
selection to cursor, it'll snap every
origin points object to that. So do
shift S selection to keep offset. Scale
it down or maybe something like so. GZ.
And uh we can just kind of place it just
like that. Uh so not particularly
accurate. We can just scale this down on
the Y a little bit. Scale this down. I
want it a little bit more stylized. Um
so maybe that's a little bit too much.
Now, uh, these I don't want to touch.
So, I'm just going to g y move those
over here.
Um, g y move that back here. Uh, so now
we kind of have our headphones here. And
of course, we can just adjust this a
little bit. Um, really up to you. And I
think we can actually just join these
now. Uh, so let's apply our mirror
modifier for this one. And, um, yeah,
let's select this. Select all of these.
Probably just Ctrl + J and join them
now. And let's crank this up to two.
Cool. Then what we can do is just, I
don't know, play around with it until
you get something that you like. And
then now we can go into edit mode and go
into wireframe. Um, and probably just,
you know, rotate these up a little bit
with proportional editing just so we get
like a curve or something. Uh, maybe
select a little bit more here. Um, let's
include the bottom here as well.
Same thing over here. Let's just rotate.
Get something closer.
Um maybe all of these like so.
Cool. And it looks a little bit too
small to everything. So, let's just
scale up everything kind of just like
that. Yeah. So, maybe if you watch this
at the start of the video, I'll talk
about how I start off with a room. But,
I actually want to go for more like a
open vibe rather than a room. Or else I
think I'm going to actually get rid of
this. I'll just keep it for like a maybe
collection, but I don't think I'll be
using that anymore. So, I'm just going
to hide all that. Then, shift S, cursor
to world origin, shift A, and I'm just
going to add a plane, and just scale it
up like so. Then, I go into edit mode,
select these edges, and just extrude
upwards. And let's delete this face
here. Um, and let's give all of these,
well, let's go back to object mode,
apply our scale first. Let's go into
edit mode and let's just control B and
bevel and give it some a bunch of loop
cuts just like that. Shade smooth, shift
S. Bring it out just like that.
Cool. So now we kind of have like a
domain that we can work with, which we
can also edit a little bit later if we
want to. So now what we can do is let's
just uh select these and whoops,
deselect that with control and just move
this somewhere else because I want my
computer to live here. So, for Okay, so
for a gaming PC, I'm going to shift
right click somewhere and I'm going to
add a plane. Probably go into top view
and kind of just give a rough shape of
what I want my uh PC to look like. So, I
think I'm going to go like over here,
add some loop cuts here. Um maybe add
some loop cuts here. I don't actually
know. So, that's why I'm kind of just
adding a little bit more than I normally
should. Um we might only need a few. I
don't really know. Um, so it's fine. Uh,
but maybe we can have like a gaming PC
like this.
And then we can select these two here
and probably hit F to fill. So we kind
of get like a small little corner there.
Um, and then actually maybe we want a
corner here as well. So we could like
drag that in. Or or what we can do is
actually just delete those edges and um
just hit F to fill that. So we kind of
have like a more more stylized
um here. I don't maybe I just maybe I
don't want it like this on that side. So
here now we can have something that I
like. Let's go into edit mode, hit A and
just E and extrude that outward. That'll
be the base. Then we can hold then we
can just copy our modifier right now.
Just like so. Shade auto smooth. Cool.
So there's kind of like our base right
there for our computer. Okay. For the
glass center, what we can do is just use
this. So, let's go into edit mode. Um,
doesn't really matter. I'm going to hold
Alt to select the edge loop. Uh, and it
seems like we probably messed up
somewhere because it's not selecting the
whole edge loop, but it's totally okay.
It doesn't really matter. We can hold
shift alt and just select the remaining
stuff. Um, and then I'm think I'm just
going to hit E and extrude upwards on
the Z-axis kind of like so.
Um, then let's go into face select. Hold
alt to select the entire loop there.
Then let's go into face select and just
select this whole loop here and P and
separate by selection. So now it becomes
its own thing. And just scale it in.
Oops. S shift Z a little bit. Just like
that. Scale it up to a height that you
like. Maybe like S. Like so. And then
for the top, shift D. Duplicate this and
bring it over here. Let's just readjust
everything so they're kind of sitting on
top. So there we kind of have like our
gaming PC. And this side looks a little
bit too cornered. So what we can do is
go into edit mode and select these
vertices. Um let's make sure we select
everything. So we can go into wireframe.
Just select over here. Doesn't matter if
you select the back. You can hold
control and box select to deselect
those. So it seems like we got
everything here. So what we can do is go
into solid GX and just move it up a
little bit. Again, we're getting some
shading issues, but that's totally okay.
So yeah, and now we can just adjust it.
Maybe these can be bigger. So instead of
uh bounding box center, let's change
individual origins. Make that a little
bit bigger. Change back to bounding box
center. Okay. So when it comes to the
GPU fans and things like that, basically
it kind of looks like this. And then you
have your fan in the center like here.
Let me just show you what most people
would do is they would add a plane like
over here. You can just watch for now.
They would add a plane and then they
would probably add a cylinder. So let's
just add a cylinder. Come over here and
just place it in the center. GZ like
here. Add a boolean modifier. So if you
used design software before, you've
probably seen something like this. It
also exists in 3D. Then you just select
difference, select the cutout object as
your cutting out object. And you can see
that okay, now it's cutting out
something here. You can't see it yet
because it's not applied. But if you
want to see it move around, you can come
over here, go into object, go into
viewport display right here, and then
instead of texture, change it to bounds.
Now, the object itself is still the
same. But now you can see if you were to
apply this, how it would cut out from
your object. I'm just going to change
that back to textured. Then let's come
back over here and apply this boolean
modifier. So now I can just delete this.
And you can see that okay, indeed, we
have something like this. for you it
might work properly perfectly fine um
and you would have like no issues. So it
might work fine for you. Here you can
see like okay it's not terrible uh and
it doesn't seem like there's too many
shading issues. So if you're just going
for something like this it doesn't
really have any issues, right? But look
what happens when you shade auto smooth.
You can start seeing some a little bit
of shading issues right here and over
here and over here. Honestly, it might
not be a big deal if you're from far
away. However, if you are close, it
might be noticeable and it might look a
little bit weird. You can cover that up
with possibly normal textures and some
other sort of trick, but it's kind of
better just to avoid this entirely. Now,
you definitely can fix this up if you
want to, but that's a little too
advanced and too timeconuming for this
beginner course. So, we're going to
avoid this method and we're going to use
a different method. So, instead, what
I'm going to do is shift A and add a
plane and bring it up over here like so.
and go into edit mode and subdivide it
probably like three times like so. Then
I'm going to go into top view. I'm going
to select the probably these faces right
here. I'm going to rightclick and again
loop tools and change it into a circle.
Then I'm going to hit I for like a guard
loop something over here. Let's go back
and just select these out a little bit
and scale it up a little bit. Just like
that. Now what we can do is hit control
minus just to less our selection or
again that's select more or less and
then less right here. And then we can
just delete these interfaces.
So now we're left with this place for
our fan. We can actually select this
edge loop outside because it's a little
bit too big and we don't want all that
extra space. And then we can actually
just delete these faces. So now we kind
of have something like this. Super super
cool. And now when I add a solidify
modifier like so. We could just extrude,
but I'm just going to add a solidify
modifier. Uh then we can add an array
modifier kind of like this. Let's put it
up to three. Like so. Do shade auto
smooth. Okay. Still no issues. Now let's
copy over our bevel modifier. Ctrl L.
Copy. Whoops. Sorry. Just come over here
and copy to selected. Cool. And now you
can see that the shading is a little bit
better on here. It's still not perfect,
but it's it's better than what it used
to be. Now, the issue here is that it's
beveling on both sides. So, what we can
do is temporarily hide our array
modifier in edit mode. And since we
don't actually have the faces yet
because we're using solidify, let's
actually just apply it right now. Let's
go into edit mode, face select, hold
control, face select that, then shift
over here. Now, just control and select
that as well. Pick the shortest path X
and delete those faces. Let's go back
and set our array modifier again. Cool.
So, we kind of have something like this.
Okay. Now, we can apply our array
modifier. And let's fill in the gap on
the side here. So, if we go into edit
mode, what you can do is select the face
faces like this. Sorry, let me go back.
Like this. And then hit F. And instead
of having to select all of these and
hitting F every single time, you can
just select this edge and hit F and hit
F and just keep hitting F until it
repeats. So just one more time, we
select these three edges, hit F, select
this edge, hit FF, and it'll
automatically fill that just for us. So
now we kind of have a thing for our GPU
thing. Again, there's still some shading
issues which you can fix with another
modifier called weighted normal, and
this will help a little bit too. Uh,
again, still not perfect because this is
a little bit too close to each other.
So, if you want to fix some of that
pinching, you totally could. Uh, but
again, it's going to be good enough for
us. So, we'll just leave it like so. And
then, of course, we can scale it. Let's
see. Maybe something like this. Make it
a little bit more thick and stylized.
Uh, and then for the fan, what we can do
is I think this is actually already in
the center, which is actually really
nice. Uh, so we can just do shift s
cursor to selected which will just snap
it there. Um, let's go to object mode
and add it. We can always join it later.
And let's add a cylinder. I don't think
we need 12 because it's going to be so
small. So maybe eight will suffice. Um,
so sorry, my num lock key is off. So
eight. Yeah, it doesn't look great from
closeup, but from far away it'll look
more than okay. Um, and then just scale
it down a little bit. Kind of just like
that. So, for the blades itself, you
could totally import like a fan
reference just to go off it. But,
honestly, I'm just going to eyeball it.
So, I'm going just going to add a plane
um arbitrarily and then maybe go here
and just move this slightly over here.
Whoops. Let me turn off proportional
editing. And then maybe move another one
right here. Um I don't know. Try and get
a regular shape of a blade. And then
over here, maybe something over here.
And we definitely want to loop cut down
the center just to give it some shape
over here. Um, so I'm kind of just
eyeballing everything. Uh, but you could
definitely import a reference if you
need to. Maybe rotate some of these. Um,
maybe maybe a little bit. I don't
actually know. But I feel like this kind
of looks good enough for a blade. So
what we can do is add a solidify
modifier.
Just increase the thickness a little
bit. And then we can add a subdivision
surface. Uh, just like that. kind of
looks like a blade. Shade smooth. Little
bit of shading issues. That's fine. Then
we can probably Now we can uh let's go
into local view so it's not glitching
out. Now we can probably move with
proportional editing. Let's change our
sphere of influence here. So here we
might want a small curve here. Let's
bring it down a little bit. Maybe like
so. Doesn't have to be accurate. Up here
we can probably bring it up a little
bit. Um maybe increase that. Same thing
here.
Uh maybe bring this area down. I don't
know. We'll see. Um kind of like
something like that. So, okay. So, that
looks good enough for me. If you want to
play around with yours, you totally can.
Um but that'll be all for the blade
here. So, we can use the same method we
did last time. Let's select this. Shift
S cursor to selected. Let's change this
to 3D cursor. Let's select this. Okay.
So, I think I want six again. So, what
I'm going to do is shift D again. Hit R
and then type in 60. Hit enter, shift R,
shift R, shift R, shift R. And there we
have six. And honestly, I think I'm
going to hold Alt and just increase this
by one. That way it looks a little bit
better. Actually, no. I'm just going to
undo that. And I think it'll look fine.
Just like that. Uh, so anyway, let's
select these and hit F3, convert to
mesh. That'll just that's just a faster
way of applying all your modifiers.
So you can see all my modifiers for all
these are gone now. Um, and then what we
can do is select all these and just join
it here. Kind of just like this. Cool.
Uh, and then this one. Um, if you don't
want to change anything, what you can do
is apply bevel and weighted normal. Uh,
so now we can just duplicate this and
over here. So I'm going to do GX and
move it over here. You could use an
array modifier if you want, but I'm just
going to eyeball it cuz no one's going
to notice and it's faster that way. So
I'm just going to leave them separate
for now. Uh, we'll come back to this a
little bit later. Um, and then let's
just place it in our computer somewhere.
So maybe, oops, let's do again. I
accidentally have it on 3D cursor. So
let's make a bounding box center again.
RX 90. Um, and just move it somewhere.
That kind of looks good. Uh, and we can
temporarily change this one to
um, we can go into viewport display and
change this one to wire or bounce. Uh,
in this case, I think I'm just going to
go with wire. So this will be a little
bit more noticeable here. And it seems
like on this side I did not uh fill it
in. So let's just go into local view, go
into edit mode again. We can select
these, hit F, select this F FF, fill
that in. We could have also just cut
this in half and use a mirror modifier
on both of these because it's the same.
Um but you know, it doesn't really
matter for us. Uh yeah. So what we can
do now is let's just select this entire
thing to go into local view like so.
Make sure we don't have anything else
selected. Cool. Head into local view
here. And let's just shift right click
somewhere and add a I don't know plane
just over here. Go into edit mode. Uh
just go into wireframe. Kind of get
something that we like. We can turn off
proportional editing. And this will be
like our water cooler thing. Honestly,
it doesn't really have to be that cool
or anything. Maybe extrude again. Maybe
e extrude again. Maybe, you know, it
doesn't really matter. I'm just kind of
doing whatever honestly. So this is like
our GPU or something. Maybe it looks a
little bit weird. Whatever. Doesn't
really matter. Looks like I didn't
select those fans. Oh well, it doesn't
matter. Okay, so for the tubes, we're
going to do the same thing we did for
the plant stems. Shift A, search for a
curve. Um, nums curve, basier curve.
Doesn't really matter, honestly. I'm
just going to go for basier. Let's go
into top view. Uh, select this verticy.
Let's just scale that down so we can see
what we're doing. Since our cursor is
over here, shift S, selection to cursor.
It'll jump it over there. Um, kind of
like so. And then we can just move this
one as well. kind of just arbitrarily R
R like so. And of course, we want to
give it some depth just so we can see
what we're doing. So again, that's in
our data object properties and just
increase the depth just a little bit.
Kind of like that. Here, we can go into
side view. This will kind of help out a
lot. And if you need more geometry, you
can just hit E to kind of extrude it
like so. Rotate appropriately, scale it,
whatever you need to um, you know, kind
of have some water tubes and things like
that. Uh, then we can obviously
duplicate it. Oh, that looks like a This
looks really weird. So, let's go into
wireframe to make sure that's not messed
up. Cool. Something like that. The same
thing with this one. Let's just fix
that. It's got some issues here. Um, so
maybe over here. And then this one can
be lower hanging. This one can be a
little bit maybe hanging down here like
that. Uh, we don't want these inside. So
the less overlap we have the better. Um
but you know it's not it's not a
complete big deal. I think that's good
enough. So let's just go out and yeah.
So I'm going to leave this like this for
now just so we can see everything. So
the front faces I think I'm going to
cover up whereas the side faces are
going to be glass. So we'll just see
this. Um and that should be good enough.
Okay. Let's add a really really cute
character now. So we can just shift
somewhere and probably let's add a
plane. Let's go scale it down a little
bit. Let's go into local view actually.
So we get rid of everything. E extrude
it up. Apply our scale. And let's do
control 2 for like um shade smooth.
Maybe control 3 actually just so we get
something a little more round like this.
Maybe add a loop cut kind of like here.
Uh so we have something that kind of
looks like a plush. Maybe SX kind of a
little bit like so. Uh then we can go
into front view and maybe for the eyes
we just shift a also add a cube this
time. Um control 2 for that shade
smooth. Come over here and add a mirror
modifier like so. Come over here and do
Y and X. Scale it up a little bit. Maybe
SZ. Cool. Cool. Cool. And then maybe we
can have some ears. So, I'm just going
to duplicate this and uh maybe scale it
like this. Sx kind of like this. SZZ on
the local Z-axis. Go into edit mode.
Probably insert this a little bit. Um
there we kind of have like a flat sort
of face thing. Let's go into edit mode
and scale this XX. Just bring it down a
little bit like so. Um
cool. Let's also just copy this mirror
modifier. So, copy modifiers. There we
kind of have something cute. So for the
whisker thing, what I'm going to do is
go into a side view, shift right click
somewhere in the center. And this time
I'm going to shift A and this time if
you come into mesh, you'll see this new
thing here called a single verticy. And
it'll add a single verticy only. And
that comes with the extra objects add-on
that we installed a little bit earlier.
So instead, what we can do is do origin
and verticy mirrored. And this will kind
of just save us a lot of issues. By
default, it'll jump us into edit mode on
this. Just make sure you're in vertex
select so you can see it. And then you
can hit E and just extrude it outward
and into like a shape of a whisker. Just
like that. Let's make sure the mirror
modifier is in the correct direction.
And then here we can go into wireframe
kind of just to see it a little bit
better. So now you can just shape it how
you want. And if you want verticy here,
you can just do CtrlB and then hit V
just to split it up a little bit and
increase your mouse wheel just to get
some more vertices if you need more
vertices in between your other ones.
Additionally, you can do CtrlR just for
a loop cut just to place a single one in
between just in case you need that. I
think I just need four. And that kind of
is good enough for my whisker. But, you
know, make your whisker however you
want. Okay. Now, for the whisker,
instead of using a curve like we did
earlier, let me go into side view. The
reason I'm not going to be using a curve
this time is because, you know, it kind
of has this issue and then you have to
fix that. I mean, we've dealt that with
before, but it's just better not to do
that again. And now that we have this
extra objects add-on, what we can do if
you come into mesh and go into single
verticy, you can see this thing here
called add single verticy. If you click
on it, it'll automatically bring you
into edit mode and it just it's
literally just a single verticy. Make
sure you're invertex select and hit E
just to extrude it out. And then kind of
just shape and then just shape it out
into like a whisker sort of thing. If
you need more vertices, you can just hit
Ctrl R and place some loop cuts in
between. Now, it's not really a loop
cut, but yeah, I just call it loop cut
anyway because it's the same hotkey.
Here, you can do Ctrl +B and then do V
if you want to increase the amount. And
you can use your middle mouse button to
increase the amount of vertices there,
like so if you want it more smooth. I
think I just need four. So, that's all
I'm going to be doing. And I'm just
going to shape it into like a whisker
sort of thing.
So, there we kind of have our whisker.
Now what we can do is actually F3 and
open the global menu and convert this to
a curve. You can see it's in object
convert to curves which means if you
come up here object convert to curve
it's also there as well but I usually
just use the global menu and search for
it because I know about it. Uh so now
that it's a curve we can come into the
curve object data properties and like we
did for the stems and the pipes and
everything we can just increase the
depth holding shift just to make it a
little bit slower like so. Then you'll
notice that they don't automatically
fill the caps. So we can just click fill
the caps just like that. Right click,
shade smooth. I think that's fine. But
if you want, you can add like a
subdivision. So like control 2, and
that'll be really smooth. We're really
far away, so I'm just going to undo that
and leave it really low poly, kind of
just like this. Cool. And now what we
can do is add a mirror modifier just
like so. Make sure it's on the Y-axis.
Um, and that looks okay. But if you want
to do it for the object, you can totally
do the object itself. That way when you
go into edit mode, you can kind of like
adjust it like so. Uh anyway, let's just
get out of local view and uh scale this
down and place it on your desk
somewhere. So, what we can do is
actually make a baby Mr. Whiskers. Shift
Duplicate. Um G, shift Z somewhere
smaller, kind of like a little bit like
so. Uh Sz just to scale it down a little
bit. Make it a little bit more plump and
round than Mr. Whiskers himself. and
then scale it down. There we have There
we have Mr. Whisker's kid. Mr. Whisker's
son right there. Super super cool. Let's
add a quick coffee somewhere. So, let's
just shift A and add a cylinder like so.
Maybe let's do like 16 this time. Scale
it down a little bit. Uh, bring it up.
GZ. Go into edit mode. A GZ and snap it
here with face snapping. Um, right
click, shade auto smooth. Go into edit
mode. Select this. inset and just
extrude it downwards. Apply a bevel
modifier like so. Uh then we can just
copy our bevel modifier over here. Uh
copy modifier. Let's apply our scale
just like so. And then maybe adjust the
mount a little bit. Maybe we can inflate
this a little bit with alt s. Cool. Um
and then for the handle, let's just
shift a add a Taurus. 48 might be too
many. So maybe we can do like 24. Uh
that's okay. Then we can just right
click shade smooth. And then R Y90. Just
bring it down kind of just like here. Go
into edit mode. Sorry, local view. Go
into edit mode. Wireframe. Select these
vertices. Whoops. Let's go into
wireframe. And then select these
vertices. All deleted those. And um
there we kind of have our mug. I'm just
going to join that right now. So they
become the same thing. Uh and then I'm
just going to apply this bevel modifier
and just join here right now. And then
just shade smooth. That way we kind of
just have our coffee cup uh by default.
Okay. Okay, for the chair, let's just
start with maybe a plane and just bring
it up GZ. Kind of get a shape that we
want. Let's add a subdivision surface
modifier of two. And let's just add a
loop cut over here. Maybe a loop cut
over here. Maybe squeeze this down just
a little bit. So, we kind of have
something like that. And now, let's just
add a solidify modifier just to see how
that will look. Okay. And let's put this
before our subdivision surface modifier.
Now, let's do shade smooth. Cool. It
doesn't look too bad.
Uh, so what we actually need to do is
actually apply our solidify modifier.
Now, now that we have more geometry to
work with, then we can just inflate this
a little bit. And then maybe add two
bracing loops right here. SC a little
bit. Um, just to brace it up. And there
can be our sort of uh RZ 90. And this
can kind of be just our cherry bottom.
Just like that. Super be super cool. We
can select this. We'll do shift s cursor
to selected. Snap that right there. And
let's add a cylinder for the base. I
think 16 is too many. So, we can do like
12. Scale that down a little bit. Maybe
something like so. Cool. And let's go
into edit mode. Bring that down. Whoops.
I don't want to extrude yet. Bring that
down a little bit. And then we can E,
right click, cancel the movement. Scale
it up first. And then E, extrude it
down. Whoa, that's too big. But that's
totally okay. Let's go into local view.
Let's just hold alt s and with this loop
selected. So we only want it a little
bit bigger. Just like that. Let's do
shade auto smooth. Kind of like that.
All right. So let's make our table leg.
I'm just going to go into local view.
Let's just go into side view. Doesn't
really matter. Then let's come over
here. Let's uh let's do a cube this
time. And let's just go start over here.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's go into
wireframe. Make sure we select
everything. Let's just bring it down
kind of something just like that. Now
what we can do is same thing we did
before. Rotate this arbitrarily parallel
to the X Saxis and then Whoops. And then
do Sz0 just to flatten it out there.
Then we can possibly put it around here
or something. Then select these as well.
Remember it's selecting everything. It
has to have the same amount of sides and
geometry and everything. Ctrl + E bridge
edge loops and just increase the number
of cuts. Like so. Maybe two is good
enough cuz no one's going to be looking
at it that much. So, right click, shade,
auto smooth. Super super cool. And then
we just S Y scale in. Well, actually,
maybe I'll just leave it a little bit
more blocky.
Cool. And then for the bottom here, we
can just shift right click somewhere
arbitrarily. Shift A. And this time, we
can have another cylinder. So, I'm just
going to search for that. Add that down
there. 12. I think we might be able to
live with 10 since it's so small. So,
let me just do 10. Cool. RX90. Just like
that. S Y. Make it kind of small. Scale
it up. S Y GZ. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. S
Y
GZ. And then now we can have the table
the cap for it. So we just go into edit
mode, hold control to pick the shortest
path. Well, I guess that's not the
shortest path. So now we can just hold
control and select those possibly here.
Shift Duplicate, right click, cancel.
Let's hit alt S just to scale it up a
little bit so there's like a small
little gap there. And then alt E,
extrude along normals. And then just
bring that up there. And now we kind of
have our little wheel with our cap
there. Do all of these stuff. Uh, so
maybe over here, Ctrl L, copy modifiers.
And let's just apply our scale just to
make sure everything works. Looks cool
actually. I mean, it doesn't look bad. I
mean, this kind of looks bad, but from
far away, no one's really going to be
taking a look that deeply. Okay, let's
just apply these modifiers. Um, so we
can join them together. Uh, so this
seems okay. Let's just join them
together. Ctrl J. Uh, cool. Just like
so. And now we're going to do that same
exact thing. Let's do shift s cursor to
selected. Go into top view. Let's select
this. I think I want six legs again. So
that's going to be 60°. Let's change
this to 3D cursor. Okay. So, same thing.
Let's just uh go in wireframe. Um,
position this correctly. I think that's
okay. Then shift D, R60.
Don't touch anything. Shift R, shift R,
shift R, shift R. There we have these.
Now we can just uh rotate these a little
bit. Um just so it's offset. I don't
like how this is like parallel to the
chest. Uh sorry to the chair. Um and I
think we can just convert these to
meshes. Now if you want to edit them,
you totally can. But I'm just going to
convert them and then just join it with
this object right here. And again, if
you do want to edit them, you totally
have the option to, right? You can go
into wireframe, probably go into edit
mode and select over here. Uh you can
deselect these um and then you can still
adjust stuff like this. Same thing with
the legs, right? You can go in the side
view and select the legs and then adjust
the legs. So you still have your option.
It's a little more destructive by
applying it. So I would honestly
probably adjust it first before joining.
You know, that's that's uh kind of up to
you and and what you want to do. And
then for the back of the chair, I think
that will also just be a cube with
control 2 subdivision. Shade shade shade
auto smooth. Bring it down. Maybe
something like this. Sz. Um, cool.
Something like that. Maybe add some
bracing edge loops. Maybe just like two
here. Sy. I want it a little bit plumpy.
Maybe in the center. Uh, we can have one
there. And then maybe one over here. And
then we can do sx and kind of like plump
it out just a little bit. Like you know
if you want to style maybe you add
something like here. I don't know. Uh
kind of up to you. But I'm just going to
keep it really really simple. And for
the back we can use probably the same
exact method we've been using. Let's go
into wireframe. Shift A. Add a cube.
Scale that down. Let's go into edit
mode. Wireframe E. Just extrude it up.
Rotate a little bit somewhere around
here. Cool. Uh, scale it. Maybe scale it
up a little bit. E, extrude again.
Rotate it. Um, I don't honestly I don't
even know if we need to bridge edge
loops this time. I feel like just doing
it manually is good enough. And then
subdivision surface about control 2. Add
two bracing loops on this side. S Y
scale that up kind of like that. Um, and
then maybe and then two and then
definitely two on this side. Okay. So to
move these uh new tip, you can do G for
grab and then hit G again and it'll kind
of slide along the edge here. So hold
alt to select this whole edge loop. GG
to move along the edge to bring it up
there. G alt to select this loop. GG to
slide it down and brace this edge like
there. And then shade, right click,
shade, auto smooth. And there we kind of
have our little thing right there. Uh
honestly, I don't know if it's worth
adding all that topology for this. So
I'm actually going to delete that. And I
think I'm just going to shift Duplicate
this. Shift S selection to cursor.
Scale that down. S Y kind of like this.
And just uh probably do something
something like this actually, which is
really simple. Um but it gets the job
done. And then I'm just going to move
this here. Cool. And the center kind of
just like that. So very a lot more
simpler. And uh maybe we add some loop
cuts here and one down here for And we
don't want this to be a little bit
inflated or maybe you do. I'm just going
to Ctrl X to get rid of those bracing
edges right there. So we effectively
have the same thing here. But now it's
kind of like that. Uh and then maybe we
want a cushion. So I'm actually just
going to select these faces. Shift
Duplicate P separate by selection. Go
into edit mode E and just extrude that
up a little bit. Um, and let's just make
it really inflated here. Just place it
right on top. Just like that. Uh, and
then maybe we can change the SL shape
just a little bit. So, GG just to make
it not completely perfect. Move it up a
little bit here. GX. Move this. And this
will kind of be like the back stand. And
the And honestly, like stylistically,
this kind of looks bad compared to how
bulky everything is. So maybe we
overkilled on six, which is fine because
we can just select everything. Let's go
into wireframe actually and make sure we
select one of everything of each of
these except one of them. Um, so maybe
something like this. Let's do Ctrl L and
delete vertices. Cool. We got rid of
everything. This one we can just do Ctrl
L. Uh, let's select here as well. Ctrl L
P. Separate by selection. Very cool. So
just like that, we can do is just select
this. Go into local view. Let's go to
top view. Reset the rotation a little
bit. Well, I guess I kind of skewed it.
Oh well, that's fine. Um, let's go back
into outside of local view with this
still orthographic. Let's go into
wireframe here.
Go into edit mode and just move uh move
adjust this kind of a little bit like
so. Um, so it's not like completely
outside of the desk. So maybe something
like this. Cool. Honestly,
it might be even smaller like this. Uh,
which is a little bit weird, but um I
think it will work. I think it'll work
for the stylistic look that we're going
for. Uh, yeah. So, I just did that same
shift R thing. Um, so I don't want to
keep showing you that and waste your
time, but this actually definitely looks
a lot better than what we had
originally. It's still a weird sort of
proportion. Um, but you know, it's it
was a lot it is a lot better than what
we had originally. And let's just make
this a little bit more bulkier with some
support loops. S uh sy probably and just
make it a little bit bulkier there.
Cool. Yeah, but honestly, you know, just
spend as much time as you want to. I
don't want to waste your time here just
uh nitpicking the models every single
time. Um, but you know, it definitely
looks better than what we had
originally. All right, let's bring back
our room. So, I'm just going to
reactivate that just so we can see it
again. Let's make sure. Okay, we can
join these now. So, we can just join
these. And let's just move these up all
kind of just like this. All right, let's
add like a chest here or something. Uh,
or drawer. I don't know what they
actually call it. So, I'm just going to
add a plane here. Shift Z. Go into edit
mode. E extrude it upwards. That looks
way too big. So, I'm just going to S
shift C it a little bit. That looks
about right. Let's go into edit mode.
Well, let's apply our scale. Go into
edit mode. Select this inset a little
bit like here. I think that looks okay.
Then we can add two loop cuts like so.
And we can just scale them arbitrarily.
I kind of want three here. So just kind
of eyeballing it. Maybe around here is
okay. Then we can select this. Then we
can select this face. Hit P and separate
by selection. Then select go back in
here. Hold alt to select these and shift
and just Ctrl + X to dissolve those. And
then we can also just delete this face
here. So now we kind of have this thing
by itself. Let's object. So origin
origin back to geometry.
Uh and then this will be like one of our
drawers. So what we can do is let's go
into wireframe here. Just E and extrude
it out a little bit like here. I don't
know if we want to see the inside, but
maybe we do. So let's go into local view
here. Let's go and just inset here and
then extrude downwards. This way we kind
of have like a you know a storage
container like so. And for the handle we
can just add two loop cuts here and
bring this down just so like so. GZ. And
then actually maybe we add one more here
and one more here.
And then let's just bring this down like
so. And if I go out. Yeah, that looks
that looks pretty good. Maybe bring it
down a little bit more. Super cool. And
then let's add a little bit of a gap
there. so the hand can fit in. Let's
just copy the bevel modifiers now.
Sorry. Yeah, bevel modifiers. Come over
here. Let's just do copy to selected.
Let's apply our scale. That looks great.
Let's add an array modifier here. We
want it in the Z direction. So, let's
get rid of that. Let's just move it in
the Z direction.
That looks great. Then we add three. And
now it's looking a little too small. So,
we can just go into edit mode and scale
that up a little bit. Bring it down a
little bit and then just lower the gap a
little bit. Kind of like that. Okay,
that looks pretty good for a drawer.
Maybe we can increase the amount here
just a little bit. And let's make sure
we shade shade auto smooth for both of
these shading issues here. I think this
can be fixed with weighted normal. Same
thing here. We can also add a weighted
normal modifier and that kind of fixes
some of the shading issues. Cool. So now
we kind of have this sort of stylized
thing. Maybe it can be a little bit
thicker. We can hold alt to select this.
Alt s and maybe like inflate it a little
bit. And book. I'm going to add a plane.
Let's just scale it down into an
arbitrary book shape. That looks pretty
good. Uh, you know, you can always
change it later, so it's not really a
big deal. Let's go into edit mode. E,
and extrude it upwards. Cool. Let's
apply our scale. Go into edit mode and
select these faces here. And I think I'm
going to shift duplicate them. I don't
know if we have to or if we could just
separate them, but I'm going to do it
anyway just in case. Then I'm going to P
separate by selection. So we kind of
have this cover here. That way we kind
of have a cover. And for the inner book
itself, I'm just going to scale that
down a little bit. Then let's select the
cover. Go into edit mode. Add a loop cut
here. And let's just do gy and move it
out kind of a little bit like that.
Let's add a subdivision surface modifier
of two. Again, that's control 2. You can
see it's right there. Let's go into edit
mode, add two bracing edge loops here,
and just scale it up on the S and X axis
kind of like so. And then let's add
another edge loop right here. And let's
add one on the bottom as well. And let's
just hold shift and alt to select both
of them. Just like this. Gy. Bring it
kind of really close to edge. Kind of
just like that. Let's add a solidify
modifier. We want to solidify before the
subdivision modifier. So let's do like
that. Right click. Let's do shade
smooth. Let's just increase the
thickness. So like so. Cool. Looking
good so far. Let's go into edit mode and
let's add a bracing edge loop here. And
another one right here. Shift alt.
Select both of those just like that.
Right? And then let's just do gy and
just brace that little curve there. So
how much curve you want, you can
determine that yourself. Let's move this
book just to kind of fill in that gap a
little bit there. And for this one,
instead of subdivision surface, what we
can do is just give it a bevel modifier.
So let's come over here, select this,
ctr L, copy modifiers like so. Shade
auto smooth. Cool. Looking good. Uh, and
then maybe we just increase the amount
of segments there. And then of course we
can increase the thickness kind of like
that. Uh, and then let's make sure to
check on even thickness just so we get a
little bit more bulky there. But again,
it's kind of up to your style and
everything. So there we kind of have our
stylized book. I might want to change
make modifications later. So I'm going
to shift duplicate move to a new
collection called modifiers.
And I'm just going to And then I'm also
going to create another collection
within that collection called book
modifiers like so. This way. And I'm
going to click and drag and put in the
modifiers. This way. If I want to make
changes to this book later, I can have a
backup here. But for these, I'm just
going to F3 convert to mesh. And then
I'm just going to join them right now.
Like so. Ctrl + J. We could have done
that for some of our other objects if we
wanted to come back to them. Um, but I
didn't do that. So, but for the book, I
definitely feel like I'm going to make
variations of this. So, that's why I
kind of wanted to keep that.
Additionally, for these other ones, they
still have their modifiers on there cuz
we're going to be revisiting them in a
little bit. A small little basket thing.
So, I'm going to create a plane
somewhere. Just scale it up in like a
basket shape. Well, I guess baskets have
multiple shapes, but anyway, same thing.
Eextrude up. Let's delete this face.
Let's give it a solidify modifier. Uh,
let's just turn up the thickness a
little bit. Let's turn even thickness.
Let's also apply our scale just to make
sure. Whoops. Wow. Now that's definitely
messed up. Doesn't really matter though.
Then let's add a subdivision surface
modifier again. Uh again, we could just
hit control 2. There. I think I'm going
to give it two here. Then we'll do shade
smooth. Now it Now it looks pretty good
like a basket. I think I want to add
like a guard loop down here. Now it kind
of looks like a trash can. So what I'm
going to do is probably add two loop
cuts. Whoops. Add two loop cuts. And
then just sx and scale it up there. So a
little bit of a guard edge there. And
then probably two over here. S y kind of
like that. So that's kind of looking a
little bit more like a basket now. Now
let's just increase our thickness just a
little bit. Um like so. Let's apply our
solidify modifier so we have more
geometry to work with. And I don't like
how the top is so round. So I'm going to
add another bracing edge loop there and
kind of just pull it outward. And then
maybe one in the center, too. Um, maybe
that's too much. I think just one to
pull out the enter is good. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's add a loop cut
here. And this way, I'll just make the
thing a little bit more round. Now, we
can go into wireframe. Let's just select
these top vertices here and let's turn
on proportional editing. Hit S and do X
and just make it a little bit round like
that. Cool. Let's go into solid view.
That doesn't look terrible. We can pull
these in if you want to make the inside
a little bit thinner. Or what we can do
instead is select these faces here.
Shift controll just like that. And then
alt s and whoops. Let's turn off
proportion editing. Alt s and kind of
just inflate the sides a little bit. Uh,
cool. So we kind of like a little bit
basket there. So let's come here and
select the bottom. You can select one
face, hold control shift and select the
diagonal of another face. And I'll
select everything in between. And if you
want, you can hit I to inset it just to
make it a little bit flatter there. And
then G and Z and bring it down. This
essentially adds another loop cut that
way. Or you can just leave it inset. I
think I'm just going to pull this one
down, this edge loop down just a little
bit. Maybe make it a little bit smaller.
Um, actually, no. I think I'm going to
make this a little bit smaller so it's
kind of braced a little bit. Cool. That
looks like a good basket. And then if
you want to add some detail, we can add
like two loop cuts here. Maybe SZ bring
them down kind of like something over
here. Uh maybe one over here. Cool.
Let's select this loop cut. Let's do Alt
E extrude along normals and kind of
bring it up just a little bit like so.
Cool. Then I don't like how it's like
subdividing here. So what we can do is
go into wireframe and select these
control loops like so. And over here in
item, there's this thing called mean
crease. And when you increase the mean
crease, you can see it's going to get
rid of that for us. And now it's just
going to leave something like that.
Additionally, if you don't want to use
that method and want more freedom, you
can just add another control loop. And
here, and kind of just pinch it up like
that. That way, you have a little bit
more flexibility and you still have some
sort of blend. Or or you can just adjust
the mean crease here a little bit, which
is what I'm going to be doing. So, I'm
just going to bring it up to maybe like
Yeah. So, I'm just going to bring it up
to a one actually cuz I kind of want it
completely distinct. Um, and then maybe
I want one more up here. SC, I'm just
going to eyeball it. We could have made
them identical in size, but honestly, it
doesn't really matter. Um, cool. Let's
do the same thing again. Alt E extrude
long normals. Hold alt to select the
loop. Go into edge select. Hold alt to
select the loop. Alt to select the loop.
And just increase the increase to all
the way to one. Just like that. And then
we kind of have something like that.
Scale that down. S. Again, you can
always change the size of stuff if you
want to. Uh, let's select these faces
here. Um, inside I I kind of just want
to inflate the inside a little bit. So,
I'm going to select these. Alt S kind.
And I think if it's too round inside,
you can add a bracing edge loop on the
inside as well. Um, I don't think I need
that, so I'm just going to leave it as
is. And now that I'm looking at it, this
looks a little too thin for the bulky
vibe we're going. So, I'm going to
select this edge loop, shift, alt, and
select this edge loop. Just bring it up
a little bit. Cool. That looks a little
bit better. Um, and maybe the top is
like too short now. So, we can just
increase that. Cool. Anyway, um, I don't
want to spend too much time on that. So,
now we can just create the handle. I'm
just going to use a Taurus for this
because, uh, we could use some other
method, but I'm just going to use a
Taurus. Again, we don't need Probably 24
is good enough for us. I'm just going to
24 is probably overkill too honestly,
but whatever. Let's go into edit mode.
Let's go into wireframe. Let's just
delete these vertices here. Cool. Let's
do RX90.
Hit minus just because I'm on the wrong
side. Let's just go somewhere over here.
Kind of like this. Um, actually, I want
the handle to come down a little bit.
So, I'm going to go into wireframe. Just
going to select these. Oops. Let's get
rid of those. GZ. And just bring it down
kind of like that. Cool. Add modifier.
Mirror modifier right here. Select this.
Let's do it in the Y direction. So from
far away, this might be an issue. So
let's just or actually close up. Let's
just make it a little bit smaller. Uh
maybe about the same size as the band
itself. So there we kind of have like a
small little basket thing. Cool. Okay.
Let's add another type of flower inside
here. So what I'm going to do is shift A
and probably just add a cube. Let's go
into edit mode. And whoops, I
accidentally Let's just extrude this up.
Uh, give it a subdivision surface
modifier. Cool. Let's go into local view
just to do this shade smooth. And, uh,
maybe like make that a little bit
smaller. Uh, and then for the sides, I'm
just going to duplicate this one. GY SY.
Kind of like that. And then I'm just
going to go into side view and probably
shape it up a little bit. So, definitely
one down here.
And oh, let's go into wireframe just to
make sure I select everything like the
ones behind
this one. I might make it down a little
bit. We probably need a guard loop on
both sides just to kind of make it just
so we can h have that inset there. Um,
cool.
So, yeah, you can definitely play around
with it if you want to. Maybe maybe we
can have like a bevel here.
And let's do S Y and just like push it
in a little bit so we get like a line
there. Cool.
Um, let's go into the other side view.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's add like
a loop cut here. Let's go into wireframe
and let's just like shape this kind of
like that. Actually, let's turn on
proportional editing here. Select these.
Let's just increase the sphere of
influence a little bit. Kind of make it
a little bit bendy. kind of like that. I
don't know if I want this to completely
wrap over, but uh it doesn't really
matter cuz you can always change that.
Cool. Now, let's just add a mirror
modifier. Let's select this over here.
Let's do it on the Y. Let's go up. Let's
duplicate it. Let's do R 90 like so.
Now, let's do it along the X and get rid
of the Y. And let's just move this over
here. All right. For the stem, you know
the deal. We're going to shift right
click somewhere where we want our stem
to start. So, maybe like here. We're
going to shift A at a single verticy,
not a curve, cuz we're going to create a
curve from this extruded single verticy.
So maybe let's just move this up a
little bit here. And we can rotate it. I
guess it doesn't really matter anyway.
Let's convert this to a curve. Convert
to curve. Come over here. And then in
bevel, just increase the depth a little
bit. Cool. Just like that. Right click,
shade smooth. Now, I do know that I want
to revisit this a little bit later. Oh,
looks like it's offcentered. So, let's
go into wireframe here and center that.
I do want to revisit this flower later
and make variations of it. So, I'm going
to do right now I'm going to shift
duplicate this and move it into a new
collection called flower v1 modifiers.
Modifiers.
And I'm just going to click and drag
this into our modifiers collection like
we did for the book. And since we
already made a collection for it, we
might as well make a collection for this
called flower v1. And this is the one
without modifiers. So now let's do F3
convert this to mesh. Let's also convert
these to mesh. So F3 convert to mesh.
And let's join it with the bottom here
because the origin point starts there.
And that's kind of exactly why I wanted
to start there instead of from the top.
So now when we scale, it's like that.
Cool. Let's place it in here. Shift S,
selection to cursor. Scale it down a
little bit. Cool. Scale it up maybe.
Shift Duplicate. RZ. Shift D. One more
time. Cool. Maybe something like that.
Cool. Now we kind of have like a small
little flower basket, which is really,
really cute. All right, let's create
like a billboard thing that you can like
put shelf stuff on. So, what I'm going
to do is shift right click or add a
plane. This is actually the same way we
did this. So, just a refresher, I guess.
R Y. You can skip ahead if you don't
want to watch this again. Let's then go
into edit mode, subdivide, subdivide,
subdivide. Cool. Let's select the center
right here, right click, loop tools, go
into circle, then add a guard loop a
little bit like that. Then delete those
faces. Let's add a solidify modifier
like so. Gy, sorry, gx. Move that up.
Turn on even thickness. Not that I think
it changes anything here, but I don't
think it does. Right click, shade auto
smooth. Cool. Sweet. Let's uh go and
apply our solidify modifier. Right now,
let's select this edge loop here and
just delete those faces. Let's add two
array modifiers, one and two. This one
is going to be zero, and then this one's
going to be one. That way, we can have
like a grid system. So, I don't know.
Maybe I'm going to go for something uh
four this way and then maybe four this
way. Cool. I don't know. Whatever you
want. Maybe five in this way. So, it's
kind of just a little bit longer. But
again, that's kind of really up to you.
Cool. Sx. Maybe bring that up a little
bit. GX.
Cool. Circles might be a little bit too
big. Let me see. Let's just select this
loop. Alt S. Um I guess that's okay.
Actually, it's not that big a deal. All
right, let's copy over one of our bevel
modifiers. So, I'll just do this one
again. Copy to selected. Cool. And I
think I want to make modifications to
this. So, I'm going to move it to a new
collection call.
I don't know what they call this.
Modifiers. I don't know what they call
that. So, I'm just going to create that
new collection. And um billboard
modifiers is going to go in there. All
right. So, now let's hit merge on all
our array modifiers. So, the overlapping
vertices like here and here would be
merged. And then let's just apply that.
Let's apply this one. Uh, and now what
we can do is go into edit mode. Select
this edge loop here. Select this edge
loop here. Select this edge loop. Edge
loop here. This one. This one is and
down here. And down here. Whoops. And
down here. Control E. Bridge edge loops.
Cool. Just like that. Uh, so honestly,
maybe instead of beveling this one, we
can give it like a subdivision. So,
let's just try that.
Yeah, I guess if you want like this,
this would be cooler for um I think it
looks better with a subdivision surface
than a bevel. Um but honestly, no one
can tell. And subdivision surface will
add a lot of geometry. So I feel like
we'll just stick with bevel. Uh so bevel
will be okay for this. Go for these ones
down here. So I'm going to hit uh alt
shift alt. Select this one as well.
Shift duplicate right click cancel. P
separated by selection. Cool. And now we
can just sx scale it up a little bit.
Um, looks like it's going that way for
some reason. So, we can just do sx minus
one. Cool. Let's select this loop here
and hit fill to fill that. Same thing
here. Let's over here and fill that. And
let's apply our scale to make sure
that's okay. And the bevel is way too
strong. So, let's just um decrease that
just a little bit there. Honestly, I
don't even know if we want a bevel on
this one, but either way, it's fine. Uh,
so yeah, there we kind of have that.
Shift, right click, add a plane. Let's
scale it down. SY gy. Just place it
right on top of one of these. Go into
edit mode. E extrude upwards. Kind of
like so. Let's copy over the bevel
modifier. Copy modifiers. Cool. Apply
our scale. Make sure everything's
working. Shade auto smooth. Syx.
Let's go into wireframe. Just layer it
on right on top of there. kind of just
and then this one can also have a
weighted normal just to fix some of the
shading issues. All right, let's fill up
these two. So, what I'm going to do is
select this, go select, control L, shift
D, duplicate, GZ, move it over here.
Let's turn on snapping. Okay, so I have
vertex snapping already. GZ, just snap
it to a vertex. Kind of like that. So,
let's do the same thing again. Ctrl L.
Let's do shift D, uh, Gy, and just snap
it over here somewhere. gy and then snap
it in the center. Same thing here. Okay,
let's shift D duplicate GZ gy S Y. Scale
it down. G Y. Kind of just like that.
Let's create like a hook for one of
these last ones. So, I'm going to go
into edit mode on this. Let's just
select where we want to start. Probably
here. Shift S cursor to selected.
Whoops. That'll just center it right
there. Let's add a single verticy.
Single vert like so. Remember, make sure
you are in vertex select. Let's go to
side view. Let's go into wireframe.
Let's just hit E to extrude it out and
lock it on the X- axis. E on the Z-axis
and then E on the X- axis again. Kind of
just like that. Then let's go into edit
mode. Let's select these two vertices.
Hit Ctrl +B for bevel. V to add some
faces. Sorry, some more vertices. I'm
going to use my middle mouse button. I
think I just need one. So, I'm just
going to go for one bevel. And maybe
something like this for the hook. Cool.
Then we can just F3 convert to a curve.
Same thing like we did for the stem.
Let's come down to bevel and just
increase the depth a little bit. And
actually, what we want to do is make it
the size of the hole. So, let's just
increase that. We can eyeball it. We
don't have to snap it or do anything. As
long as it looks good enough. If you
want, you can still edit your curve.
This looks This is definitely way too
far out there. Um, maybe this is out a
little bit too much. Uh, I don't know.
All right, let's go into school. That
looks nice. Let's shade smooth just to
make sure. Okay, maybe we increase the
resolution just a little bit. Okay,
that's fine. Now we can just F3, convert
to mesh. Let's go into edit mode. Let's
select this edge loop and hit fill.
Well, actually shade auto smooth this
time. Now, I'm definitely seeing some
issues here and here. Now, that might
not be an issue. We could probably fix
it with some rotation and some movement.
Or what we can do is control B and kind
of just like smooth it out a little bit.
It's not a perfect solution fix because
of the angle and the things like that,
but it's definitely not noticeable
anymore. Um, so that's totally fine. Uh,
it definitely looks a little bit
deflated here. You could edit that if
you want. I'm not going to bother doing
that. Anyway, let's just copy our bevel
modifier to this. So, I'm just going to
copy my modifier so it kind of looks a
little bit similar to this one right
here. Cool. Let's apply our scale just
to make sure everything is fine. Okay.
So, I actually I don't know, maybe I
want to align it with with uh this hole
here. Not that that makes sense. Um,
just because I don't want it to take up
everything. Uh, yeah. So, our picture
frame honestly is just going to be our
computer. So, I'm just going to
duplicate that. Shift S. selection to
cursor. Scale it down. GZ. Bring it up.
SC kind of like so. That's pretty cool.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's bring
this down kind of like here. And GZ and
uh over here. Over here. SC there. Cool.
There's kind of like our picture frame.
Now, for this one, I also did add five
segments. Adjusted them out. And in
geometry, I used arc. And in shading, I
did harden normals, which I mentioned a
little bit earlier in the video when I
teleported from the future. And I'm just
going to alt S and scale that in kind of
a little bit. Like so. S Y. Cool. And
then let's go into edit mode. Just
select these faces and do GX. Move it
out a little bit. Kind of like that. GY.
GX. Bevel is definitely a little bit too
strong here. So, I'm definitely going to
reduce that a little bit. Kind of like
so. All right. Let's go into edit mode.
Let's go into this back view and let's
create a picture frame stand. So, I
actually I'm just kind of going off of
memory here. I don't know what they look
like. R Y 90. Maybe something like this.
And then they rotate a little bit. Go
into edit mode. Eextrude this out. E
extrude this out. Y. Nope. GXX. Okay.
It's going to be like this. Scale this
down a little bit. Um, and then I think
it's going to be resting on one of these
sides. Actually, let's just merge this
by at center. Um, and then I think it's
going to be resting kind of like this.
So, we can scale this down.
like so.
Cool. And then our y
gy gx. Let's add a solidify modifier.
Let's just rotate this a little bit and
have it rest. I think that doesn't
really make sense logically. So, I'm
just going to move this up right here.
Uh I don't actually know what the back
of a picture frame looks like. And
having a fold actually might be a little
bit more realistic. I'm not going to
bother adding a bevel modifier to this
just because no one's going to be paying
that close attention to it, if at all.
It just kind of needs to be there. So, I
don't want to add all that extra
geometry and information for no reason.
All right, so let's make a slipper. I'm
just going to add a plane. Scale it down
in like a slipper shape. Um, then I'm
just going to extrude. All right, let's
create a slipper. I'm just going to
probably add a plane again and then just
scale it in arbitrary shape of a
slipper. Cool. Let's add a subdivision
surface modifier.
Cute. Let's add two control loops. Um,
and
I guess I kind of like it like that.
Maybe scale it down a little bit. Maybe
move this one down in the Y and kind of
like scale that down. Maybe the back can
be a little bit smaller. We're not going
for a realized scale one. We're kind of
going for a cute one. So, let's add a
solidify modifier here. Um, let's go. We
want to solidify it before we subdivide
it. Let's increase some thickness a
little bit. Cool. So, we got some
chunkiness there. Um, let's do even
thickness. And let's kick shade smooth.
Cool. There's like the base of our
slipper. All right. Let's go into local
view and let's just add a plane. So, I'm
just going to shift a add a plane. Uh,
and I'm just going to scale that down
until I get a shape that I want to
cover. So, probably something like here.
Gy GX. That looks pretty good. Let's add
a loop cut down the center. Let's select
that loop cut and let's go into
wireframe actually and just bring that
up. Honestly, it doesn't have to be
perfectly straight up primarily because
slippers in real life, their holders are
never perfect. Having some distortion
actually wouldn't be bad at all. But
anyway, I'm just going to control B and
scroll up on my mouse wheel uh for some
more vertices until they're about even
in length along the curve. So, I think
that's going to be more than enough. So,
that says eight there, which means it's
probably 10 in total. And I'm not using
a mirror modifier this time because I
don't want them to be symmetrical. And
I'm just going to select the middle one,
turn on proportional editing, and kind
of just uh bring it up until I get
something round. And then let's bring
out some of these. So this can be a
little bit round. This one can be a
little bit round as well. Cool. Like so.
Might take a little bit of work, a
little bit of effort, but that's totally
okay. Um, and let's Okay, that's okay.
Let's maybe have to rotate some of them.
That's cool. Cool. Then we can just
bring it down like so. Let's go into
solid view. Um, let's add a we can just
do control 2 for subdivision surface
modifier. Add two control loops. S Y
Whoops. Let's turn off proportion.
Adding S Y. Move it out a little bit.
And luckily, since it's inside, we don't
actually need control loops down here to
flatten out the bottom because it's
inside anyway. So, we just need these.
And honestly, maybe leaving this curved
two is fine. Let's just apply scale
shade smooth. Maybe one is okay. Yeah,
one is actually more than enough for
this. I wonder if one is here is fine as
well. No. Okay, this one definitely
needs two. Cool. Let's add a solidify
modifier here. Let's do it before the
subdivision. Even thickness and just
bring it up a little bit. Kind of like
that. Uh so there we kind of have our
slipper gy. All right, let's adjust our
slipper a little bit more. I think maybe
just scale this down a tad bit.
Um, and then let's just align this a
little bit better. Cool. Yeah, doesn't
have to be perfect. So, I'm just going
to G, shift D, move it under over here.
And then, of course, we need two. So,
let's shift DG. And then, let's move it
somewhere over here at a different
rotation.
All right, let's just add some boxes
here. Uh, again, just a plane. Scale it
down. Let's get in box shape. You know
the drill. Extrude. Go here. This one
I'm just going to P separate by
selection because it'll cover the top.
Let's just do object set origin. Origin
to geometry. Scale that up. Go into edit
mode. AE extruded upwards. Cool. Scale
it down slightly. Select both of these.
Come over here. Come over here and copy
to selected. Apply our scale. Make sure
that's good. Cool. Let's select these.
Let's adjust the amount a little bit.
Again, I'm holding alt so it affects
both of them at the same time. And we
don't need that many segments. So four
should be okay. Kind of like so. All
right. Now, let's add a small little
sign detail here. I don't honestly, it's
like a label or something. So, R Y 90.
Scale it down. Cool. S Y like so. Go
into edit mode. E extrude it out just a
little bit. Let's add a loop cut down
here and extrude this. And this can be
like a symbol statement or something.
So, it's like a box with some info. I'm
not going to give this bevel modifier
just because it's so far away. All
right. Let's add like a small hanging
plant here. So, it kind of fills up this
empty space. So, what I'm going to do is
shift right click and what I'm going to
do is shift A and add for a single
verticy like we did for all the other
curves. Let's go into side view here.
Again, make sure you're in vertex
select. Let's go into wireframe. And I'm
just going to extrude downwards like a
wire sort of thing. Uh, sorry, I mean
like a rope. We can turn our
proportional editing. I don't know why I
have that on. Generally, uh, you can use
physics simulations to wrap your rope a
little bit better around it and a lot
more realistic. I'm just doing it this
way. So, Ctrl + B and V just to bevel
this area right here. Probably Ctrl + B
and V to bevel up here as well. The
reason I'm just doing it this way is
because it's faster. Um, it might be
less realistic, but it's definitely
faster. So, I don't want it too far down
actually. Maybe just like so. Here is
like Okay, cool. Um, so it'll definitely
be less realistic, but that's totally
okay. Let's convert to curve. Let's uh
increase the the depth. Let's increase
the resolution here. Uh, right click,
shade smooth. Let's add a subdivision
surface modifier with control 2. And you
can see we kind of already have
something just like that. If you need to
adjust your curve, you can totally do
that. Uh, if you want to. Maybe I want
to um, you know, I think that's okay.
So, I'm just going to leave it like
that. All right. Let's add a flower pot
over here. So, what I'm going to do is
just add a cylinder. 16 vertices is
okay. Let's go into edit mode. Let's
just add a loop cut here. I don't know.
I think that's okay. Hold Alt to select
that full loop. Alt E extrude along
normals. Bring that up. Uh maybe this
side. This we can expand it a little
bit. S. Shift Z just to make it a tad
bit wider. Cool. That's kind of cool.
Then this here. Let's insert a little
bit and just extrude downwards. Right
click shade auto smooth. Let's copy over
one of these bevel modifiers. Copy.
Seven is definitely going to be too much
for this pot. So we can lower that. And
we can also lower them out as well. I
don't want it too bulky. Cool. There's
like our flower pot. Uh I don't like how
the bottom is so wide, so I'm just going
to angle that a little bit. And let's
just move it kind of like that. Cool.
Let's just scale it down.
Um place it over here. Let's just make
sure this is uh you know, this is like
kind of looks like it's wrapping sort of
thing. And then maybe we can actually
just put these on the side here. Um,
that way it kind of looks like it's uh
connected to the bucket. If you want,
you can add details here to make it more
seamless, but I'm not going to bother
doing that plant thing. So, what I'm
going to do is go into top view. Let's
add a plane. Let's go into local view
for this. And I'm just going to shape.
Let's add a loop cut here. And I'm just
going to shape my thing to kind of look
like a leaf. So, maybe let's E and
extrude Y and scale that down.
And Gy and bring this down. Maybe add a
loop cut in the center here. Let's maybe
extrude one more time.
Gy. And let's make this a lot thinner.
So we kind of have like a
something like this. That kind of looks
like a shape of a leaf, right? So now
what we can do is add a subdivision
surface modifier. One might be okay. One
is okay, I think. Anyway, let's go in
here. Let's just extrude upwards. All
right. So there's our leaf. Right click.
Shade smooth. And I want some detail in
the center. So I'm going to go into edit
mode and probably add like two loop
cuts. One on this side and bring that
in. And then one on Whoops. One on this
side as well. Then one on this side and
bring it in. And then with this middle
one selected, hold control and probably
just GZ and move that in a little bit.
Yeah. And I guess if we want to, we can
select these faces and just SX and move
them a little bit closer just for a
little bit more pinching here, you know.
Anyway, let's create like a stem thing.
I don't know what they call it. So,
possibly here. Oh, actually, let's
include these and just see what it gives
us. Ey.
Cool. So, that looks nice. Let's add two
supporting loops here. S Y and kind of
just pull it out. Sorry. along with the
plant, we can have like a small bud, you
know, like the things before they
blossom or seeds or whatever they call
that. So to do that one, I think what we
can do is a plane again. Let's go into
edit mode. Let's just extrude it up and
add a subdivision surface modifier. And
let's just scale this down a little bit
so it's kind of like a bud shade smooth.
Cool. Let's bring this down. GZ.
Now it kind of looks like an egg, but we
can bring down something like this.
Cool. We can go into edit mode. We can
insert this face here and probably
extrude down. Let's add some control
loops here
and here. That might be a little bit too
far down. So, we can just select this
and bring this up a little bit. Okay.
Now, since we're going to make multiple
of these, what we have to do now is
delete these faces right now. Uh that
way we'll save because we'll never see
them. We want to delete those. Now, the
other models, I didn't preemptively
delete some of them primarily because I
was thinking of revisiting that later
and they were kind of easy to fix later.
However, for this, we definitely want to
delete it in advance because we know
we'll never see that and it'll just take
up space. Anyway, let's come over here
and I'm just going to add a cylinder.
Now, 16 vertices is okay. Let's do RX
90. And let's just scale it down and Sy
and kind of just scale it up and scale
it down again. and shift shade auto
smooth. And now what we can do is just
shift duplicate this and kind of go like
so. Shifty duplicate. Let's put over
there. I kind of want it to taper off,
which means the top has a much smaller
leaf. So what we can do is just
duplicate this. Duplicate.
Um, and then I want to end on a leaf. So
let's just make it smaller. We can
change the rotation a little bit. Like
so. All right. So yeah, I just
duplicated a bunch of times and rotated
a few of them on each side. And now what
we want to do is add a bunch of loop
cuts here. So honestly, I don't really
know how many I'm doing. I feel like
that'll be enough. You can always add
more later. And now let's turn on
proportional editing with O. Let's kind
of just select the top. Well, let's go
into wireframe. Make sure I select the
back ones, too. And kind of just like
thin it down a little bit. Uh so the top
I definitely want it to be smaller than
the other one. So let's just change the
sphere of influence here. Um, I don't
know if I want to merge it because then
there'll be like a point and that'll be
like too unrealistic. But something like
this. Uh, so it's like a little bit
thicker and then it thins out at the
end. Cool, cool, cool. Maybe we can make
this back thicker a little bit. Just
kind of not too big, but just slightly
thicker. Cool. So once your plant is
done, uh, wh I guess we have to readjust
these now.
OB, of course, we got to adjust these.
Let's make sure everything is inside.
Make sure go to side view and everything
is inside as well. All right. So, when
you have a plant that you're happy with,
uh, let's just select all this, shift
duplicate, GX, and move this into a new
collection. And I'll call this hanging
plant. Hanging plant, and then
modifiers.
Uh, I think I had underscore. So, I'm
just going to use the same navigation.
I'm just going to click and drag this
into our modifier collection. Right. So,
then select these and let's move this to
a new collection. hanging plant create.
Cool. And we can just delete these
because we don't need them anymore.
Okay. So, make sure your everything is
looking good. So, let me just check. Uh
yeah. So, let's join these. And it seems
like they have different levels of
subdivision surface. So, we have to
apply these first. I'm actually going to
select all of these. I'm actually going
to select all of these because I don't
think they have to be on level two. I'm
going to hit alt, hold alt, and just
click this. And now you can see all of
them will only have a level up one. So
these all have a level one. Now we can
just hit A to select everything. F3,
convert to mesh. This will apply all the
modifiers on all the leaves. And now we
can just select everything and hold
shift to select this as our active
object. Ctrl + J. And now we just have a
plant here. Okay. So now what we want to
do is like bend it a little bit to make
it a little more variety because real
life plants are really straight like
this, right? So what you could do is go
into wireframe and turn on proportional
editing. go into edit mode and honestly
just like start moving stuff around with
like proportional editing. And honestly,
this is like an approach that is fairly
fairly common. Or the other thing if you
wanted to do a little more procedurally
is to add a modifier. And this one is
called a simple deform modifier. And
right now it's really really messed up.
So maybe let's apply our scale. And it's
a little bit better here. And you can
see that you can change the angle and
it'll kind of like deform it, right?
It's like doing the work for you. You
can try and play around with these other
axes as well and some of these other
formats like bend. So bend is kind of
doing that kind of cool thing. And then
if you want you can add another simple
deform modifier on top. So one of them
is twisting whereas another one is
bending them. Super super cool. Right.
And then you can play with some of these
other ones like taper which kind of
already adds a taper for us on our
object. Right? You can see that it's
kind of tapering. It's making the bottom
bigger than the top. So it kind of saves
out on what we did already. And then you
also have something like stretch and
things like that. And then and then
yeah, you have more complicated options
here, but uh we're not going to be
getting into that. So here, you know, we
have something a little bit deformed
kind of like that. And of course, if you
want to combine it, you can move it
yourself, right? And combine it with the
modifiers. You know, no real right or
wrong. So there, I kind of just moved it
like that. So that was really cool. Um
but, you know, really, really up to you.
Use modifiers. Don't use modifiers. Not
really a big deal. All right. The next
thing we would do is since it's going to
be hanging, it would be a lot easier if
we could just like move one thing and
have this move along with it. Right. So,
we can actually do that with a curve
modifier. So, if I do shift S, cursor 2
selected, and just search for a curve.
So, we can add a path curve here. And if
I go into edit mode, you can see it's
kind of like this. So, let's turn off
proportional editing and let's just
rotate the curve 90° kind of like this.
Let's go into wireframe. Go into edit
mode. Select everything and just S Y.
Well, let's turn off proportional
editing and just scale it up kind of
like this, right? Doesn't have to be
accurate. And you can always add more if
you want. Then for the branch or sorry,
yeah, the branch, add a modifier. And
this time we're going to go for a deform
curve modifier. You can see it's in the
deform menu. And then the curve object
we want is going to be this path that we
just created here. And now what you can
see is when I edit this curve, it's
going to deform across my object. Right?
So it's going to actually deform my
object along that curve, which is
really, really cool. Right? So the
reason it's not working properly right
now is probably because of the origin
point. But that's fine because what you
can do is just select the curve and then
just move the curve up until it aligns
with your object. And if you need, you
can go into edit mode and just extrude
out another one and uh adjust the points
accordingly. Go back into object mode
and adjust it accordingly. So now you
can see we have this curve thing here
that kind of deforms our thing for us.
And this way we don't have to do like
proportional editing or any of that
stuff. We can just adjust the curve. So
what we can do to reset everything is
select everything, go SZ0 just to
flatten it out. Go into top view and
then move everything slightly close to
each other in a straight line. doesn't
have to be accurate. And then we can
select everything sx0 and it'll strain
out. So now we have this sort of thing
that we can use anywhere. So let's go
make sure everything is selected. Let's
enter exit local view. Let's go back.
Just scale this down. Um move it over
here. Shift S. Selection to cursor. Keep
offset. Kind of just move it somewhere
over here like RR. Let's just rotate it
somewhere arbitrarily. Let's just place
it in our plot like here. All right. So,
what we can do now, if you can't see
your curve, that's fine. We called it,
we added a nerves path. I never did in
the file. So, we can just search for
nerves path. You can see it's right
here. Let's also move that to the
hanging plant collection. So, I just hit
M and then I'm just going to move it in
there. And now it's selected. You can
hit period on your numpad key just to
jump to your selection and it'll show
you in the outliner. I'm sure there's a
way to do it without a numpad, but I'm
not familiar with it. Either way, we're
here now and it's inside hanging plane.
So, that's nice. Now we can just go in
edit mode and adjust our plant right
like so. So here we can just adjust our
plant um and uh you know make it hanging
off off off the the thing here. Of
course if you want you can use
proportional editing. Uh so you can turn
on proportional editing and kind of
affect you know the sphere of influence
of your stretch and things like that.
And if you want to duplicate this make
sure you select the path and your object
and shift duplicate it that way. If you
want to, you can go into edit mode and
still adjust your curve. You can turn
off some of these in edit mode so it's
easier to edit and go into local view
and you can still like scale it
downwards or like extrude this outwards
if you need to. Ctrl L duplicate this if
you want. So you can still adjust it in
here if you want to. Or when you're
happy with it, you can just apply
everything. Same with this as well. Just
apply everything.
Then you can just delete your path
curves. And now since they're deformed,
you can still now use your proportional
editing just to kind of like tidy it up
and stuff like that. Uh, and then for
this flower here, I literally just
duplicated the flower we made earlier,
and then I selected each face of this,
Ctrl L, and then just did Alt S just to
inflate it a little bit, holding shift
just to make it a little bit like that.
So I just I literally just use this.
Actually, let's just delete our keyboard
reference image right now. Okay, let's
create a piano. I'm just going to shift
right click, add a cube. Let's scale it
down kind of like so in a piano shape.
Then let's just add two loop cuts for
the edges. So two right here. Um and
then let's G move it out. Let's add one
for the back. Let's just select these
two fa these faces and just extrude up
just like that. S Y a little bit. Yeah.
Cool. Cool. That's looking good. Let's
apply our scale. Let's add a bevel
modifier. So I'm just going to copy from
here. Whoops. Ctrl L. Copy modifiers
just like so. Um, and let's change this
to arc just to finish the corners up a
little bit. Looks good. Let's harden
normals is on. Great. Right click,
shade, auto smooth. Cool. Looking like a
nice piano. May I don't know if the
bottom needs to be a little bit thicker.
Maybe it does. So, control shift. Get
the two corners like we did earlier.
Maybe just move that out a little bit.
Um, maybe move this up a little bit.
Yeah, cool. Cool. That's what we got.
Now, what we can do is add a loop cut.
Maybe about this size here. Let's just
select this. Shift Duplicate, right
click, cancel. P separate by selection.
Let's select this edge loop here. Ctrl +
X to dissolve that.
Now, let's select this one. Let's go
into edit mode. Hit A and E and extrude
it upwards. Let's add let's add object
set origin origin to geometry just to
reset that a little bit. And the bevel
is way too strong on this one. So, let's
turn down the amount of segments. And
let's definitely turn up about the
amount. I think this also has way too
many segments. I think seven is a little
overkill. And amount's a little
overkill, too. So, let's fix that. All
right, let's just do sy. Scale it in
just a little bit. So, there's like a
little bit of a gap. Cool. Now, what we
can do is add an array modifier. I think
that spacing actually looks pretty good
uh because of the bevel modifier, but we
can increase it a little bit if we want
to. I don't know. That's I guess that's
okay. Cool. And then let's just increase
that until we fill it up.
Uh probably somewhere over here seems
about right. And having that little bit
gap, we can go and scale it up if you
want, but maybe having that little gap,
I think, is perfectly acceptable.
All right. So, for the black piano keys,
we can just shift duplicate this. Um
let's just bring it up here. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's uh uh let's
actually just hide this in edit mode for
this one. Let's hide this in edit mode.
Go into edit mode. Ctrl L. Let's just
scale this down a little bit. Um, move
it right here
about so. And let's shift duplicate it
and have one over here. Let's lock it on
the X- axis. And also put it in the
center somewhere.
So, this should also be a little bit
centered. I'm kind of just looking at
the center here. It doesn't have to be
perfect. Cool. And then we probably have
to change the array offset. So, let me
just temporarily set this to zero. And
let's just shift Duplicate this. Skip a
key in between like so. So, we have two
white keys in between. And then this
one, let's just control shift ctr L
shift D GX. Move it in the center as
well. We don't have to snap it or be
perfect or anything. It's totally fine.
Okay. Now, we can just add another one
here. So, let's come to array. Let's uh
just increase this factory. Again, we
want to skip one just like so. So,
that'll be centered there. And then this
one, let's add one more here. And let's
just drag it to the end. Well, it looks
like we're not going to be able to fit
that, which is totally okay because what
we can do, let's go into edit mode, go
uh go into wireframe, select this side,
and just git
a little bit. Um, so, well, actually, we
probably should have added one more key
just to see how it is. Cool. Uh, let's
just go back into edit mode, GX, and
kind of move it back. Just like that.
And then let's go into wireframe. Let's
just select this. Let's go into top
view. Let's box select this. Let's make
sure
um
I think I want the bevel actually.
That's fine. So, yeah, that that should
be okay for us. And here, let's make a
stand. So, I'm just going to shift right
click, add a cylinder. 16 might be
overkill because it's really small, but
you know, whatever. It doesn't really
matter. Let's do shade auto smooth.
Let's go into local view. Let's do RX90
just like so. Let's scale that up on the
Yaxis. Let's go into edit mode. Let's
add a loop cut here. Let's just delete
those back vertices right now. And then
let's give it a mirror modifier. Uh I
think it'll be Z-axis. Cool. Let's turn
on clipping so they don't go through
each other. Cool. Let's go into edit
mode. Let's add a loop cut here. Let's
select this with alt. Let's come up
here. Let's do select. Checker deselect.
Alt D. Extrude along normals. and just
hold shift and increase that just a
little bit so we have that support right
there. Let's go back out. Let's make it
there. I'm not going to give this a
bevel modifier because it's so small and
no one's going to notice about it. So
maybe I'll do SY just make it as small
as the piano itself. Well, the piano
seems to be going inside the room. And
let's deselect the room. Um like so. I
kind of want this to be slightly bigger
than the piano itself. And if you have
troubles with keep on always selecting
this, you can just come up here, enable
this thing. And then now if you click
it, you can't select this anymore. So
that really helps. Um, so we can just
box select, move it out a little bit,
move this. I kind of want it slightly
wider like so. So that looks pretty good
to me. Then what we can do is add
another mirror modifier. So let's search
for a mirror modifier. This time we want
to do it on the origin of this. So, make
sure this set origin origin to geometry.
It's in the center of that. So, it'll be
centered kind of like so. And then you
can move this on the X if you want it a
little bit wider. All right. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's add like a loop
cut maybe around this size here. And I
think we select these faces to extrude
them up. Let's go into side view. Let's
go into wireframe. And let's just E
extrude it upwards like so. And then we
want to crisscross them like so. S0.
Typically, there is like some sort of
support up top here, but I don't think
anyone's ever going to look down here.
So, I'm not going to bother wasting my
time for that. Uh, cool. So, like even
if someone looks down, they'll kind of
be like, ""Oh, that's still fine anyway.""
So, there we kind of have our support.
Okay. And I think I want to give the
beams a bevel modifier, but not this
bottom thing. So, what I'm going to do
is hold Alt just to select this entire
loop thing. So, let's make sure we get
the top faces as well. Cool. Let's just
P separate by selection. And then let's
come over here and copy our copy to
selected bevel modifier applier scale
scale. Make sure that works. Four
segments might be too much. Whoops, I'm
changing the wrong one. So, four
segments might be too much. Uh, three is
okay. And then we can just adjust amount
a little bit here. Uh, seems like the
stand seems like the stand is a little
bit too big compared to the piano. So,
what we can do is just select the piano
and deselect this. Just hit S to scale
it up like so. Cool. Then this might be
a little bit too close. So, we can just
do G GX together. Maybe. And now for
this thing here, we kind of have like
this gaping hole because that's where we
separated. We can fill that if we want
to, but we're going to be ending up
deleting that anyway. So, for the time
being, we can just do R Y and do like
180 and just like now the hidden face is
on the bottom instead. We'll we'll come
back and be deleting hidden faces
anyway. So, for now, we can just leave
that as a temporary fix. All right,
let's come up here and let's cut out a
window. So, arbitrarily shape the window
how you want it. Then, let's uh well, we
can't select that. So, let's look for
our maybe collection, which is right
here. And let's activate selection
again. Now we can select it. So if you
want, you can shift duplicate this and
move it into modifiers. Uh we probably
should have named it. Oh well, it
doesn't really matter. So let's apply
our solidify modifier once you get a
size that you like. Cool. Now let's add
a boolean modifier. So let's search for
boolean
and difference and select our cutout
object. Cool. And now let's just come
over here, visibility, and instead of
textured, let's just do wire. And now
let's just adjust our cutting out object
to get a shape that we want, a shape
that I like. And I'm actually going to
leave it square here. But if you want,
you can add you can go cut it out first
and then go for a boolean. But I'm going
to apply my bevel first and then apply
my boolean. And now I'm just going to
delete this. And everything looks good.
So for the window, the first thing I'm
going to do is probably shift Duplicate,
right click, cancel, p separate by
selection. And and then this piece right
here, let's right click, set origin
origin to geometry. It'll be kind of
like the start of our thing. So let's
apply our scale just to make sure that
works. Let's add a loop cut down the
center. And this first half will be our
first one, our first window, and the
second half will be the second. So let's
also select this and P separate by
selection. Uh disable selection for the
house so we don't keep selecting. Let's
select both them. Right click, set
origin origin to geometry. So now we
kind of have something like that. Let's
just scale this down on the Y gy. Let's
go into edit mode, A, and just extrude
that kind of like so. Let's go into edit
mode. Let's uh let's apply our scale
just to make sure. And then let's just
hit I to insert this. And then with both
of them still selected, let's delete
those faces. Now, let's do the same
thing for this one back here, except
this time it's going to be a little bit
up here, like so. Let's go into edit
mode. Hit a extrude everything. Cool.
Just like that. Let's select these two
faces. Hit I to insert.
You can make it as thick as you want or
just change it later. Delete faces. All
right. Now, let's go in both of them.
Let's shift alt and select this loop.
Shift alt select that loop. Shift alt
select this loop. Shift alt select this
loop. That's just like that. Then we'll
do Ctrl E bridge edge loops. And that'll
kind of fill in the frame for us. Let's
select this one and copy to selected.
And uh let's make sure to apply our
scale to make sure that's working.
Actually, the amount looks a little bit
too much. So, I'm just going to reduce
that a little bit. Cool. Yeah. And I'm
definitely going to inflate these a
little bit. So, I'm just going to hit
Alt S and make that a little bit
thicker. Just like that. Reactivate
selection on our cube. Let's select all
three of these. Go into edit mode. go
into wireframe and let's just select all
these and probably S shift Y and just
make it a little bit bigger.
But again, that's kind of all up to you
and what you want to do with your your
window and things like that. Maybe
center with piano. Cool. All right,
let's use the draw cube tool just to for
our I don't know what they call this at
the top, our window blinds. So, I'm just
going to add that there. And then let's
go back. Let's go into local view. Then,
let's just extrude upwards. Hold this.
Alt D. Oh, let's deselect this back one.
And then alt D. Extrude along normals. S
to scale evenly. Kind of just like so.
Then we kind of have a top there. Uh
maybe the top can be a little bit taller
than the other one. So I'm just going to
select that. Bring Let's copy a bevel
modifier over. Ctrl L. Copy modifiers.
Apply our scale. Make sure that works.
Seems like I don't have a bevel modifier
in this one. So let's just copy this
one.
Okay. For the window blinds, I'm just
going to select this face. Shift
Duplicate. Right click P. separate by
selection. Let's uh right click, set
origin origin to geometry. Let's just
scale this down arbitrarily. Uh
definitely in the Y. Actually, I don't
know if I wanted to do it in the X. So,
let's make that back up. Let's go into
edit mode. Let's just e extrude it
downwards a little bit. Let's apply our
rotation and location just in case. And
let's add a array modifier like so.
Let's come down here. Let's change this
to zero. And I'm guessing it's going to
be in the one. So, yeah, it will be. We
don't need that much of a bevel cuz it's
very not noticeable. So, let's reduce
the amount of segments. One is fine
enough. And let's just change this to
like four or something. We can have uh
one of those hanging things. So, I'm
just going to put it here. I'm going to
shift right click. And I'm going to have
a Taurus. And I'm going to make this
really like low poly. So, like 12. Well,
I'm going to click and drag both of them
and just set them at to 10 actually. So,
cuz it's so small. and do right click
shade auto smooth R Y90.
Okay, let's shift D duplicate that.
Bring that down. Let's do RZ90. Kind of
like so. Let's go into edit mode on this
one and just select the Well, let's make
sure we're in R frame. Let's just delete
those vertices there. And actually, now
we just bring both of these up. And then
let's just bring this down a little bit.
GZ. Cool. So, we kind of have like a
small little hook there from really
matter anyway. What we can do now is
just shift a add a cylinder.
And we probably only need like 10 here
as well. So I'm just going to scale that
down. Not going to give this a bevel
modifier or anything either. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's just select that
face right there. And let's just GZ
bring it down kind of like so. The
bottom. We can also have a small board.
So I'm just going to shift duplicate
this. Move this down here. Get rid of
the array modifier. And just move it in
alignment. Sx.
object set origin origin geometry sx a
little bit gx. Cool. It doesn't have to
be anything fancy here.
All right, let's create a microphone.
I'm just going to shift A and probably
add a cube. Add control 2 subdivision
service modifier. Scale it up a little
bit. Two guard loops per usual. S. Scale
them up kind of in a microphone shape.
That looks nice, smooth. Let's go into
edit mode. Let's create a holder. So, I
think I'm going to have a loop cut here.
Now let's select this loop here. Let's
do alt e extrude along normals kind of
like so.
That looks about right. Then let's
select these edge loops here. Like so.
Same thing we did for the basket. Uh
let's come over here and let's just
increase mean increase like so. Let's go
back. Let's select this edge loop again.
Let's hit Ctrl+ to increase our
selection. Let's just P separate by
selection. Kind of like that. So now
it's kind of somewhat like this. All
right. And then for the top, uh, maybe
we can shift D, duplicate, right click,
cancel, P, separate by selection. Then
we can extrude this up a little bit. And
let's add a guard loop down here. So it
kind of flattens out on the top. Let's
just use that to cover the top like so.
Then let's go into edit mode. Maybe add
two loop cuts here. SX, whoops, SY.
Sorry. Let's select these two. Shift
Duplicate. Right click, cancel piece
separate by selection. Then let's go
back into edit mode. Shift alt. Whoops.
shift out the loops that we created and
Ctrl X just to dissolve those. Now we
have this thing right here. Let's just
GX move it in place. Go into edit mode.
AE extrude outwards. Just like that. GZ
bring it down. And uh for this we can
add probably a control loop here.
Selected all those. And we can just GX
and move that in there. That might be a
little bit too in. So I'm going to add
another loop cut here. And just bring
this out like so. All right. And let's
just add a mirror modifier to this. And
uh let's select our object here. All
right, let's select our microphone and
just go into local view to create a
stand for it. So, doesn't really matter,
honestly. I think I'm just going to uh
select this bottom here. Shift
duplicate. Right click, cancel. P
separate by selection. And I'm just
going to bring it down somewhere
arbitrarily. Let's uh e extrude it
upwards. Two guard loops like so. We
could probably use like a cylinder,
honestly, but whatever. Uh, and then
let's go into top view just to make sure
it's it's about the same size as the
microphone or maybe a little bit bigger.
But again, that's kind of up to you.
Let's move it GY. Use a plane rather
than a subdivision thing just because it
won't be noticeable. So again, I'm just
going to add a plane here. Go into like
so. Go over here. S Y. Go into edit
mode. E extrude upwards. Maybe move it
back a little bit. And then I'm just
going to add a loop cut here like so.
And just extrude this. And let's go into
the side here and just move it kind of
like that. Let's go into wireframe and
adjust this. Um, if you want to add like
a cylinder here, just so it kind of has
a joint, working joint, you totally can.
Uh, I feel like no one's going to pay
attention to that, so I'm not even going
to I'm not going to bother looking for
it. I'm not going to bother adding it.
But depending on your project, you might
want to add that. Um, so this looks a
little bit too tall for my liking. And
then maybe we can copy a bevel modifier
just to this one just to see. Let's
apply our scale. Uh let's just reduce
the amount a little bit. Cool. So
that'll be it. Right click. Shade auto
smooth. Cool. Uh so this kind of looks a
little bit too wide. So I'm just going
to select everything. Sift Z. Shift Z.
And just scale it like that. If you want
to give it more of like a holder style,
you could totally add like two loop cuts
here. and then delete uh probably these
faces as well as these faces, X faces.
Then you could just like fill in all the
edges, but I'm not going to be doing
that um because no one's going to be
paying that close attention. All right,
let's add like a egg carpet. So, I'm
just going to shift A and add a plane
like so. Uh this was inspired by Nikki
Blender, which is a she's a really
popular uh 3D artist. You should totally
check her out. Um, but basically I'm
just making a random shape uh that's u
you know in like a egg splatter sort of
format. Doesn't honestly it really does
not matter what your shape is. Then just
add control 2 subdivision surface
modifier. Go into edit mode E extrude
upwards. Right click shade smooth. So
this is kind of like our carpet. Uh S
shift C. Let's just make it a little bit
bigger. Cool. Let's just uh select one
of these. Shift Duplicate. Right click
cancel. Puppy by selection. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's make it a little
bit like this. Sunnyside up egg. I think
that's what they call it. And uh this
will be like our carpet. And this might
be like a pillar or something. All
right. Let's uh add a lamp. So I'm just
going to probably add a plane here. Give
it a subdivision surface modifier. Let's
e extrude it upwards in like a I don't
know like a lamp shape. And let's just
alt s extrude. Maybe add control loop
here. Bring that in a little bit. Right
click shade smooth. That kind of looks
like an okay lamp. Um, maybe we can
bring this down a little bit. Let's add
a guard loop over here. Down on the
bottom here. Maybe one more over here.
Cool. And then let's just scale this
down and bring that up. Cool. Then we
can add like a control loop over here.
Like so. Shift alt shift alt sift z.
Bring it a little bit like that. Now for
the top, we can just add a cylinder. So
let's just add a cylinder. 12 should be
okay. Let's scale it down. Go into edit
mode. Let's select both of these and
just delete those faces. Let's select
this. Alt extrude along normals like so.
Let's select this edge loop and then
just scale it down like so. Let's go
over here. Just scale it upwards kind of
like so. Cool. And maybe maybe I want
like a like a bulkier kind of lamp.
Something like that. That looks kind of
cute. Right click shade auto smooth.
Yeah, I don't think it's worth adding a
light bulb in there. And I don't think
it's worth adding a bevel or subdivision
to this either cuz it's so small. All
right, let's add a shelf. Shift DG,
shift Y. Let's move it somewhere here.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's just
bring that out on the Y-axis a little
bit. Cool. Let's just shift Duplicate.
Right click, cancel. And let's just uh
make it a little bit smaller. Let's just
bring it down like here. Let's do RX.
Just scale it like so. Uh GX. Cool. That
looks okay. Maybe scale it a little bit
more. GZ GY. Let's get rid of the bevel
modifier here. Let's go into edit mode.
Select. Let's select this edge. GZ and
just snap it to this vertex here. Also,
let's make sure align rotation to target
is off. GZ. Let's just snap it to that
vertex here. Let's go into wireframe.
And uh this one can gy GZ. And also snap
it to this vertex here. So, we kind of
something like this. Uh actually, we
should probably just use face instead.
Um and then this one. Let's go into
wireframe. Let's select this. Gy, snap
it to this face. Gy, snap to this face
as well. Uh, and then let's add a mirror
modifier. And let's just select this
object here. Well, actually, it's
definitely going to be noticeable. So,
let's copy over a bevel modifier.
And let's just apply our scale. And
that's way too much. So, let's reduce
that a little bit. Cool. And then we
might have to adjust it. And let's just
go into edit mode and make this a little
bit bigger. I added some sticky notes,
which are just planes that I rotated and
extruded. And uh to move them around,
shift D. And I just used face snapping
to move them around. And then just RX or
whatever axis to rotate them. All right,
let's add a Bobo plushy up here. So I'm
going to shift right click, add a plane,
just like so. Scale it down. Go into
edit mode. You know the deal. And to
support loops already SZ. Just like
that. Let's add Go into object mode.
Let's add a subdivision service
modifier. Let's right click shade
smooth. That looks a little bit too
much. Then let's add some more loop
cuts. Let's go into side view. I want it
a little bit bulky. So, let's go just
like this. Let's turn on proportional
editing. Let's scale that up. Make it a
little bit bulky. Just like that. Cool.
Let's jump there. Kind of looking like a
boba already. Let's go into edit mode.
Let's shift Duplicate this. Right click
cancel. P separated by selection. Let's
go into edit mode. E extrude that up.
And this will kind of be like our cap.
Let's S shift Z. Open it up a little
bit. Right click. Set origin. Origin to
geometry. Let's go uh let's select both
of these. Let's hit insert. just to
insert that a little bit. And then maybe
alt extrude along normals and then just
bring it in just like that. Kind of
something like that. S shift z
kind of like that. And let's just put it
on the top right there. Cool. Just like
that. And then maybe we want another
support loop here just to make it a
little bit more straight there. And uh
let's expand this a little bit more. So
what we can do is select both of them
and go into edit mode and then still
scale it up proportionally. So the top
is also scaling. All right. So, let's uh
turn our proportional editing. And I
don't like how this one is going through
this one. So, what we can do is just
take this entire top face. Let's go out
and just bring it down a little bit so
it's covered there. All right. Now,
let's just select this face right here.
Shift Duplicate. Right click. Cancel.
Piece everybody selection. Then, S,
shift Z. Scale it down. G. Move it over
here. Go into edit mode. E to extrude it
all. If you need to go into wireframe,
you totally can. I'm not. But cool.
Let's tilt it a little bit. Cool. Let's
just squash this down a little bit. Um,
let's move this down. All right, let's
go into local view. Uh, side view.
Doesn't really matter. It's just going
to be another plane. Let's do RX90.
Scale it down. Let's do control 1.
Control 2. Cool. Let's just go into edit
mode. Extrude it out a little bit. Cool.
RZ. Right click. Shade smooth. And um
RZ. Cool. Add modifier. Mirror modifier.
Maybe something like so. Just kind of
like that. RZ GY.
Maybe ext. Maybe bring that out a little
bit more. And for the mouth, let's just
duplicate this. Uh, get rid of the
mirror modifier.
Gy. Let's just snap it to the center
because we have face select. All right.
Let's just do SX. Let's go into edit
mode. Let's add a loop cut here. Let's
go into Let's just bring it down kind of
like so. Maybe scale it down a little
bit. And there we kind of have. All
right, let's add some piano details. I'm
going to add a loop cut. SX GX. Move it
in. Let's h take this face insert a
little bit. E extrude downwards. Let's
just go into edit mode. Shift Duplicate.
Right click. Cancel. Per by selection.
Object. Set origin. Origin to geometry.
Sx. Bring that down. Go into edit mode.
E extrude that upwards. S. All right.
Now I want to add like some clickable
icons. So instead of modeling it, what
the typical workflow is to find an SVG
online and import that into Blender to
use it. So SVG repo has a lot of really
awesome ones that are I think public
domain license. So find, you know,
whatever logo you want. Hopefully it's
here somewhere and just download it.
Just make sure when you click on it, you
check the license. This one's MIT, so
this is fine. And if the logo you're
looking for doesn't exist on SVG repo,
you know, you can just type in your
company logo SVG and try and find a
resource there. Again, just make sure to
check the license. So now what you can
do is come uh here, file, import, and
make sure to select SVG, not SVG as
grease pencil, just regular SVG, and you
can import it. So it imports as a curve.
You can see right here. Now, it might be
extremely small, so you can just scale
it up and just bring it up there. Now,
because it's a curve, we have all those
things that we did when we were making
other curves, right? So, in geometry, we
have this extrude thing that we can
extrude a little bit. And then we also
have this bevel thing right here. So, if
you want to add a little bit of bevel to
the corners, you totally can do that.
So, we can increase that bevel there.
And you can see we it makes it a little
bit more stylized. Just like that. So, I
think that actually looks pretty good
for the GitHub logo. So, once I'm done,
I can convert to mesh. Right click, set
origin origin to geometry. And now it
just be its own object. All right, I'm
going to do the same thing for the other
ones. So again, we go to This time we're
going to go to YouTube. Let's select
YouTube. Let's scale it up. Let's
extrude it a little bit. Let's add some
bevel.
Cool. That looks good. I don't think for
curves you need to apply your scale.
Yeah, it didn't change anything, but
yeah. So, this also looks good. And of
course, when you convert it to a mesh,
well, I guess you don't have to convert
it to a mesh yet until we start getting
to
like the baking stage, but I'm just
going to do it anyway because I kind of
confirmed that I want these like so. You
also'll notice that some of these have
the wrong shading applied. So, you can
right click and shade auto smooth, and
I'll fix that up right there. Okay. Now,
for each of these, I'm just going to add
some sort of background to hold them.
So, cursor to selected and shift A and
add a plane. uh RX90.
Scale it down. Go into edit mode. I
think we can just extrude it this time.
Uh let's go into local view. Let's just
select these edges. Shift G. Select
similar length. Ctrl +B. And just give
it a a small little bevel. Just like
that. Right click, shade, auto smooth.
Let's copy over one of these. Copy. Ctrl
L. Copy modifiers. That's looking good.
And we can just have that send just like
there. And then we can angle it, of
course.
All right, let's add a circle. Um, 16
should be okay. R Y 90. Cool. Let's go
into edit mode. Let's just scale that
down. Shift X like so. Let's go into
edit mode. Let's just extrude that out
on the X-axis.
Let's fill that in. Let's insert that.
And let's extrude that in just to get a
clock like so. Right click, shade, auto
smooth. Let's copy. Let's apply our
scale. Let's copy over a bevel modifier.
Like so. That seems to be too much. So,
we can lower it.
And it looks a little bit too. So, let's
add a subdivision surface modifier of
one. Uh, hands should just be a simple
plane, I guess. I guess you can do it
whatever you want to do it with. Let's
go into edit mode. Let's just e extrude
that out a little bit. I don't want it
too thick. Let's go into wireframe just
to see what that is. Okay. GX. Let's
move it out. GX. And then snap it. Cool.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's get make
sure we select everything. GC GZ. This
will be the hourhand. And then let's
just duplicate that and move it along
the X. SXX.
Make it smaller into ourh hand. And then
let's also just add a cylinder here. And
we probably only need like 10. So I'm
just going to scale that down. Probably
even less than 10. Oh well. R Y90.
Cool. Just like that. Okay. Let's add a
small table. You already know the drill.
We're going to add a plane. We're going
to hit control 2 to give that
subdivision. We're going to e extrude
that out. We're going to give it two
guard loops with controlr. Just like
that. We're going to scale it up. Let's
turn up proportional editing. We're just
going to scale it up. Right. We're going
to right click, shade smooth. Just like
that. And for the legs, you already know
the drill. We're just going to shift
duplicate, right click, cancel. We're
going to go into coffee. We're going to
go scale this down just like so. Let's
go into wireframe just to get an
arbitrary size that we want. We're going
to add a mirror modifier right here.
We're going to select this object as our
mirror object. And we're also going to
do it on the Y-axis. Then we're going to
go into edit mode. And what we're going
to do is probably select this bottom
face here. Hit control plus to select
that control loop up there. GZ. And
we're just going to snap it down to the
bottom. Just like that. And then if we
want, we can we can scale that up a
little bit. And maybe maybe even make it
a little bit more round by bringing that
up. And then we got something really
really cute and stylized in that. We can
do RX and then R Y90. And then we have
something really really cute like that.
SZZ. Just bring it up just like that.
And there we have our table desk thing.
All right. For the pizza, you already
know the deal. We're going to take this.
We're going to shift duplicate. Right
click. Cancel. P separate by selection.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's add two.
Well, since it's rotated, let's do alt R
so it's back to the default rotation.
Not that we have to. It's just easier to
work with. Let's add two loop cuts here.
Let's scale them down. Maybe sx. Let's
add another one here. Let's go into edit
mode. Let's just bring this forward just
to make a pizza shape. Just like that.
We definitely need one back here just to
give it, you know, some pizza shape.
Let's go into edit mode. Let's e extrude
that down. There we got a nice cute
pizza. Maybe we want to give some
stylization here and scale that up a
little bit. I don't know. Really up to
you there. For the crust, I think I'm
just going to go in edit mode, hold
control, select all that. P separate by
selection. Go into edit mode. Just like
that. Let's go into edit mode. AE
extrude outwards. Kind of like so. Let's
reset. Set origin origin to geometry.
Let's gy move it in there. Sz scale it
up. Sx. And just adjust it like so. And
you know, really up to you at this point
here. Let's go in the pizza. And I don't
like how it's so round. So, let's add a
guard loop here and just make it flatter
at the bottom. Uh, I don't know. I don't
think I want one for the crust. Maybe I
do. I don't know. Really up to you
there. So, for the cheese, what we're
going to do is go into edit mode. Just
select all these top faces right here.
Hit Ctrl+ to increase your selection.
You can see it gets the top half of the
pizza. What we're going to do, shift D,
click right click cancel. If we separate
by selection, and you can double click
to select the overlapping thing. And
then you can just scale it up just a
little bit. So, like so. Then what you
can do is rightclick and subdivide as
necessary. And then once you subdivide,
turn on proportional editing like so and
just edit the cheese like so and make a
cheese around there. Of course, if you
always need more geometry, you can
totally do that. And if you feel like
places don't want cheese, you can
actually select the face and delete
those faces like so. And then you can
just come around and keep on adjusting
your cheese all around. Maybe this
doesn't need a face here. And uh get
some nice looking pizza cheese just like
that. Of course, you can also get rid of
edge loops that you don't want either
with Ctrl X. So once you get some
good-looking cheese, you can see I added
a bunch of loop cuts and whatnot for my
cheese. Of course, we can add a solidify
modifier just like this. Let's bring it
up here and let's change the thickness
just to give it, you know, some depth to
that cheese. Now it looks really, really
cheesy. For the toppings like pepperoni,
let's just use this P separate by
selection. Let's go into edit mode. E
extrude upwards. I insert a little bit
extrude downwards. There we kind of
already have a pepperoni that we can put
along our pizza. Just like that. For an
onion, we can actually just duplicate
this and go into local view and delete
the bottom and top faces. Now, it's a
little bit messed up because we don't
have this side, but we'll never see it
because it's blocked by the cheese
itself. And then you can just add like
two loops cuts here to give it a little
bit more rigidness. And now what you
have here is an onion ring. Typically, I
don't think I would take that approach
with an onion ring unless it's to save
time. I would probably use like a
cylinder. Definitely not 32, but I would
select both of these sides like here. I
I would sorry I would insert them first
then delete them then select both of
these edge loops like so and then
control E bridge edge loops and then
this is definitely more of an onion ring
rhyme and then I would add like a loop
cut here. So one for the white part and
then one for the purple part and then if
you wanted inner purple part you could
totally add another loop cut there just
for the inner purple part as well. Uh
but just to save time if you wanted to
go the other route that I just showed
you you totally could. There will be
differences in topology, but you know,
it kind of really just depends on on
your scene and your vibe. So, I
definitely want some leaves on my pizza.
So, again, that's going to be the same
thing. I'm going to shift duplicate,
right click, anzo piece, rever, alt, r,
reset our rotation, just like so. Let's
go into edit mode. Let's add, I don't
know, maybe two loop cuts. Let's sx
scale that down. Let's add another one
here. And let's just bring that down
just like so. And uh let's uh go into
edit mode. Probably bring gy bring this
up. Maybe this one specifically. And
then use some proportional editing.
Cool.
And then add loop cuts just to make the
shape of your leaf for your pizza.
Really up to you what you want there for
your leaf. And then of course you want
to add a solidify modifier. Again, we
want to solidify before subdivided. And
there we can have like a leaf for our
pizza. Cool. You can see I have my pizza
here and my leaves here. And I'm just
adjusting uh the the the roundness a
little bit just manually. Um, not too
big a deal. I'm trying to reduce the
amount of olu lap as much as possible,
but we'll come back and uh deal with all
that later. So, now we kind of have a
really, really cute piece of pizza. For
the soda can, you already know what
we're going to do. We're going to take
this shifty duplicate, right click,
cancel P, separate by selection, alt R,
reset that rotation, go into edit mode.
Let's e extrude that up. Let's go into
local view just so we get rid of
everything. Let's add controlr, two loop
cuts, SZ just to scale it up. Just like
that. Let's change the whole can just
like that. Let's maybe add three more
loop cuts in the center here just to
give it some bulkiness. So let's go into
wireframe. Let's make sure we select
that. Let's turn on proportional editing
with O. Let's hit S just to scale it.
And let's just bulk it up kind of like
that. Make it a little bit cute. Just
like that. Then for this top here, let's
I to insert that a little bit. And let's
just E and extrude that down. And this
is way too smooth. So what we can do is
actually insert again. And then we get a
control loop right there for the ring
around that. Super cool. And then for
that pin thing, what we can do is shift
D, duplicate, right click, cancel P,
separate by selection. Then right click,
set origin, origin to geometry. Scale
that down, make it SX. Probably add a
loop cut here. Let's select both of
these faces. Let's hit I to insert. And
then I hit I again for individual faces.
And just hit X and delete those faces.
Let's go into edit mode. Eextrude that
up just like so. That looks pretty good.
And then for the little pin in there,
what we can do again is shift duplicate
right click cancel piece upward by
selection click set origin origin to
geometry. Scale this down. Go into edit
mode. Hit AE extruded upwards. Shift S
selection to cursor. Scale that down and
just put it like that. There we kind of
have our our soda can. And then we can
give some adjustments here. So maybe we
want it a little bit inside on the
Whoops. Let's turn off proportional
editing. And maybe we want a little bit
of the inside over here. And then
another one on the top here. This gives
it some a little bit more of a Coke
bottle shape. So we can have another one
possibly.
It's giving more of a can vibe this way.
Same thing down here. For this, we can
probably inset and e extrude down a
little bit. And then if you want to add
more detail, you can totally add more
detail. Um, but I think just one
extrusion down. This was good enough for
a stylized can. And I'm actually going
to get rid of the bottom extrude because
it's going to be covered up from the
top. If you want to rotate it, can you
can leave it for more realism, but I
think what I'm just going to do is add
like a guard loop over here. And
honestly, just scale this down kind of
like so. Um, so it has some resemblance
of a bottom there. Okay, let's just add
something here to fill up the empty
space. I'm going to shift duplicate RZ
90. Let's see if that's the right way.
Cool. It is. Let's just move it over
here. Cool. Bring it up. S Y. So, this
time I also want a hanging plant, but
we're going to do it a little bit
differently this time because I want a
lot of them. So, I'm actually going to
use this thing that we created really,
really early. Uh, this sort of bold sort
of looking thing. I just realized it's
really inside there. And I think for
this one, I'm going to reuse this. So,
I'm going to shift duplicate, shift S,
selection to cursor up there, like so.
And then for this one, I think what I'm
going to do is add a loop cut here and
just bring it in like that. So then it
becomes more of like a vase. So this
will be more like a hanging plant pot.
Whereas let's do S, shift C, and just
bring it out a little bit. This will be
like a plant, you know, like a bowl to
hold a plant. So this is more like a
vase of flowers. And then here is going
to be like a bowl of hanging plant. Uh
let's just add a bezier curve. Well,
this is also a bezier curve. So, I'm
just going to shift duplicate this
bezier curve that we created earlier.
Shift S, selection to cursor, keep
offset. I'm definitely going to make the
stem a little bit thinner. So, I'm going
to come over here and in round I'm just
going to turn down the resolution a
little bit. Cool. Maybe something like
that. And I'm just going to reshape it
into like a hanging plant sort of vibe.
So, um you know what I'm going to do is
put it around here. Move this down like
so. Probably rotate this for sure.
Move that down.
Move this down. Definitely rotate. Give
that a rotation
like so. Probably definitely extrude
that. So, the next thing we have to do
is make another leaf. So, if you want to
copy one of our old leaves, like this
pizza thing. This is making me so
hungry. Oh my gosh. Uh, but if you want
to, you could totally do that. But what
I'm going to do is probably just, you
know, shift A, add another plane, and
make a completely new leaf. So, I'm just
going to bring that up. And the only
reason I'm making a new leaf is just for
variety, but like you definitely don't
have to. Like, I don't know if a lot of
people can tell that it's a new leaf or
not, especially when you're like
scattering it. So, you know, it's really
up to you. But, you know, I'm just going
to create a really really basic new leaf
like so arbitrary shape. If you want to,
you can import like a reference and
whatnot and like,
you know, create something cool like
that. So again, probably control 1.
Yeah, control one is more than enough
for this sort of leaf. Let's just go
into edit mode and let's just add a
center here. Door control B just to
bevel it. Move our mouse up once just to
get the center one. And then let's just
hold control to pick the shortest path.
And like our other leaves, let's just GZ
and move it down a little bit. Kind of
like so. And let's add a solidify
modifier. Again, we want to solidify it
before the subdivision. So we can
increase that a little bit. And I think
this time instead of extruding it from
the leaf itself, what we can do instead
is add a cylinder.
And 32 is way too many. I think I'll go
with 12 cuz it's going to be really
really small. So I'm just going to 12
might be overkill, but whatever. Or X90.
And then shade auto smooth. Move it
somewhere over here.
Let's go into edit mode. Select this
face and just extend out a little bit.
Kind of like so. can do is add a few
loop cuts on here like so. And then with
proportional editing and selecting this
like so, we can give it a slight tape
taper. So, we can just scale it down a
little bit. Again, if you want to use
the taper modifier thing, the simple
deform thing that we used earlier, you
totally could. I'm just doing it
manually because it's faster and you
have more control
for what we're doing here. So, I kind of
want to keep it somewhat equal to the
scale of the leaf. Cool. And when you're
happy with that, what you can do is F3,
convert to mesh. If you wanted to save a
copy of it, you totally could, but I
think I'm good with that. So now I'm
just going to hit Ctrl + J and join them
together so it's one single object.
Cool. Let's apply our scale and
everything. Make sure everything's okay.
I feel like this has to be a bit a
little bit bigger. So I'm going to do
Ctrl L and just Whoops. Let's turn off
proportion SY and just scale it up just
a little bit. Kind of like so. Now what
we can do is go into edit mode and
probably turn on proportional editing.
give some sort of distortions to this.
Now we need to reset this origin point
to over here. So what we can do is just
hit control period G Y in this case and
just snap it to this face right here and
control period to confirm that.
Alternatively, you could just select
this shift S cursor to selected. It will
snap to that selected face. And then you
could do object set origin origin to 3D
cursor. Nothing changed because we
already set it there anyway. This is
necessary because we're going to be
using a particle system and that origin
point is going to be based on that
particle system. Now, what we can do
once you have a curve that you like. So,
I'm just going to duplicate this because
we're going to be using it several times
for multiple hanging plants. Once you
have a curve that you like, you can F3
and convert it to a mesh. Then, you can
do the same thing we did last time. So,
we can come over here. Oh, well, we
could have filled caps first. Oh, well,
we can just hit F to fill that now. and
then select it and then you know just
kind of taper it off with whatever you
want to go for. Okay, now we can select
this mesh right and add a particle
system right here and just hit plus. Now
you can see it looks like a bunch of
blobs. So let's change it to hair
instead. Now we don't want that many
because there's so many. So what we can
do is set it to like 100 and see what
that gives us. Now, instead of like hair
particles like you see here, we want to
use the object that we created, this
leaf right here. Under render, instead
of as path, we're going to render as
object. And then the instance object,
the object that we're going to instance
across this curve is going to be our
leaf. So, we can just eyeball this leaf
right here. And you can see our leaf is
right there. Now, in render, you can
adjust the scale of it as well as the
scale randomness. You can see some
leaves are going to be random whereas
others are not. Cool. Now, it doesn't
look particularly realistic because
everything is kind of like on one side.
Maybe you like that, but I don't. So,
what I'm going to do is tick advanced.
And you can see when I hit advanced,
there's going to be this new thing here
called rotation. So, we can click on
rotation. You can see we can change it
through like normal and then change the
phase. Uh you can try velocity here,
which is the default, which might work
for you. Yeah, just play around with
something that you like. I mean, go
through these. I don't really know
honestly. I would honestly just trial
and error at this point. And of course,
you can like adjust the number of leaves
that you want and the overall size of
it. And then you also you can still
change the number and the length and
then also the seed, you know, like
Minecraft seeds and whatnot. So if you
want to, you can just reuse this similar
thing and do it again. But particle
systems act like materials. So if you
adjust this one, it's going to adjust
the other one as well. So what you want
to do instead is hit this copy thing
here. So you can give a name to it if
you want or you just hit copy and it'll
automatically add 01. And now you can
see when I edit this one, it's not going
to edit this one. It's only editing this
one here. So they kind of act the same
as materials. Now if you do want to
adjust the curve, well, you still have
that option, too, right? It doesn't have
to be a curve to edit it. You can edit
it in its mesh form as well. So yeah,
that way you don't have to create a
bunch of curves. But again, we still
have our other curve here that you can
adjust as a bezier and do all the
transformations that we did earlier if
you wanted to go that route. And for my
emitter object, you can see if I adjust
it here, it's going to affect my other
particle system. So, if you're kind of
happy with what it is, what you can do
is just hide it. That way, uh, you don't
have to accidentally think about it and
stuff like that. And then what I think
I'm going to do is just have one extra
curve here. just delete it and just put
like a small little patch inside here.
Kind of like so. Let's just delete those
extra vertices that we don't need. Um
like so just the bottom of here. We can
definitely uh duplicate this one and
tone down the number. So it might be a
little bit messed up close up, but from
far away, you know, no one's going to be
able to tell. It kind of just looks like
a pot that's filled with a bunch of
leaves, right? Actually, now that I
think about it, I don't think uh this
actually gives the vibe I'm going for.
Like, even if I make it really big and
stylized. Um, so I could probably spend
some time changing the leaf, but I don't
think it overall matches the scene
anyway. So, I'm actually just going to
get rid of that. I think maybe what I
put in here is like a bowl of eggs. So,
I'm just going to like shift Duplicate P
separate by selection, double click to
select that, and probably just extrude
this up. Um, set origin origin to
geometry. I don't know, like a bird's
nest sort of thing. Like I don't know.
Yeah, you know, use your imagination. I
don't actually know because I haven't
planned this in advance. Um, but you
know, I'm just going to I'm just going
to make like a bowl of eggs or
something. So, that's a little bit funny
and a little bit cute at the same time.
So, there's a bit of empty space here.
So, I want to add a wall outlet. So,
what I'm going to do is shift A and
probably search for a plane. Let's just
do R Y90 like so. Let's scale it down
into like an arbitrary wall outlet
shape. It doesn't really have to be
exact. That looks okay. Then what we can
do is probably extrude it out just a
little bit
and maybe scale that down a little bit.
Then what we can do is hit A, select
everything, subdivide it, subdivide it,
subdivide it. And this looks okay. Then
we can select like these three and
probably just extrude it in. And then
for the this one, I think we can just
hit I to insert and then maybe S to make
it a little bit smaller. and then GZ and
then just insert that as well. Cool.
Then let's copy over a bevel modifier.
So I'm just going to copy over from
here. Cropy modifiers. Cool. So that's
one of our outlets. And let's just add
an array modifier like so. That looks
okay. We can increase the X just a
little bit like so. And I want it ver
horizontally. So I'm going to do it like
that.
And if you want to give it a back, you
totally can. So if you want to do that,
we can just go into edit mode. We can
just select any one of these faces.
Shift Duplicate, right click, cancel P,
separate by selection.
And let's get rid of the ray modifier.
Let's get rid of the bevel modifier
object. Set origin origin to geometry.
And just scale it up. GZ.
Go out S Y Gy Sz.
Cool. And then I guess we can extrude
this out a little bit.
And let's go into wireframe and just
select that and just move uh this out.
Cool. Just like that. And then we have
our wall outlet.
And since it's so small, I'm actually
going to get rid of the bevel on this
one. Okay. Now, I want to add some text.
So, the really nice thing is that
there's this text object right here. And
if you rotate it and go into edit mode,
you can just start typing. And you have
all the features that you would have.
Well, not all, but a lot of the features
that you would have of a regular text
box like on PowerPoint or Word and so on
so forth. Like I can hit A. I can hold
shift to type. I can hit enter for a new
line. So on so forth. I can do Ctrl +B
to bold or control I for italic italic.
Nothing's changing here because in the
font itself, the default font uses the
same font for the regular, the bold,
italic, and so on so forth. So what you
can do is go online like Google Fonts or
Font Space and find a font that you
like. Not every font will work properly,
but you know, just play around until you
find something that you like and that
works. Then you just download it. You
don't have to install it on your
computer. You can just download it on
your computer. And then when you have it
downloaded, you can navigate to there to
your fonts wherever you downloaded it.
It doesn't have to be in the fonts
folder. If you put in downloads, that's
fine as well. So here, I can just try
some random one. And you can see I tried
this one. And you can see I tried that
one and it updated there. Now, this
isn't updated because technically it's
bolded. So, I'd have to update the bold
version of the font as well. You can see
if I retype it though, it's going to be
okay. And then you have a a lot of
really, really cool options here. So,
let me choose a different font, maybe
like a black. If I come over here and do
none, you can see it's only going to
keep the outline. And then if I do
extrude, you can see it's going to
extrude that. And then you kind of get
like this, I don't know, like
surrounding text sort of vibe, which is
really cool. And then you also have this
thing like bevel, right? So, you can
bevel it up. Um, so you can combine
these and and see what you get and see
what you like. When you're going for
like static image renders, you know,
leaving it as a text object is
completely fine. We need to convert it
to a mesh. So, let me just show you. If
I F3, convert this to a mesh and go into
edit mode. You can see now it becomes a
mesh itself, and you can't edit the text
anymore. With typing, it's just like an
actual object now that you move around
and adjust. Now, when it comes to text,
it there usually is a lot of issues with
the topology. As you can tell, this is a
really really bad mess. Some fonts are
better than others, but this one is this
one is okay for like the I's and and the
K's and so so on so forth, but for
these, you know, it's definitely a
little bit suspicious. One thing I know
is that there's usually a lot of
overlapping vertices. So, hit A to
select everything, hit M to merge
vertices by distance, and set it to like
0001. You can see I removed 7,839
vertices and nothing visually changed at
all. So, it just got rid of all those
overlapping vertices, which saved some
information. Depending on your font, you
can get away with the rematch modifier
and turning down the voxil size until
you get something you like. The issue
with using this rematch modifier is,
take a look at my scene statistics. This
is 76,000 vertices. This right alone,
let me get rid of it. You can see it's
45,000.
So, if I read it, by the time I get to
something really small that looks good,
it's going to start lagging my computer.
And you can see now it's 682,000
vertices. And it still looks a little
bit suspicious close up. You also have
this option here like blocks, which you
can increase the octry depth and
hopefully get something. But you should
be careful with this because if you go
too high, it's going to crash your file
and maybe even crash your computer. The
downside of Blender is that there's very
few safeguards when it comes to
parameters. So, just be careful with
that. For a lot of fonts, remsh doesn't
work. And for this font, it seems like
remsh isn't working either. You can see
when I duplicate this and apply the
modifier what it actually does. So, if I
go into edit mode, you can see if I get
really really close, everything is like
starting into becoming into quads. So,
the topology is definitely better, but
there's way too many quads here. What
you could do is go into edit mode, a
select everything, and unsubdivide.
Again, if your computer can't handle it,
don't even bother. Uh, you also have
like this decimate modifier here that
you can play with. Unsubdivide or
collapse and just bring this down and
it'll kind of merge some of the
geometries. Again, be careful with these
methods because it might crash your
computer. If it's like this, you know,
it's fine just to leave it unless it's
causing shading issues during baking. If
you don't know what that is, that's
totally okay. If there's no shading
issues, if it looks fine, then it's okay
just to leave text as is. If you need to
fix it up, then yeah, you would spend
some time tracing the font and remaking
yourself or just get a better font that
works out of the box. There's very few
fonts I know that work out of the box,
but some fonts will work better with the
rematch modifier than others. Okay,
let's make some lights that hang from
here and here. So, the first thing we
need is a light bulb. So, I'm just going
to shift a at a plane. Again, we want
the subdivision surface. You already
know where we're going to go. We're
going to e extrude upwards like that.
We're going to add two loop cuts just
like this. This will be kind of the
base. And maybe one more support loop up
here. So, it's kind of like that. Right
click, shade smooth. Cool. Now, we can
just select this top, extrude it
outwards. Probably expand that a little
bit. Maybe make it a little bit longer.
And then just one more bracing loop
right here. And maybe we scale that
down. Cool. Uh let's just scale this up
just a little bit more just to give it a
more light bulb sort of a shape. Cool.
And there's kind of like our light bulb.
Maybe we can select this bottom face.
Plus, plus
uh maybetrl+ one more time. Hit alt s
and just scale that down a little bit.
Cool. Uh and then I think we just P
separate by selection here. That way
it's kind of separate from the bulb
itself. And let's just select both of
these. Right click, set origin origin to
geometry. And uh let's just scale this
one up. Oops. All right. There I have my
light bulb. So let's just check if one
is enough. So one is definitely not
enough. So, I'm going to keep it at two.
I'm just going to convert these to a
mesh now. And then I'm going to join
them together just like so. Now, what we
can do is use an So, let's just do RX90.
Whoops. Let's just hit minus so it goes
this way. And let's just shift S cursor
to selected. Let's shift A and add a
path curve. Cool. Let's add an array
modifier for this one. Let's just
increase the X a little bit. And I don't
know, maybe like six. Then, let's add a
curve modifier like so. And just select
the path that we created.
So now once we edit this curve, it
should be around it should be adjusting
uh our thing. So if we make it really
long, we can increase the array modifier
here. And you can see that we're going
to get some more light bulbs just like
that. You could also use the particle
system method that we used earlier,
which is totally valid as well. Uh but
I'm just going to be using this method.
So now all I have to do is just move
this into the hanging position. So,
uh, I want to one going over there and
one over going over there. So, that's
all I'm going to be doing. Of course,
for the curve itself, we definitely want
to give it some depth.
So, I'm just going to increase that. So,
shift right click, shift S, selection to
cursor.
Then, let's select this one. Shift right
click here. Shift S, selection to
cursor.
And then, we can just adjust these like
so.
Uh we can also resize these just a
little bit if they're too big. Cool. And
then we can also adjust, you know, how
much how the factor here as well. Now we
just duplicate this. Shift Duplicate.
And same thing what we can do. Same
thing. Let's just uh go into edit mode.
Select this probably over here. Shift
STction to cursor over here as well.
Probably somewhere over here. Shift S,
selection to cursor. And we can just
adjust the curve accordingly. And here
we probably only need four rather than
five.
And we can set a little bit stronger of
an offset. And then we can remove some
extra vertices that we don't need. So we
didn't need five vertices there. Cool.
Let's go to top view and just move that
in. Uh and then it looks like four is
too many. And then maybe we can do gy
and just move this along the curve just
a little bit more. Now they do seem to
be a little bit off. So what we can do
is go into edit mode and gz and just
move it up a little bit. And now you can
see it's kind of inside which is okay.
Now it looks like it's not centered. So
we can go into edit mode and g y just a
tad bit. Maybe one more g y. Cool. And
if you wanted to go through it, you can
do gz and just move it up just a little
bit more. And now you can see it's
running through that. Oh, I guess I
should have done it with this one as
well. Oh well. GZ. Just move it up a
little bit. Uh go into edit mode. Now
this one's too far ahead. So we can just
move it out slightly. Cool. g y just one
more time. And when you're done, you can
just uh you know convert them to a mesh.
F3, convert to mesh. And then if you
need to make any adjustments, you can
totally go into edit mode and turn on
proportional editing and just make some
adjustments. Or, you know, honestly go
here, ctr L, and like and select this.
Ctrl L and delete these as well. Or of
course, you know, you can just select
it. Ctrl L to select linked stuff and
just move it where you need it to be. So
if you want to rotate around the wire,
you can just actually select a portion
of the wire. Something like that. Shift
S, cursor to selected, it will snap
around there. Then hitting period key,
you can change to 3D cursor pivot point,
which is the same thing we were doing up
here. Transform pivot point. You can
just use the period key and switch to
that. Then in edit mode on this, select
anything, ctr L just to select linked.
And now you can just do R R and it'll
rotate around that 3D cursor. Of course,
you can use the other ones as well. Um,
but I'm going to go back to bounding box
center. And I actually kind of like the
rotations that it already gave us. Yeah.
Now, let's add some floorboards. I did
remove the egg thing and the pizza thing
and the foot rest cuz I don't know what
I want here yet. But let's just do the
floor anyway. All right. Let's go into
local view because right now I want to
add some floor planks. So, what I'm
going to do is select this shift
duplicate right click cancel piece of by
selection. And what I'm going to do is
probably expand this on the SY. So, for
now, I'm just going to leave it like
this. And let's reset set origin origin
to geometry. And what I'm going to do is
add as many loop cuts as thick as you
want your planks. So if you want your
planks this thick, then you would add
this many loop cuts. Like each plank is
this thick. And now what we can do is
add three loop cuts cuz I want an
alternating pattern. If you want to uh
add more alternating pattern, you can
add more loop cuts and adjust them as
necessary. But I'm going to make mine
fairly even. So now what I'm going to do
is shift alt and select all of these
loop cuts. And I'm going to select on
this one. And then I'm going to just
alternate. So two and then one and then
two and then one and then two. Of
course, if you want, you can also start
with two. One, two, one, so on so forth.
Now what we can do is just hit bevel,
crb to bevel, but make it really, really
small. Just like that. And then we can
delete those faces. And now what we can
do is a e and just extrude upwards. Make
sure to apply our scale. And then what
we can do is add a bevel modifier just
like so. And shading. I definitely want
to harden the normals. Maybe turn up to
like three segments. And then we can
just adjust the amount until we get some
planks that we like. So that looks
really nice. So I think I'm just going
to leave it like that. Okay. Let's make
sure they're not overlapping. I guess we
probably should have done the planks
first, but that's totally okay. We can
just go into wireframe, select both of
these, and just GZ and move it down like
so. Make sure everything is resting
here. Just like that. Okay. Okay, for
like a wall outlet, we can probably add
like a cylinder just to cover something
up. 32 is way too many. Let's just do
12. Let's just scale that down over the
outlet. RX90, just like so. Then we can
probably select this face, extrude it,
and just Whoops. Definitely not.
Proportional editing. Then we can just
select this and expand it a little bit.
Uh, and then right click, shade auto
smooth. Maybe scale this down a little
bit more so it's a little bit more
defined. And then there you can just use
like a curve to plug it in. And then I'm
just going to shifty duplicate this
curve and shift S selection to cursor
just like so. And I'm just going to
adjust this over here. And GX move it a
little bit. RZ kind of like so. Let's
just move it like that. And now it kind
of looks like we're using our curve
outlet. Uh and you can see if I hide
this real quick, you can see I did the
same exact thing for the computer as
well. All right, let's add like a cap to
the top here. So what I'm going to do is
probably shift right click somewhere and
just shift a add a plane. like so. And
I'm just going to scale it down, you
know, about a little bit sized above the
thing. Let's just go into edit mode and
let's just gy bring it over here. Let's
add a loop cut here about the same size.
And let's just do ex and snap it over.
And then I want it lingering a little
bit over the edge of the room.
We can go in edit mode and just extrude
upwards. If you want to give it a
solidify modifier instead, just to see
how it looks first, you can totally do
that. And I kind of want one for the
bottom as well. So, let me just move
this down. Let's just go in here and
let's go into edit mode. Select this.
Shift Duplicate. Right click cancel. B
separate by selection. You already know
how it is. Double click just to get
that. Um, let's just scale it up.
Whoops. Let's do right click, set origin
origin to geometry. Scale that up just a
little bit. I don't know, maybe about
the same out as the other one. Right. So
about here. I'm just lining that up and
lining this up here. If it's not
perfect, it's totally fine. We can just
extrude that out. Apply our scale. Uh
let's come over here. Ctrl L. Copy
modifiers. Cool. And then I think I want
a little bit more detail here at the
top. So what I'm going to do is go into
edit mode. Let's just select this. And
uh let's just make this up a little bit.
And then for this thing, let's go and
let's go into solid mode. And let's go
and just select these bottom faces here.
Let's uh insert them a little bit. And
then extrude downwards. So there we kind
of have something like that. Cool. And
maybe what we can do is
let's see B be these.
That way it's got a little bit more
style. What we can try instead is maybe
a custom inset. So, if we do Crl +B and
then we come over to the bevel menu.
Whoops. Let's come over to the bevel
menu. We can come to custom profile type
and kind of just make it inverted this
way instead. That also looks pretty
cool. So, I'm going to shade auto smooth
this one. Um, that's cool. Uh,
additionally, if you don't like doing it
that way, you can just do Ctrl +B and
instead of custom super ellipse and then
just change the shape inward a little
bit and that would kind of give you a
similar effect. So shape by default is
0.5. We can just bring that down just a
little bit like so. Definitely a little
bit less sharp than if we make a custom
one. So let's just see if we can do
something like a cool bend. That looks
pretty sick actually. But like honestly
just find something that you like. All
right. So the next thing is kind of a
combination of everything. We're going
to be doing materials. We're going to be
joining objects. We're going to be
deleting things and saving information
and space in our GB file. So, this one
is going to be a pretty pretty intense
section. So, what I like to do at this
point, if you're not organized with your
collections, which I am definitely not
organized with my collections or naming
conventions at all, what you should do
is come up here and file and save
incremental or save a copy. Save
incremental will just add a one to your
Blender file and create a completely new
copy, which is what I like to do. So,
just save incremental and you can see it
says room portfolio 1.blend. And now you
can come over here and file save as. And
you can see that we have these two the
our original one and then we also have
the one that we are currently on. And
you can rename that if you want to. So
typically when I'm working on a new
project, I also I set some initial
materials as I'm working and I delete
phases as I'm working. So it's kind of a
wishy back and forth. There's no reason
in particular for this video that I'm
doing it in this order other than I just
want distinct sections for this video.
So, let's go first into either material
preview or rendered mode. And make sure
to change your render engine from EV to
cycles because we're going to be baking
our lights or saving the calculated
light data into our image textures.
Again, if you don't know what that is,
that's totally okay. Just uh know for
now that we should be in cycles. And for
your viewport thing, make sure to tone
down the max samples. It might start
really high like 256. you know, adjust
it, you know, to your computer, what
your computer can handle smoothly. If
your computer can handle more, you can
definitely increase that. And then you
can also turn on this D noiseis thing,
which will kind of get rid of some of
the fuzz. So, what we can do is just
come over here and drag up a new window.
If you don't like that, you can just hit
F3 and split view. And you can choose
one of these, and then it'll give you
the same sort of option there. You can
also rightclick and just do join down or
right click and vertical split, and
it'll kind of give you the same thing
there. So, let's come over here and
switch this to the shader editor where
we edit our materials
and let's change it from object to
world. This will change our world
lighting. So, let's go back into
rendered mode and let's search for a sky
texture. And let's just plug that in
right here. So, what this will do, it'll
add a builtin sky texture for us from
Blender. And let's just hide this entire
background for now. So, I'm just going
to hide that. So, we have a lot of
options here. We can do like the
rotation of the sun to change the
sunlight, the strength of it, the sun
size, which which pretty much
determines, you know, how how smooth the
shadow is. If you want a really harsh
shadow, for example, you can have a
really small sun size or you can have go
for something a little bit softer. You
can always adjust your lighting later.
You so you know, don't put too much
pressure on yourself to get the lighting
correct at the very moment. Okay, cool.
So now what we can do is select anything
and then let's go back to object mode
and give it some materials. So this one
I'll call floor plank. Floor plank. So
initially we can just start with with
basic colors for now. So for planks, I
don't know. I think I'm going for
something a little more stylized. So, I
might bring this down and instead of
making it like the cliche brown that you
expect, I might uh, you know, make it
make it a little bit reddish like uh the
Acadia trees in in in Minecraft or
something like pink or something. Uh,
you know, but again, really up to your
scene and what you're trying to go for.
I forgot to mention like make sure to
set this to your GPU if you have a good
GPU because it'll speed up
significantly. And I'm also going to
turn on D noiseis just so I don't blind
you guys with all my noise. And there's
also this noise threshold thing which
where you can adjust how much noise you
want it to get through. Obviously the
more noise the more performant. But the
more you know fuzzy it's going to look
when you when you move around like D
noiseis you can see all that fuzz uh
without there. So when you're in D
noiseis also make sure to click use GPU
if you have a good G GPU because it'll
run a lot faster that way. Render will
come back to that. Right now, we're just
dealing with the viewport. Now, if you
don't like manually getting your colors,
what you can do is find a color palette
that you like online, maybe like this
one, and just export it as an image. And
then back in Blender, what we can do is
come over here and go into the image
editor and hit open and just navigate to
that color file. So now what I can do is
select this, select this eyropper tool,
and just select from my color palette
here. Right, just like that. Cool.
That's really that's a really really
handy thing. Again, it doesn't have to
be a color palette. It can be any image
that you like the colors of. You can
just sample from that image. You have a
lot of other properties here that will
adjust how your material reacts to
light. I'm not going to be covering that
in this video primarily because it won't
be affecting much of what we're going to
be doing. Now, there's a lot of other
material properties that comes with the
default principled BSDF shader that will
affect the way that your material looks.
For us, however, I'm kind of just
sticking only to the roughness slider,
which basically determines how shiny it
is, you can see if I move it to zero,
it's really, really shiny. And if I move
it up, it's going to be very matte and
flat pastley kind of color, right? So
again, roughness, you can imagine a
really rough surface is like dirt. Dirt
is really rough. So when light goes in
there, it scatters, right? And something
smooth like a knife or a sword is really
shiny. The metal is really shiny. And
that's because it's going to bounce off
those light rays just like that. So the
higher the roughness, the more like dirt
it is. The lower the roughness, the more
metal metalish it kind of is. And of
course, you also have like this metallic
slider that you can play with as well.
But when it comes to colors, I'm just
going to be adjusting the roughness
primarily rather than anything over
here. Now, another alternative to
creating materials is what we call
procedural materials. So instead of just
using regular base colors, we use math
functions to adjust those colors in
certain ways until they look like
something else. For example, if I search
for a noise texture and holding control
shift and click on this will allow me
just to quickly preview it, you can see
the noise texture is a bunch of black
and white. Well, we know that Blender
behind the scenes is all math, right?
That's why metallic goes from 0 to one
and roughness goes from 0 to one. Right?
We have all these mathematical values
that we're just changing and Blender is
just calculating that for us. For a
noise texture, visually what is
happening here is that the black values
are the values that are closer to zero
and the whiter values are the ones that
are closer to one. Which means if we
take some sort of color, so instead of,
you know, showing like zeros and ones
all across this floor, it's just going
to show a grayscale value. So the more
black it is, the closer it is to zero.
And the more white it is, the more close
it is to one. So how do we use a noise
texture to change, you know, like the
darkness or the color of our color at
different points? Like for example, this
place would be more brown and this place
would be uh more light brown, for
example. Well, we can't just plug this
in here. You can see if I do control
shift and click on that, we don't
actually see anything because this is
not a color value. However, if we take
the color value and put it in there. So,
what we see now is that we're not
providing any color values for this
noise texture to select from. So, what
it's doing is just selecting colors from
like the rainbow spectrum or the visible
spectrum or whatever color space it's
operating in. So, let's take a look at a
places that are very very noticeably
different along the rainbow spectrum.
So, purple and red. So, let's take a
look at purple and red areas. So, this
seems to be red, but I don't know if I
can find any specifically red places.
This kind of red, but anyway, let's take
a look at this dark blue and violet sort
of area. So, if I go back just to the
regular noise texture, you can see that
it's very black. Well, it's not
completely black. It's like a grayscale
black. That means the value is closer to
zero. So if you can imagine a spectrum
like this, all the way to the left would
be zero, which would be completely
purple. All the way to the right is one,
which is completely red. So right now
it's just sampling between values
between 0 and one across this sort of
color spectrum. So for these these uh
wider spaces, we can expect them to be a
shade of yellowish orange um or slightly
red. These aren't really that dark. So,
we can probably expect these lighter
areas to be about uh you know right here
like 0.7 or 0.6 or something like that.
And if I go back here, you can see
indeed the lighter areas, keep an eye on
this lighter area is around orange,
close to red, right? Right. It's
orang-ish yellowish. Um or honestly, it
might be close to red, but that's
essentially what it's doing. So, what we
need to do is add a color ramp node. Oh,
if I plug in the color ramp node, I just
want to show you what that does real
quick. We get this sort of grayish
color, right? And how does that make
sense? Well, what we have here is a
scale pretty much from or a range I
should say from zero to one of black
representing zero and white representing
one. And then you have this thing here
called a factor slider that determines
you know how much we want to go to one
side of the color or zero in this case
is black versus to on another side which
is one which means completely white. So
you can think if I change it to like
0.782 it's going to sample right here
and give it like a slightly grayish
color. Whereas if I sample over 0.11
it's closer to black and it's going to
sample like a a color that's closer to
black. So instead of creating a
consistent sampling, why don't we use a
random set of black and white values
like through this noise texture to
adjust the factor here. So now you can
see if I plug in the factor here into
the color ramp factor and the color ramp
color into the base color, you can see
now if I go into rendered mode, we're
definitely we're going to see different
colors. So let's just make that more
pronounced. I'm going to make the black
like a red, like a really light red. And
then I'm going to make this like a
really really dark blue. And you can see
some areas have patches of blue. Now
it's kind of hard to see because
everything is what do you call it? It's
like way too smooth and blurry. So if I
turn up the scale, you're going to see
now you can definitely see some areas
are blue and other areas are red. So if
I go back and do control shift and click
this again, you can see as we adjust the
black and white values, it's going to
sample from this color ramp here random
values of black and white of 0 to 1 from
these colors here and plug it into our
base color. Let's say at this point you
can see it's really black, which means
it's really really close to zero, which
means it's really really close to red
here on this side. So if I go back and
control shiftclick on this, you can see
that corner is very very red. And you
can see the areas that are blue are more
white cuz they're closer to one. So
again, keep your eyes right here. It
should be really, really blue. And
indeed, you can see the blue values
right there. Now, if you want to adjust
how much red and blue it is, what you
can do is actually adjust the slider.
And what this does, it will increase the
amount of reds. And if you do this,
it'll increase the amount of blues. So,
how does that make sense? Well, what we
have right is a noise texture that's
generating random values of 0 and one.
And since this goes from 0 to one, it's
just sampling from here and here and
here and here and here. When you move
your slider from, let's say, this side
to this side, effectively what we're
doing is like any value 0.5 or above is
just going to be this blue color. So
that's exactly why we see so much blue
here because let's say we have 0.8 8. If
the slider was here and we had 0.8, it
would be like a a dark shade of blue,
right? But now what we're effectively
saying is 0.8 is going to be the same
shade of blue of 0.9 1, you know, 0.5 so
on so forth. So all the grayscale values
that are within this range are just
going to share the same exact color. So
that's why we see more blue here. So how
do we how do we invert it then? Well,
you just click the slider and then just
drag it across each other. And you can
see it's going to flip just like that
because the sampling is staying the
same, but we're adjusting where it's
sampling from. So that's also exactly
why when you bring them closer together,
the edges start becoming a lot more
harsher. Right now it's like a now it's
like a distinct pattern. Whereas when
it's far away, you can see it's like
more smoothed out like a cloudy fluffy
vibe. Because right now, if you move
them so close, it's basically, okay,
either take red or take blue. There's no
like in between grayscale values at this
point anymore because they're so close
to each other. So, it's like take red or
take blue. When you spread them out,
it's like, oh, you have all these huge
range of values to sample from. So,
hopefully that made sense. And of
course, you have all these parameters
that you can change around and you can
combine textures. So, you can make
another noise texture for the scale, for
example. And what you're doing is
instead of having a flat scale, you're
creating a noise texture generating
black and white that's also determining
random amounts of scale values. We'll be
making at least one procedural material
together later, but I want to move on
now to the third way of texturing or
adding materials to your scene. So, what
is PBR materials? Well, it's just a
method of, you know, giving materials to
your scene that kind of resembles, you
know, physically accurate things like
when you take your camera and you take a
photo of something, it looks realistic,
right? So, in 3D software, we just call
this PBR. So, what better way to go for
physically based rendering than, you
know, to use actual images as your
information data, right? So, if you go
online and just search for like PBR
materials on like Ambient CG or
Polyhaven, which are two very very
popular sites with I think open source
licenses like some sort of public
license. Um, uh, CC0. Yeah. So, you can
use it for like commercial stuff. Just
make sure to take a look because some
sites, some of their textures have
different licenses from others. Yeah.
Just make sure to check for that. But
what you have here is if you click on
one of these, let's say, let's say I
kind of like this one to put into my
scene. What you can see is that we get a
bunch of images. And these images are
going to determine, you know, how our 3D
software calculates light when
interacting with this. So, let's just
download this at 4K. For here, I'm going
to shift A and search for an image
texture. So, instead of using like a
base color, we're going to use the color
from an image. Again, you know, an image
is just a bunch of colors, right? What
we're seeing here, literally, if you
don't think about the software, is, you
know, hundreds, if not thousands of
pixels on her screen coloring this shade
of thing and then coloring this a
different shade of color and so on so
forth. So, an image is pretty much the
same thing. A digital image, it's just a
bunch of pixels of different colors. So,
if I open So, if I open that oak veneer
image that we downloaded, it's called
diffuse. Diff, short for diffuse, which
just pretty much means color. If I
double click on that, and if I take that
and hook it up into the base color, you
can see, oh my gosh, we have our image
that's now appearing on our 3D surface.
That's awesome. But how do we change
that? Well, if you remember from my
previous video when I talked about image
textures, we need to adjust our UV map.
So UV mapping is taking the idea that
you have a 2D image and you're mapping
it into this 3D virtual simulated space,
right? What we're looking at is a 2D
computer screen. There is no actual 3D
space. It's all mathematical
calculations. So what we need to do is
map from a 2D coordinate system into a
simulated 3D coordinate system. So what
we can do is come over here and go to
the UV editor to adjust our UVs. And
then let's switch to our oak veneer
image, which is what the one that we're
using. Now, if I go into edit mode and
hit A to select everything, you can see
this is our UV map. Basically, what it's
saying is out of this 2D image, take
this area and put it on that specific
face. So, if I select like a face, for
example, you're going to see like, okay,
take all these pixels in this area and
put it on this 3D model. And you can see
when I get close to it, it's really,
really blurry and pixelated. Why does
that make sense? Well, if we take a look
at the entire image texture, which is
4K, we're only using a fraction of those
pixels. So, if I select this like so,
and I scale it up to take more of the
image texture, you can see what we have
is a lot more pixels and it's a covering
a lot more area. Basically, we're saying
take all of this and shove it into this
small little area, which is why it's a
lot more detailed than these other ones,
for example. So ideally when you're
using uh UV mapping, you want to take up
as much of the image texture as
possible, right? And the reason you want
to do that is because you get better
resolution and your textures look nicer.
Now, what about issues like this where
it's on the side and you can see kind of
like the seam and uh if I select the
side, you can see it looks nothing like
it does on over here. So even if I try
scaling it, even if I try moving it,
it's just not going to work. it kind of
just looks really really weird. So what
we can do is unwrap the model better. So
UV mapping is pretty much the idea that
you know how do we map a 2D you know
texture into a 3D space, right? What we
were doing originally is just adjusting
the UV map like the scale, the rotation
and everything. But we can also adjust
how it looks. So, if I come back here
and hit A and U and unwrap and do smart
UV project, it'll kind of use some
algorithms behind the scenes to unwrap
this object for us and try and flatten
it out to lay down on a 2D image
texture. So, if I hit smart UV project
and just hit unwrap, you can see that it
actually did a fairly decent job. So,
now when I click on this face, you can
see it actually has some area and I can
change it around just like that. You'll
also notice okay now from this face and
this face there seems to be like this
sort of edge or this sort of seam we
call it. Now the reason for that is
because they're using two completely
different places of the texture right
you can see this is over here and this
is over here there's no continuous in
the texture. So what if you did So what
if you wanted a continuous texture?
Well, you would just R90 get it in the
same sort of direction and then you
would move this right here. Um, you
know, somewhere super close. And you can
if I just wait, let me just move it one
more meter just like that. Sorry, like
one more pixel. You can see it's
perfectly lined up. And if I go out, it
looks pretty much seamless, right?
Because it's continuing on from the
image, which is clearly continuous here.
They are noticeable close up, but when
you're far away, no one's really going
to tell at all. So, so sometimes your
seams will not matter. So, more
visually, you can imagine that
everywhere that's cut like here, here,
here, here, here, these are all what we
call seams. So, if I quickly add a cube
and I give it the same material, which
is floor plank, by default, a cube will
have a decent unwrap for it. So if you
wanted to mark seams yourself, you can
imagine that we would have a cut on this
edge, a cut on this edge, a cut on this
edge, a cut on that edge, and then you
would need these two as well, which
means you would need to cut out here and
here as well, as well as the top. So you
can slice here, slice, slice, slice,
slice. Right? So let's do that. We would
select this edge, Ctrl + E, and do mark
seam. And you can see that turns red.
Actually, let me just go into solid
view. Ctrl + E, mark seam. So again,
we're just looking at the top. So we're
slicing here, slicing here. And then we
also want to slice here as well as the
edges, right? So kind of just like this,
which is what we said. Now I just do
control E mark seam. And if I go here,
you can see these are going to be our
seams. And now if I hit a U unwrap, and
just do angle based, you can see we get
the same exact unwrap. Now what if we
mark all the edges for example E and
mark all of them as seams. And now if I
do U and unwrap angle based. And now
what we get is three separate faces. So
if I turn up here UV sync selection, I
can just easily select on one of these.
You can see they're all completely
separate. Now this is also the case with
a properly unwrapped cube. You can see I
can just move that individually just
like so. We're just changing the UV map,
right? But with properly marked seams,
what it gives Blender when it unwraps is
more information to determine the
relationship between the faces. For
example, if I come to this corner here,
you can see that it continues on across
the corner like so. Whereas on here,
it's not continuing across the corner.
And you can just tell there's a seam
there. Same with this back side here,
you can see that it doesn't continue at
all. There's no continuous. But if I go
to this one, you can see that it
continues around the corner. And it's
also the same on this side. And you can
see indeed on this side as well, there's
no continuousing on this corner either.
So with a proper unwrap, we get
something quote unquote more realistic
as in we don't see as many of these hard
distinguishments. Like in real life,
yeah, there are definitely cases where
you have like these noticeable
differences in textures, but generally
you don't like that because it looks a
little bit jarring and it looks a little
bit less realistic. So the general rule
of thumb is when you're unwrapping
something, you kind of want to get the
least amount of seams with the most
continuous sort amount of result as well
as with the least amount of distortion.
So a cube is probably not a great
example of that. But if I go and select
this and distort some of the vertices,
for example, you can see this is what we
call distortion. And again, that's
obviously not realistic. So when you're
unwrapping, you want to look out for
distortion and you want to look out for
the number of seams you have. So yeah,
UV unwrapping just like modeling is like
problem solving. You'll have to do a lot
of trial and error and develop your
intuition over time because when you get
more complicated models rather than
just, you know, the primitive objects
here, uh you're going to have to, you
know, try and guess where to mark seams
and things like that. General rule of
thumb is you want to minimize the amount
of seams you have, minimize the amount
of distortion you have. Obviously,
that's just the general rule of thumb.
There's definitely cases where there's
an exception to that. Um, but you know,
for this course, I'm just going to be
sticking with that general rule of
thumb. So, another way to adjust the
texture instead of adjusting the UV map
or the image is to adjust the
relationship between the UV map and the
image. So, the way to do that is search
for a mapping node and plugging in that
mapping node for their vector value
here. Now, it seems to be broken and
that's because this mapping doesn't have
any sort of coordinate system. So, then
we need to add a texture coordinate
node. texture coordinate node. We and we
can give it the UV map that we used as
the texture coordinate. So, we get the
same exact thing. However, now I have a
lot of options here. I can change like
the scale. So, I can do like five. And
you can see, take a look at that. We're
repeating the texture five times now
instead of just one. And you can kind of
see it starts repeating. So, just to
really really drive that point home, if
I turn this to like 200, for example,
you can see that the 4K texture block
block, it's just repeating over and over
again. So, now if I go here, and that's
exactly what this parameter right here
does. It says repeat the texture. This
doesn't adjust the image itself. The
image is still 4K by 4K and it still
looks like this. And it doesn't adjust
the UV map either, right? The UV map is
still here and it looks exactly the
same. What it's adjusting though is the
relationship between the UV map and the
image texture.
So effectively, if I make this go back
to one, for example, and I scale this up
to 200, I'm just going to type 200. You
can see we get the same result. However,
now our UV map is like this really
ginormous thing, right? So you might be
wondering, okay, it seems like it's out
in the oblivion, so where is it getting
all its texture? Well, again, that's
where this comes from. It's called
repeat. So you can imagine that this
texture will just keep on repeating in
this gray area over and over again. And
that's where our UV map is getting the
information. You can see if I change
this to clip for example, only the faces
that are inside this texture are going
to have the material and everything else
is going to be clipped. So if I select
this face here, for example, and I just
move it out of the texture, you can see
that the texture is no longer repeating.
It's just being clipped. So there's
nothing there, which is why it's black.
Okay. So hopefully that makes sense. I'm
going to change that back to repeat. So,
when you're working with PBR materials,
there's kind of three ways to adjust
things. You can adjust the image texture
itself. Of course, you can also adjust
the image texture itself because it's
just color, right? So, you can use the
color data from an image to determine
another set of colors for example. So,
here you can see now everything is black
and white. And what if I change this to
like red for example, and then I'll
change this to like blue. You can see
what we have now are wood planks that
are red and blue. It's taking the
grayscale color data information here
and using it to sample from this color
ramp here. And then like other photo
editing and video editing softwares, you
also have things like the curves. So you
might have seen this before. So if I
plug this in here, control shiftclick,
just click here. And you can see if I
want to, let's say, turn up the reds,
you can see that, you know, it's going
to be a lot more red. If I want to lower
the blues, you know, I can do that as
well. Then you also have, you know, the
other common operations like hue,
saturation, like so.
And you know, when I take out all the
saturation, it goes away, right? You
know, just like your photo editing
software. All right. So, those are kind
of the basics of working with any sort
of image texture. Now, when it comes to
PBR, remember, we get all this other
information here as well. So, what are
all of these? Well, you know, in real
life, if you put your hand around like a
wooden desk or something, you're going
to feel different amounts of roughness
across your surface, and that means
light's going to interact with those
areas at different places, which is why
we also have these other materials again
to tell the 3D software how to calculate
these mathematical calculations more
realistically. Now, instead of shift
duplicating this uh or highlighting all
these and duplicating them multiple
times like so, there's this really
helpful add-on, if you come into edit
preferences, search for node wrangler,
and make sure to check that it's
enabled. And what you can do instead, if
I just get rid of all this is just
select the principal BSDF, control shift
T, navigate to oak textures, select
everything, and just hit principal
texture setup.
And you can see it'll set up everything
for us. It'll give us the nodes that we
need. It'll set up the diffuse into the
base color, the roughness map into the
roughness channel. Here you can also see
that for the color space, we set it as
non-color because it's just because
there is no color information here. It's
a range of zeros and ones determined by
grayscale, right? So if I go to the
roughness map here, you can see it's a
grayscale image. So the areas that are
here are closer to zero, which means
it's going to be less rough and more
shiny. And the areas that are white are
going to be more rough and less shiny.
It's closer to zero, which means the
roughness value at this point of the
image or in our simulated 3D environment
should be a lot more shiny. So if I go
into edit mode and just select the face
where this is and then hit period to
jump there, I guess it's kind of hard to
tell because these are it's not really
close to black at all. So, it's really
really kind of hard to tell from this
specific lighting, but this is supposed
to going to be more shiny than the areas
that are wider. And then again, here you
can see it gives us our mapping node
that we can play around which will
affect all the textures here. So, for
these other ones like displacement,
essentially what we're doing is
displacing the geometry so it's more
realistic, right? Again, if you move
your hand around a wood plank, certain
areas are going to be higher than
others. So, essentially what we're doing
here is displacing it. Now, since we
just have a plank by itself, we're not
really going to see much displacement
here at all. Even if we, you know, crank
up the scale or the midle or whatever.
However, if I duplicate this and bring
it up and I go into Whoops. Let's piece
over by selection. And I go into edit
mode, for example, and just subdivide
this a lot. And then I give it a
displacement modifier like so. And I
create a new texture for it. So, here we
can just create a clouds for example.
You can see it's it's displacing that,
right? And we can change like the
strength of it and how much it's
displacing. But if we don't have, you
know, if I go into edit mode here and
unsubdivide
and unsubdivide and unsubdivide and
unsubdivide again and one last time, you
can see that the displacement barely
does anything. So for us again, it's not
really a big deal because we're so far
away. you know, the minor displacements
of wood planks wouldn't really be
noticeable even if we did have some in
this case. Now, we also have this thing
called ambient occlusion, and basically
it adds like soft shadows where objects
are like close to each other sort of
thing. And that kind of gives a, you
know, a bigger sense of depth and
realism as well. Now, it's not hooked up
automatically because it's not it's not
like a map like anything else. You have
to like mix it with your base color in
order to like change it and so on so
forth. That's a little more advanced, so
I'm not going to be covering that. But
that's kind of what ambient occlusion
is. And what you have, this last thing
here is a normal map. And basically that
just, you know, adjusts like quote
unquote the normal of your surface,
which determines, you know, how lighting
is calculated when hitting that surface.
So this is going to be, it's not going
to be an accurate explanation, but just
for like a more general explanation.
Let's say you have a surface like this
and the normal is pointing this way. And
let's say your light is coming from
here. So this is kind of like your light
source. Based on this normal, your light
source is going to take that factor into
consideration and then sort of, you
know, have some sort of reflection of
angle. However, if you have a normal map
that adjusts the normal in some sort of
way, for example, let's say the normal
is now pointing this way. If your light
is hitting your surface, it might, you
know, now reflect this way. I don't know
if that's accurate or not, but you know,
obviously it's going to depend on your
surface. So, if the light is reflecting
differently based on your normal map
because it's adjusting how the normal is
looking, which affects the vector math
behind the scenes, then your surface
will look different. And that's kind of
what a normal map is doing. So a lot of
time normal maps are used to quote
unquote fake geometry because if you
adjust the lighting or the mathematical
calculation, you can essentially create
things that look like they have geometry
even if there's no actual geometry
there. As in you don't have to add extra
vertices for more detail. The lighting
will kind of do the work for you. So
here's an example from Bruno Simon, one
of his experiments, open source repo.
You can see if I look at the edge here,
it seems like, okay, there's definitely
some sort of insets there. There's
definitely some sort of loop cuts.
There's definitely some sort of extra
geometry there, right? There has to be.
But in reality, there actually isn't.
So, I just downloaded case.gb
by opening it in a new tab. And now,
when I go back into Blender and import
that, you can see that if I go into
wireframe or solid, let me just go into
edit mode. There's actually no geometry
here at all. Even though we visually see
it, there's nothing here. And that is
the power of a normal map. So instead of
adding all that information here, we can
just use a normal map to do that for us.
Now the topology, you might wonder why
does it look so bad? It's because
everything is triangulated for 3GS to
handle, which is another thing that
you'll learn about later down the road,
but it's not really important right now.
So that's kind of like the power of a
normal map.
So just to recap the three ways we
learned to give our stuff some materials
is one just use the base color the
principled BSDF. The second is to use
some procedural materials which we use
mathematical calculations to create
materials and then we have PBR materials
which are image textures that we find
online. Now of course you can combine
methods in the same scene and even
methods with each other right you can
use some procedural elements to you know
affect the base color and so on so
forth. Additionally, there's other
methods that I'm not covering in this
video like texture painting where you
literally create an image texture and
paint on it and then you know wherever
your UV map is since it's just an image
is just mapping there. So, you could
texture paint directly in Blender or you
could like paint in Photoshop and then
upload the image texture into Blender
and just use that. There's other
software out there where you can like
paint on an image texture and if you
have a plugin to Blender, as long as you
save the image in that 3D software, it
will automatically update the image in
Blender as well. That way you can have
like quote unquote real-time updates as
you paint and save. However, for us,
we're just going to be primarily
sticking to either PBR materials that
you find online, base colors, or some
basic procedural materials. So, as we
start applying our materials now and
going around and applying materials,
there's a few things we need to keep in
mind. The first thing is we're going to
have to start applying our modifiers now
and confirming that's actually what we
want. So, if I go for this here, it is a
bevel modifier. Okay, that looks great,
but do I really need that many segments?
So now you can like change it down and
see if it works or not. So here, three
looks the same as four. So maybe we
should just go for three in that case.
And you can also adjust the amount.
You're like, okay, do I really want it
that beveled? And so on so forth. So the
first thing is you're going to have to,
you know, apply all these modifiers. And
that means destructive, which means it
will be difficult to change later when
you go back to it. So, make sure you
really really have something that you
want before you apply your modifiers. Or
again, like we did earlier in the video,
you can duplicate the whole thing, you
know, your objects together and just
move that into the modifiers collection.
Or again, you can come up over here,
file, save incremental, and start from
there. So, I think I said it earlier in
the video, but the first thing we have
to do is apply our scale. And this will
also affect our unwrap as well. So,
apply your scale and make sure nothing
breaks. And it seems like nothing break.
But if something did, then make sure to
fix that. Actually, it does look like
the applying scale affected this, which
means I accidentally forgot to apply my
scale before I applied the modifier or
sorry, added the modifier. So here you
can see Z. If I apply my scale, this is
now messed up. So I can fix this just by
adjusting the thickness of the solidify
modifier back there. Also, you know,
when you're adjusting your things,
again, this is kind of the time to, you
know, make sure that's kind of the model
that you actually want. Additionally,
you might have to add some extra
geometry. Like, let's say you want the
center of this cup to be a different
color. Well, then you would have to go
into edit mode, add two loop cuts here,
and over here, create a new material
called mug, and another one called like
mug inside. Mug inside inside. and you
would assign it to these set of faces
whereas this one would be something
else. You can see we assigned it here
and then this one would be like I don't
know something like that. Now you don't
have to add extra geometry to change the
material at different places on the
mesh. As noted when we did procedural
images or image textures they have
different colors too but for a lot of
cases you will have to add extra
geometry to split it up because it just
makes it easier and you don't have to do
the mathematical calculations here. Like
if you wanted to simulate this same
behavior with Blender nodes, you could
you could do that, but it would take a
lot more time and that's kind of too
in-depth for this video. You know, as
you go around your scene, you know,
keep, you know, apply your modifiers,
make sure it's kind of final. You know,
save backups if you need to. So, the
second thing you have to keep in mind is
starting to join your objects and
getting rid of extra geometry. So, for
example, this cactus right here, these
are three separate objects right now.
But when I want to animate them, I want
to animate it just like this, right? I
don't want it to like animate this in
and then this in. If you do, then you
would leave them separate. But I don't.
I just want to animate this entire thing
just like that. So what I'd have to do
is convert this to a mesh, right? Apply
my modifiers and then join one of them.
So now they're together. However, you
can see that the origin point is right
here. Which means if I animate it like
from a scale of zero to one in like 3GS,
it's going to animate from this starting
point. But that looks kind of awkward.
What if I want it to start from the
bottom? Well, I can hit control period
and that'll bring up this right here.
And I can do GZ and snap it to the
bottom. Because we have face select, I'm
just snapping it to the bottom. And then
I can hit control period just to convert
that. So now the origin point is at the
bottom of the plant. So if I scale from
0 to one, it'll come like that. And that
looks that looks better for what I'm
going for. Now let me undo the join. And
the other issue we have to fix is all
this overlapping right here. We have to
fix that because this place will take up
some sort of place on our UV image.
Because if I go into edit mode, let me
unwrap this real quick. You can see that
all this empty space is taking up pixels
on our image texture. That means other
areas that could be bigger on the image
texture and have higher resolution is
being sacrificed by this area here,
which isn't being seen at all. So, you
could come here and adjust that, right?
And just hide it. But since it's not
being seen, why not just delete it? At
this point, you have to make some sort
of adjustments, right? You can probably
like take some of these and delete these
vertices. And then for these ones, you
can probably just move them slightly. A
little bit of overlap is fine. You don't
have to be a perfectionist here, but you
want to kind of get rid of anything that
is overlapping or that it's wasting
texture space. Like when you're going
for image renders or small scenes like
this, it doesn't really matter. But when
you're going for like animated scenes in
Blender that have a lot of moving parts,
you know, every bit of optimization
counts. And this is kind of like the
same idea when it comes to the browser.
You know, you want to save on
information. That way, your users won't
have to load as long and there might be
less performance issues. You know,
there's this general idea that, you
know, if users have to wait a few
seconds to use your website, they'll
kind of click off. Obviously, the
demographic is a little bit different
for interactive websites, but you know,
that's that's still something to keep in
mind. So, again, this is going to take,
you know, quite a bit of your time. So,
you know, just be patient. Just have
fun. You know, turn on music if that
helps and so on so forth. Again, you
don't have to be a perfectionist about
it. So, same thing with like the bottom
of this here. I don't think I'll ever
need it. So, I can just delete that.
Now, the issue becomes is do in the
future if I want to animate this, will I
ever make it bounce up? If the answer is
I will make it bounce up, well, can my
camera see underneath? And if my camera
is always like this, then I can never
see underneath anyway. So, I'm safe to
delete that face. If my camera can go
here, you know, we're just going to see
through that and it'll look really
awkward. So, when you're deleting faces,
when you're joining objects, fixing
their origin points, you know,
confirming what kind of modifiers you
actually want and the shape that you
want and adding materials. These are all
things to consider and keep in mind, you
know, like just to drive that point
home, it really really depends on what
you need in order to determine how you
want to join your objects. Like let's
say you want to animate all these at the
same time, but when the user clicks on
it, you're only animating these. In
which case, you might join these
together, but then leave these two
separate. What if you want all of them
to go at the same time, but when you
click on it, all three of them go in
different separate ways? Well, in that
case, it's like you would check for the
name and then like make the scale go to
one and then tell GAB to play with
previous or whatever animation method
you're using. Whereas, if you joined all
of them together, you know, it would
just be like, oh, name check if it's
cactus. If it is, set it scale to, you
know, this animation timeline or
whatever it is. Keeping them separate
has more flexibility. But if you don't
need the flexibility, then there's no
reason to keep them separate. I also say
there's this thing called GPU draw calls
which will be reduced the more you join
objects. So that is also a performance
optimization. So let's say for example
this entire scene you're never going to
animate this or you're going to animate
it together like this but no user
interaction. They can't click on
anything doesn't really matter. Then you
can just control J and join everything.
Obviously there's a little bit messed up
things when I join them. But now
everything acts like one single object
and that's a that reduces the amount of
GPU draw cost. Again that's just some
advanced concept but it doesn't really
matter. Just keep in mind what you want
to do for your scene. I can just tell
you from experience that you're probably
likely not going to mess up anything and
the biggest issue will be our texture
rather than, you know, you joining
objects together, which I'll talk about
later in the video. Okay, so before we
start going around and materializing our
scene and adjusting everything, of
course, you kind of want to also play
around with your light at the same time.
So, let's go back to the world and take
a look at some other lighting methods
that we can use. So, by default, it's
just a background, like some sort of
ambient color, right? And you can change
that and adjust it like so. And then we
added this really cool sky texture thing
that comes in with Blender that kind of
looks like a realistic sky. Another
lighting method to use is HDRI. You can
find a lot of great ones for free on
polyhaven.com.
So they're just high dynamic range
images that provide lighting information
that the 3D software uses for their
mathematical calculations. So this looks
really really beautiful. So what what we
can do is download it. I'm going to go
for 4K. 2K might be enough for you. You
know, 8K is generally overkill, but you
know, do with whatever you need to do.
So, in order to use that HDR file, we
need to search for an environment
texture and plug it in like that. Now,
be pink because Blender is telling us,
okay, it doesn't find anything. That's
why by default it's pink. So, we can
navigate to it, right, and open it here.
But again, why search for an environment
texture? Since we have node wrangler
installed, we can just do control T and
it'll automatically add environment
texture to us as well as the mapping and
texture coordinate node for us. So I
open my HDR file and you can see that
now it's lighting up my scene. So if I
hit M to mute this, you can see it's
just going to take the background, but I
can hit M again to reshow it. And then I
can adjust the strength of my HDRI. You
see the shadows are really, really soft
because the light source is so expansive
and large, which is what we did with the
sky texture, right? We increased the
size and it increased the shadow. You
can see as I rotate it, for example,
it's getting darker. Why? Because the
light source is coming from over there
now and there's nothing over there. It's
just a bunch of clouds. So, here's
another one with that I downloaded from
Polyhaven that definitely looks that
definitely has a lot more harsh shadows.
And you can see how realistic that looks
already and we barely even did anything.
So, when lighting your world, these are
generally the two very common methods to
light your world. Use an HDRI or use a
sky texture. Doesn't really matter.
Really, really up to you. Are there
other methods to light the sky?
Absolutely. You can create your own sky
if you wanted to rather than use
blenders, but that's a little more
complicated. And of course, if you don't
want to use world lighting, you can use
the actual built-in lighting objects,
right? Like if you shift A and come here
and search for light, you have these
things like spotlights that act like a
spotlight, right? And you can see I can
change like the power of it. I can
change the color of it and a lot of
other things about it like how wide it
is and so on so forth. Then you also
have other kinds of light. You have like
a sunlight itself that you can use and
you can hit R to like rotate it, you
know, so on so forth. Its position
doesn't matter. So just place it
somewhere that you like. Click on it and
you can see that you know it's going to
adjust that. And of course you can
combine these lighting methods with your
other lighting methods. So here you can
see there's like a slight red glow from
there. And our HDRI is still affecting
that. And our sun is as well. You can
see there's a separate shadow for this
sun and a separate shadow for this thing
right here. You have a lot of options
there. You can play around with the
lights. You know, at this point it's all
about just experimenting what looks nice
for you. you know, change the shape of
things, change, you know, into like
ellipse, for example. What does that do?
So on so forth. Oh, maybe I want some
lighting here or some over here and over
here and so on so forth. So another
really common way to light your scene is
with an emission shader. So if I click
on one of these, for example, let me go
back to object and give it a new
material called name.
In principle BSDF, there's this thing
here called emission. And if I turn up
the emission, you can see it's going to
start emitting light. And then I can
change the color like so. And now it's
like some sort of really really cool
neon glowing thing. Now the downside of
using emission here is that it might
look a little bit off in 3GS without
doing some sort of extra steps. It might
be passable most of the time without
doing extra steps, but sometimes you do
have to use extra steps just to make it
a little bit more realistic. Not always,
but often times you do. So what people
like to do is sometimes they'll add like
a plane in the background. Let's say let
me just go into wireframe. Let's just
say I place like a strip here for
example as uh sy like here. So no one
can actually really see it but it's just
going to be lighting my scene. And if I
go into rendered view just give it a new
material call it light strip.
Come into emission and just make it like
orange or something and turn that up.
You can see we're kind of getting like
that's pretty cool actually. Like that's
a really really cool effect, right? So
if you go to the world and you plug this
in just for some better lighting and
then change this to like 05 for like a
nighttime scene, you can see we're kind
of getting some really cool vibes right
now. So honestly, you know, at this
point, just have fun. Experiment with
different kinds of lights, different
kind of HDRI. Find something that you
like, different emissions. You can also
use an emission node if you want to
rather than the principal BSDF emission.
it'll kind of have a similar effect. Uh,
right. Um, and of course there's also
things you can plug in to change the
emission, uh, you know, like a gradient
or or whatnot, but I'm just going to
stick really really basic for now. But
yeah, just have fun. You know,
experiment with your lighting,
experiment with your materials. Again,
keep in mind the things that I mentioned
earlier when you're applying stuff. I'll
say when you're working with like
emitter objects that are only there for
the lighting and not for the scene
itself, it's generally good practice to
move it to a new collection like
emitters or something. That way you know
that they're not going to be exported.
They're just only there for the or for
the lighting. And typically what you do,
you can't hide it because it'll get rid
of it. What you can do is come into
object object properties and under
visibility you can just turn off camera.
So you can't see it. You can still
select it. You can't see it. Uh but it
will still emit the light. So that's one
way to remove it from the viewport if
you want to while still including the
light. Like if you want to, you can look
up lighting theory at this point and
like look at like threepoint light
system, things like that, you know, how
to get better se lighting in scenes. So
you could totally go that route if you
wanted to, but I highly encourage you
just to have fun and explore what looks
cool rather than dive into the theory
straight off the bat. But if you want to
dive straight out into professional
lighting tips and things like that, then
totally go for it. Another cool trick
for deleting faces quickly or areas
quickly. Let's say I go here. Let me
convert this to a mesh. Make sure my
modifiers are applied and go into local
view. Instead of going into edit mode
and you know like selecting all these
bottom faces, what you can do is shift G
and select similar by area which will
select also the top because it has the
same amount of area. Or what you can do
is selected shift G select similar
normal. And since all the normals for
this are pointing down, it's going to
select all the other things we are in
edit mode with the normal pointing the
same direction. So now I can just hit X
and delete those faces. And you can see
it deleted all those bottom faces for
us. That way we don't have to waste our
time, you know, going into bottom
orthographic and then selecting all them
with box select and then deleting them
or worst case holding shift and
selecting each one of them. Now
definitely, you know, utilize snapping
when you're moving things out of things.
That way it'll just speed up your
workflow as well. Another really handy
trick is to bulk rename things. So you
can see that oh I accidentally select
those. You can see we have a bunch of
sticky notes here and they're all named
like planes. So what we can do instead
of just hitting F2 which will name the
active object we can do Ctrl F2 and this
will bring up this thing called batch
rename. And in batch name out of the
selected objects that we have not the
all the objects just the selected
objects that we have. We can use a
regular expression. You can toggle it on
and off here. Find everything that fits
that regular expression and replace it
with a new name. So here what I'm doing
is anything that starts with plain dot
right plain dot and then you know any
number after it find that and then
replace it with sticky note. So when I
hit okay you can see that everything is
now called sticky note and then it just
automatically increments with the
default blender setting there 01. Now if
you don't like the 0001 now you can do
Ctrl+ F2 again and go back to selected
and then this time you can find 0 and
then replace it with underscore instead.
So if I hit okay now you can have sticky
note_1_2.
I'm sure there's a regular expression
where you don't have to do it a second
time and it'll just automatically
increment in this format. Um but I'm not
aware of it at this specific moment.
Either way, I like this naming
convention better because in 3GS, if you
have like a space, let's say this like
sticky note one, for example, when you
log out this mesh in the GB file, it's
going to have underscores automatically
added to it. So, that's why I just add
underscores here anyway. What about
capitalization? Uh, that doesn't really
have any significance for us. I just
leave it capitalized because Blender
leaves their mesh name capitalized. But
honestly, if you want to leave it lower
case and you prefer that, like totally
go for it. Another really cool tip and
trick that you can use is just holding
control or command and using your middle
mouse button to switch between settings.
Remember when we were changing this, we
would click on it and change it. You can
actually just hold control and use your
middle mouse button and it'll go through
those options for you. That way you
don't have to, you know, open up the
menu every single time. And this works
for everything. So roughness, you can
use your middle mouse button to go up
and down, but when you hold control or
command, you'll just increment by, I
think, 0.1 on the roughness slider. Same
thing here on the extrude, so on so
forth, and so on so forth. So I guess
another I would just generally show you
how I would workflow when I'm quickly
adding materials. I would like select
all the objects that I want to share the
same material. Like let's say these all
share the same material. Then I'll shift
select this, Ctrl L, and link materials.
Then I would go into edit mode and just
hit a U unwrap and smart UV project just
to make sure everything looks good. And
if it doesn't, then I would select one
of these and either duplicate it because
again it's no longer float plank and
then adjust the mapping node or I just
come in here and adjust the UV
accordingly. Like so. Of course, if you
want one of these to be 90 and the other
one to be 180, you can totally do that
as well. Really quick, you can just link
materials, adjust them how you need,
unwrap how you need. I'll say just from
experience, you shouldn't have too much
issues with the basic UV unwrap. But if
you have to, you know, definitely mark
seams and try and go from there when you
unwrap. Also, make sure before you
unwrap to apply your scale. I just have
a habit of always applying my scale.
Even though we already did that, I kind
of do it just in case I accidentally
touch something. It's not a big deal if
you unwrapped with a messed up scale
because you can always just apply your
scale and unwrap again. Okay, so let's
create our first procedural material.
Right now, this is just a flat color
with, you know, a decently high
roughness, and it looks fine. It looks
pretty good, actually. But what if we
want to add a little bit more spice to
this? Well, we could do that with a
color ramp, right? So, if we add a color
ramp here, and let's say we, I don't
know, make it Let's say we just make it
this color right here. And then this,
and this color, we can just click on it
and make it this color, except let's
make it, you know, a little bit blue,
kind of like or purple, kind of like
that. And then I'll hook it up and place
it in here. But again, it's still a flat
color. It's picking a color in between
because it's set at 0.5. You can see as
I go here, it's going to be this color.
And if I go here, it's going to be that
color. What we need is another sort of
texture, right? We used a noise texture
earlier. So now there's also this thing
called a gradient texture. And I'm just
telling you this stuff, but you know,
over time you'll discover the built-in
stuff that you can use to create your
things. So now I can just take the
factory channel of the gradient texture
and plug it in here. But let's preview
it first. You can see this is what the
gradient texture looks like. It goes
from black to white linearly. And you
can see that you have multiple options
here. Again, we can use our control to
go in between them. That changes how the
gradient looks. So everywhere that is
black is going to be this pinkish color.
And everywhere is white is going to be
closer to this purplish bluish color. So
if I take the factor here, plug it in
here, then I control shiftclick
principled BSDF, that's exactly what we
see. All the darker areas or the areas
closer to black are this color whereas
all the areas that are white are closer
to this color. And now we kind of get
some variety already. Now what if we
want to control you know where the
gradient is on the mesh. Well again we
do ctrt with node wrangler and we have a
texture coordinate node and a mapping
node that we can adjust. So now let me
just go back to material preview because
it'll be easier to see. But look what
happens. Uh let's also just preview the
gradient texture here. Look what happens
when I change something like the Y
location. So now we have something like
that. So let's go back into rendered
view real quick and go back to the
principal BSDF. And you can see now over
here is all blue. Wow. How cool is that?
So you you'll also notice this time we
didn't use the UV for the texture
coordinate. We used generated. So as I
cycle through this with control shift
and leftclick, it's like what am I even
looking at? So, if you want to know
that, uh, you can take a look at the
Blender documentation for a little bit
more detail here on the differences
between the texture coordinate system.
This is a little bit getting into the
weeds, so I'm not going to be diving
into here, but for us, you know,
generated works perfectly fine. So, you
know, for now, this is not something you
really have to worry about. Cool. So, we
actually made our first procedural
texture. That's really, really cool.
Okay, but what if we want different
patterns? You know, not just a gradient
texture. What if we want like other
patterns in in in our scene? It doesn't
seem like we really have any more inputs
here to place there, right? So, that's
where this thing comes comes in called a
mix color node. There's a lot of other
sort of mix mix nodes on here, but we're
going for the mix color because we're
working with colors. So, let's select
these. Uh, sorry, this is kind of close
to this one for some reason. If we
duplicate this with shift D and we plug
this in here and we plug this one in
here and then plug this into the base
color, we're not going to see much yet.
So, let's change this to something else
like uh green. And let's change this to
like, I don't know, orange or something
like so. And let's change this Y value a
little bit. And now you can see it's
probably over there. the whiter areas of
this color are mixing to each other with
the lighter areas of this color, which
is why we don't get completely green and
we don't get completely pink. Because
right now what we have is they're mixing
together. So we're seeing 50% of this
color at the grayscale value of that
color specifically and 50% of the color
that's being sampled at that grayscale
value along this. So you can see if I
change this to one, it's going to go for
this one. It's going to take this whole
thing. And if I go for this one, it's
going to go back. If I turn this to
zero, it's going to take 100% of this
color instead. So here you can see, you
can see if it was just this by itself,
which I can just prove right now, it
would look exactly the same. Cool. Okay.
So, let me actually just replace this
with like a noise texture real quick.
That way we kind of have something
easier just to see. So, let me put it in
there. Let me delete this and click this
like here. And uh let's just temporarily
change this to one. Let's make these
colors a little more distinct. So this
green will be extremely green and like
kind of dark. And let's also bring them
up kind of like this. So they're really
really close to each other. So now we
have something that looks really really
funky. So let's change this back to 0.5.
Now in this case we get something but
everything seems to be a little quote
unquote faded and not as realistic. And
why is that? Well, that's because we're
linearly interpolating between two
colors. They're mixing between each
other. If we What if we add colors?
Well, now it becomes even brighter.
Well, you can imagine now what we're
doing is like taking two different
colored flashlights and pointing them in
the same area. No matter what color the
flashlights are, that area is going to
be brighter. So, that's why when adding
colors, we get this brighter effect. So,
typically when we're adding two
different patterns together, what we
actually want to do is multiply. And
this is more realistic to how light is.
So if I go back to mix, you can see it's
a little bright. If I go to multiply,
it's a little more dark. And if I go to
add, it becomes significantly higher. So
if you remember from my previous video
when we talked about colors, there's
different ways to resemble colors,
right? You can go from 0 to 255 or you
can have hexadimal or you can have a
float value between 0 and one. So if you
have a float value of 0ero to one and
like three channels are GB which mix
together to make other colors that means
the higher amount of one you have the
more reds you have in your image. So if
you wanted a completely red image this
would be 1 zero and zero. All right so
let's go back in Blender just to take
out all the noise all the extra stuff
here. And let's just do that right now.
So let's also select one of these. Oh,
by the way, if you want, you can add
like different nodes here as well to
adjust the gradient sort of thing. But
you can also subtract one. So, I'm going
to get rid of one of them. And I'm
literally just going to make this
completely red. And for this one, I'm
going to get rid of one of these. And
I'll just make it completely green. And
I'll make this green like a light green.
So, right now, uh, we're on add. Let me
go back to mix real quick. Right now,
what we're getting is a mix between 50%
of red and 50% of green. So, if I were
to duplicate this, let me just duplicate
this real quick and add another one here
like so. And make this other side one uh
the color of our red. So, let's come
here and just pick the eyropper tool and
pick that red color. You can see right
in the center is the exact same color
that we're getting right here. Some
yellowish orang-ish color, right?
Because what we're doing is we're
linearly interpolating between the two
colors which again are represented using
zeros and ones which is why this factors
between zero and one. So mix is linearly
interpolating between the colors which
again colors are just mathematical
numbers to tell computers how to make
colors pretty much. So if you can
imagine uh we have our red color here
and we have our green color here. So
let's just imagine it's 0 1 0. It's
obviously not but let's just assume it
is. What we're doing as we change the
factory slider in this case is we're
going like let's say we move it like one
nudge then what we get is red would be
like I don't know 0.9 and then green
would become like 0.1 right and then we
move another tiny nudge red would become
0.8 and then green would become 0.2 two.
So this is going to be our final color.
So if we move it halfway center, we
would get 0.5 red, 0.5 green, and that's
why we get the mix that we do. So this
would be our final output color. Now,
how does that change if we do add, for
example, if we do add our colors
together? If we add our colors, why is
this suddenly completely like bright
orange? Let's say again we have our two
colors, our pure red color and our pure
green color. What AD does it linearly
interpolates like the mix one but except
instead of going between two colors it
will take a I don't know vector outcome
and interpolate between your initial one
which is going to be the A channel and
your final output. So since we're doing
an addition operator we're going to be
adding vectors together. And if you
remember from like middle school or high
school to add vectors you take the X the
Y and the Z. In this case the separate
channels RG and B. So 1 + 0 is 1. 0 + 1
is 1. 0 + 0 is 0. So this is the final
vector. So what we're interpolating
between is this vector and our initial
vector which is just red like so. So
imagine if we have 0.5. What we can
expect is 1 comma 0.5 comma 0. Why does
this make sense? Well, we can't linearly
interpolate between 1 and 1 because
they're the same value. Same with 0 and
0. However, from 0 to 1, we have all the
values between 0 and 1 to interpolate.
So, if we change this to 0.6, we can
imagine that this would also be 0.6. 1
comma 0.6 comma 0. So, here you can see
well, this uses between 0 and 255, but I
just scaled it up. So, this is 1, right?
This is 255 out of 255, which is 1. And
then this is about 0.5 of 225, which is
127.5, but it just rounded up. And you
can see what we get is we get orange,
which is exactly what we see here. All
right. So now what if we change from add
to multiply? Why is it red at 0.5? Why
is it our original color at zero? And
why at one is it completely black? Well,
if we do this again, but this time we
multiply vectors. So here's our red
color. Here's our green color. This time
we're multiplying vectors. Same thing
like addition, we take their separate
components. So 1 * 0 is 0. 0 * 1 is 0. 0
* 0 is also 0. So this is our resulting
vector which means we're going from this
our red vector and linearly
interpolating to 0 comma 0 comma 0. So
that means when we move our factor
slider to 0.9 what we're doing is going
from one getting closer to zero. So we
can expect our outcome to be 0.1
comma 0 comma 0. And since this is so
close to black, that's why we're getting
closer and closer to black until we
increase our factor to one. And then of
course, if our factor is zero, that
means we're at the our starting point,
our starting vector right here. So you
can see that's exactly why when we go
here, it's completely red, our original
color. And when we go here, it's
completely black. Okay. So what if we
multiply the same color by each other?
Then we should expect no interpolation
at all, right? Because 1 comma 0 comma 0
* 1 comma 0 comma 0 is just 1 comma 0
comma 0. There's no value between our
starting vector 1 and 1, 0 and 0 0 and 0
to interpolate between. So no matter
where we adjust our factor slider, it
should stay the same exact color. So I
can prove that by duplicating this and
hooking it up into the factory slider
and adjusting the factory slider. Now
what we do see is that it gets slightly
darker. So how does this make sense?
Well, if I click on this, it's not
actually completely red. You can see
there's a little bit of blue and 0.776
of red. There's no green, though. What
that means is that our starting color is
0.7. I completely forgot already. And
then this was like 0.01.
So, our starting vector multiplied by
our ending vector, which is just happens
to be the same thing, right? 0.01. Well,
when you multiply decimals together or
fractions together, you get something
even smaller, right? So 0 I don't know,
this is probably around like 58 or
something. So you get 0.58. I don't know
if that's accurate. Then 0 * 0 is 0. And
then this you just add two zeros. So 01.
So again, this is closer to 0, which is
closer to black, the black color, right?
Anyway, to really drive that point home,
I can just show you if I change this to
one and change this to zero. And same
here, I change this to one and change
this to zero. And now I adjust my factor
slider. You can see there's absolutely
no difference on the color whatsoever.
Obviously, there's a lot of other
blending modes and things to do here,
which you can find on the Blender
documentation, which isn't great
specifically on explaining these from
what I remember. But I do remember there
was a YouTuber that went into detail on
every single node and the math behind
each node. So, if you really want to get
into the nitty-gritty details, I'll make
sure to link that if I remember it. It
was like a really small video and it
wasn't popular, so I kind of forgot
about it, but uh it's definitely
something that I wanted to watch myself.
I think for most 3D artists, it's kind
of a combination between intuition and
mathematics knowledge. Obviously, some
3D artists are going to be more math
heavy than others, but to me, I kind of
want to know the math behind things
because these concepts are transferring
into other software like Photoshop, and
it also transfers intuitively to when
you're programming with shaders and
things like that as well. I'm generally
more on the math heavy side or at least
trying to become more math heavy. You
don't you don't really have to be good
at math to be a 3D artist. you know, you
can stick with the conventional
texturing methods and developing your
intuition over time. Watching other 3D
artists make their materials kind of
helps build you a nice intuition and you
don't really have to know the math
behind things. So, for us, you know, I
didn't really have to explain all the
vector math at all and we could have
probably got a good result just you
using my first explanation about mixing
and adding and that sort of stuff, but I
kind of just wanted to talk about a
little bit about the math behind the
scenes there. So why don't we just have
some fun and explore another procedural
material. So if I do search for our mix
color node like we had earlier. Right
now it's just going to be between these
two gray values. So let's add a color
ramp node like so. And let's just take
this right here and let's just sample it
from our base color. And I'm just going
to get rid of this for now. And then we
can just hook it up here. And then hook
this up just like that. Cool. So we're
mixing between this pink and this right
here. If I hit mute, you can see it's
going to go back to that original paint
color. Cool. Let's change this mix to
multiply, which we discussed earlier.
And let's duplicate this color ramp. But
let's add another color here. And maybe
let's change this to some arbitrarily
completely different color like orange
or brown. And then this one can be like,
I don't know, green or yellow or
something like that. And then let's just
plug that in there. So again, you know,
if you wanted to, you could come to
these color nodes, open them up, look at
the values, and do the multip
multiplication calculation. And then you
can see what values this would be
interpolating between. So if you want
to, you can totally do that. Now, what
if I want to, you know, have some sort
of pattern, not just flat color? Well,
we know how to do that, right? We can
add like something like a noise texture.
And there's other textures that you can
explore as well. take that pl plug it in
here. It's going to be randomly sampling
from here. So, if I hit control shift t,
you can see this is what we're getting.
Now, you might be saying, okay, this
looks really cool, right? But how come
it's only, you know, how come it's only
very very gray, right? There's no really
solid blacks or solid whites. How do I
fix that? How do I change that? Well,
you actually can change that with a
color ramp node. Again, remember we have
these black and white grayscale values
that are sampling between 0 and one from
this. So, what if we sample from here
first and based on this sample size,
we're resampling to this color ramp
node. So, if I plug it in here and let
me mute this, you can see nothing
changes. But watch what happens when I
increase the blacks. You can see there's
now going to be an increasing amount of
black places until, you know, it hits
100%. Okay, so I'm going to put this at
like 0.2. two and I reset this one. And
then I'm going to put this at like 0.8.
So we know that the noise texture here
is generating values between 0 and 1. I
think when we previewed it, it's likely
not 0 to 1. It's probably like 0.2 to
like 0.6 or something like that. But
anyway, just assume that it's 0 to one
because I think technically it is random
values between 0 and one. These random
values kind of follow a specific formula
which we know as a noise texture. So
assume it generates a value of 0.9
without this color ramp node in the
picture. We would just come over here,
right? And then pick the color at 0.9.
So whatever color this is of that
grayscale value of 0.9, it's going to
show this color on on that object. Now
what happens with this color ramp in the
mix? Well, let's say it generates 0.9.
0.9 is now going to go here. And what we
get is completely white because this is
completely white. So it's just saying
all the values above 0.8 just make it
white. So what it returns is a value of
one and then we take that value of one
and then we sample at this value of one.
If the noise texture generates 0.9, what
we would expect is this color. But now
that we add this color ramp node and
then move this down here, what we get is
an output of one and in this factor that
means we get this color showing up at
that model. So that's pretty cool and
that's exactly why we get the effect
that we do. So here you can see I'm
either sampling between this color or
this color. And then here I'm
determining how much it is. So if you
think about it, this is essentially
controlling, you know, how smooth the
blend is, right? So you have either this
color or either this color, right? As I
bring them closer, it's like this color
or this color like I talked about
earlier. And here it's determining how
much of each color you have, right? So
if I increase this, you can see it's
going to increase that. If you I
increase this, it's going to increase
the other color. However, you know,
again, if I leave this really really
spread out, it's going to be really
smooth interpolation. But here again, if
I increase this, it's going to increase
one that color. If I increase this, it's
going to increase this other color here.
So basically, you have one that's
determining how much amount of color you
have in one or the other. And then you
have another one that's determining how
smooth and harsh harsh the blend is.
Okay. So, let's go back to our principal
BSDF and let's see if we can see
something by probably increasing the
colors a little bit and probably uh
increasing the scale a little bit. And
now you can see we can start seeing
something. So, we already start seeing
something, but let's just adjust the
scale even more. Let's make it really
big. And now we can have like this sort
of wall texture pattern here. And it
looks a little bit more visually
interesting than just a flat color. And
then you have all these other options
that you can play with like distortion.
You know, you can play around with the
scale. What happens if the scale is like
this, for example? It almost looks like
some sort of mystical dungeon dragon
sort of thing, right? And now, of
course, what you can also do is use your
information from your color ramp to
determine how rough it is at certain
areas. So, if I take this color and plug
it into the roughness, everywhere that's
going to be more black is going to be
less rough, and everywhere that's more
white is going to be more rough. So, you
can see if I preview this, take a look
at the black areas. They're going to be
more shiny than the rough areas. So, if
I go back here and principal BSDF, you
can see that this black area, these
black areas are reflecting the light.
Really, really simple. whereas all the
whiter areas are a lot more rough and
not as reflective. So you kind of
already get a pretty cool effect here.
Now what if you want to invert it? You
know what if you want the white areas to
be shiny and the black areas to be
rough? Well, you can do that, right? You
can just duplicate the color ramp node
and place it here again. And to invert
it, you just do this, right?
You just flip it. Now you can see all
the white areas are really shiny and all
the black areas are really rough. Well,
what if you want to increase the amount
of shiny areas? Well, you would just
increase the black values, right? Like
so. And now you can see that the
majority of the model is really, really
shiny and glossy. Yeah. So, the point
that I'm trying to make is you can just
play around with things and honestly
just have fun. And you might actually
create some really cool things that you
never knew how to create before. And you
might actually save it to use later,
which is really, really awesome. Like
here, you can see I kind of already have
like a pinkish wall color, which is
looking pretty sweet here. And all it
was is some random noise texture I
generated, some random color ramp I
moved and some random colors that I
chose. Over time, you know, as you
experiment, as you have fun, you're
going to develop your intuition. Even if
you don't understand the math behind it,
you'll develop your intuition on how to
create cool stuff. So, I encourage you
just to take the time to like shift a
search, search for like textures, plug
in random stuff like, okay, wave
texture, that looks pretty cool. But
what does that look like if I use this
instead? What if I control shift? What
does that look like? Oh, it kind of
looks like that. That's pretty cool. And
now you can see we kind of have like a
like a more cozy house sort of vibe. And
then of course we can do the same thing
for the roughness here. And you can see
all the wider areas are more reflective
than the other ones. What if I want to,
you know, take the noise texture, its
factor, and change the distortion of
those lines based on the noise. What if
I want to change its scale based on the
noise? What are we getting there? Let me
control shift. Wow, now that looks
really, really crazy. What if I add What
if I get rid of these and hit CtrlT with
no wrangler and adjust the rotation of
this texture? Wow. What about the Z
direction? What about the scale? Now,
let me go back to my principal BSDF.
What does that do? Wow, it looks like a
bunch of lines patterns. And now you can
see that wow, we only have one face
here, but it looks like we have a
striped pattern here. I really encourage
you just to have fun and explore things.
And when you're ready to go online and
search for other procedural tutorials
out there, because there's a lot of them
out there, I do encourage you to have
some fun first. Okay, so let's create
our first procedural material together
that I'm actually going to be using for
this project. And it'll be a wall
texture. Although we're creating a room,
I kind of also want to go for a wall. So
I was looking up random images of old
agent houses. And just by observing it,
you know, like any other big problem,
you want to take your large problem,
which in this case is creating a wall
texture, and then break it down into its
smaller parts. So just by observing it,
we kind of see some cracks here. And I
guess the image isn't that good, but
there's definitely some cracks here that
you can see, similar with over here.
And at the bottom here, it's generally a
little more darker and kind of like
fades up and gets a little bit more
clear uh you know in the center here.
And that makes sense because a lot of
objects are smaller like this wheel or
whatever this thing here and it's going
to like hit the wall and scrap off
paint. There might be flooding. People
might accidentally kick the side. You
know, people might kick up dirt on the
side and so on so forth. So, it kind of
makes sense that the bottom would be a
little bit darker. So, we kind of have
three areas. We need some sort of noise
texture for the cracks. And then we need
some sort of like gradient texture where
the bottom is darker. And then of course
we need our base color. So I encourage
you to pause the video and try and give
yourself some time to figure out how to
make the room texture with the blended
noise texture with the bottom to be a
little bit darker and then when you try
come back to the video. Okay. So the
first thing we need is definitely a
color ramp node because that's how we
get multiple colors, right? So let's do
color ramp. And for this color, we can
just arbitrarily send it to here. And
for this color, let's just set it at
something like purple. And then let's
add one more in the center. And let's
just make that like bluish. And let's
just plug in the color for this color.
Now again, we're just sampling from the
center right here. Which is why we only
see a flat solid color. So if we want to
make random samples at different
grayscale values between 0 and one,
right? We can use a texture that's based
on some mathematical formula that
someone developed. So again, if you
search texture, you have a lot of
different kinds of textures. We want a
gradient texture. So let's search for a
gradient texture. And let's just plug it
in this right here. Again, you can
preview it just like this. And you can
see this is what the gradient texture
looks like. Now, just to help visualize
this a little bit easier, I'm going to
go to material preview. And I'm also
just going to add a cube and link the
material just so we have the same
material here. And you can see it's more
visually clear what's happening. Now,
you might be saying now like, ""Andrew,
we did something really cool, but how
does that really help me at all? I don't
understand what's happening and how you
figured that out."" So, let's take a
brief look at the mathematics of what's
happening behind the scenes because at
the end of the day, everything is a
little bit about math. By default, this
gradient texture, it needs to know how
to position itself along your object.
So, in order to do that, we use
directional vectors. So, you probably
remember from like middle school or high
school when we were working with vectors
and trigonometry and linear algebra and
that kind of stuff. By default, this
gradient texture is using a vector
that's pointing in the x-axis direction.
So, let me just create that real quick.
I'm going to shift duplicate right click
cancel p by selection. Then I'm going to
right click, set origin, origin to
geometry, go into edit mode, extrude
this out. E, right click, cancel, scale
it up. E, and then just Well, that's
like a really large vector, but anyway.
So you can imagine by default our
directional vector is 1 comma 0 comma 0.
When you normalize vectors you pretty
much just get a direction. We're
interpolating between the direction. So
0 2 1, right? Which is exactly why
across our cube here we're getting zero.
We're sampling zero here. And then we're
linearly interpolating all the samples
to one. And then that's why we see this
color over here. Cool. So what if we
wanted it from to go from bottom to top
like we said we did. Well, again, we can
do CtrlT with node wrangler for a
mapping node. And we can rotate it along
the Y-axis 90°. And now you can see what
happens. It goes from top to bottom. So
when we rotate it 90° along the Y-axis,
just like here, R Y. And I'll do 90.
Take a look. Our directional vector is
now pointing from the bottom to the top.
So now that it's pointing from the
bottom to the top, it essentially shares
the same exact directional vector as a
vector that's pointing up in the Z-axis
direction. So now we're linearly
interpolating between 0 and one in the
Z-axis. And that's why this is happening
here. So now this is the time to talk
about texture coordinate systems. So for
generated objects, it's going to be
based on the object's local space, which
means essentially take into your
object's rotation to determine where it
starts. That's exactly why on this
object here, the bottom quote unquote
bottom is this color and the quote
unquote top and the left on this side is
quote unquote this color. Actually,
let's make these a little more distinct
here. Again, if I rotate along the
Y-axis, if I move it like this, you're
like, ""Oh, that's clearly the bottom.""
But now that it's like this, it's like,
""Oh, that's clearly on the right side,
right? Wasn't it just at the bottom?""
So, in order to quote unquote fix this
or adjust it, we can do control A and
apply a rotation. And now you can see it
follows the same exact pattern as this
one right here. Okay. So, let's revisit
the Blender documentation and take a
look at what generated coordinates do.
So, it says automatically generate
texture coordinates based on the
bounding box of the surface as a range
from 0.0 0 to 1.0. So what is a bounding
box? I mean we were you doing it when we
were holding different items and scaling
it like so. You know what is a bounding
box? Well, you can imagine a bounding
box is like if you drew a box around
your object, what would it look like? So
for for this thing right here, it
doesn't look like a box, but if you were
to draw a box around it, it would
definitely look like a box. Same thing
with here. If I move this over here and
I scale this in, you can imagine that if
we drew a box, it would be this length
width uh you know up to to the width of
this over here. Come over here. Come
over here, you know, over here. So if I
just draw that real quick. So from top
view, the bounding box of selecting this
would kind of look like this. So
selecting this and this object would
kind of look like that, right? So
obviously it would start from down here
but you know just like length and width
wise that's kind of what it would look
like. The bounding box you can just
imagine it goes to this height and it
goes to the bottom height there. So
exact. So when you select one object
then uh since this is a box well it's
just the bounding box is going to look
the same as this cube itself. We know
that an object is made up of a bunch of
points. Like we know there's vertices
and we also call these points but like
this entire face every single thing you
see that makes up this face has a point
because if there's no point on on this
3D surface then there would be like a
hole or something cuz we need to take
into that mathematical calculation. So
we can imagine generated let's just
assume this right here is the front of
the cube. That means we can say this
corner is 0 comma 0 comma 0. This right
corner would be comma 1 comma 0 comma 0.
Right? This corner would be 0 comma 1
comma 0, right? It's in the positive y-
axis as you can see up here. And then
the one that we can't see back here, we
can just say that's going to be 1 comma
1 comma 0. Now, all points in 3D space
are actually technically vectors. This
case from the object's local space
origin point. Since we're using
generated coordinates, the origin is
going to start at one of the corners. So
that means at this point here, we
technically have a vector like this.
Same thing with like a center piece over
here. We can say that's probably 0.5 in
the x 0.5x 0 0 in the y- ais direction
and 0.5 in the z direction. So we would
have like a vector like this. Now the
reason we distinguish between points and
vectors is because vectors are typically
associated with like magnitude or like
some sort of direction or velocity and
things like that. Whereas points are
usually just like absolute values that
you have in space. So even though points
are technically vectors, we still
conceptually distinguish between points
and vectors. Okay. So now that we know
that our object is a bunch of points in
3D space, which ultimately determines,
you know, the physical pixels on our
screen, how to color something, how do
we take into consideration these vectors
given that we have a directional vector
for our gradient? Well, if you remember
from probably middle school or high
school, you've dealt with this thing
called the dot productduct before. And
it basically tells us you know how how
similar are two vectors in this case
against Khan Academy is how much two
vectors point in the same direction. So
the dotproduct is actually exactly what
Blender is doing behind the scenes. We
have this directional vector and then
these together we have our coordinate
system or a point in 3D space that is
also a vector that is taking the dot
product times our gradient textures
directional vector. So there's multiple
formulas to calculate the dot
productduct between two vectors. So I'll
show you the most two common ways like
which which is this which you saw on
Khan Academy and then also like this a
really common way of doing it. Here you
can see these two symbols means the
magnitude of a and the magnitude of b.
In order to calculate the magnitude of a
vector we square all its values. So
0.5^2 + 0 2 + 0.5^ squ and technically
these should be in parenthesis. Oh well
it doesn't really matter. And then we
take the square root of that whole
thing. So if you remember this is the
magnitude but it's also just technically
the distance formula if you want to find
the distance between two points. So if
we do this mathematical calculation is
we get 0.25 here 0.25 0.25. So add 0.25
plus 0.25 you get the of 0.5 which
equals about.707.
Now the magnitude of 0 comma 0 comma 1
it would just be 0^ 2 + 0 2 which is 0 +
1^ 2 which is 1. So it's the square root
of 1 which just equals 1. So we multiply
this result by 1. So it just be 0.70
right? And now like the formula says we
take the cosine between the two vectors.
So since our directional vector is
completely up then then the value of
theta or the angle between these two is
just 45° right? And the cosine of 45°
surprisingly is this exact value right
here. And multiplying this value by the
same exact value ends up getting 0.5.
Now, why does that make sense? Well,
we're taking the square root of 0.5,
which is this. We're multiplying it by
1, so it's just the same thing. And then
it just so happens that the cosine of
45° is also the square root of 0.5. So,
in the end, we end up getting 0.5. And I
can show you right here on this
calculator, the cosine of 45° * the
roo of 0.5 is just 0.5. So this
resulting value 0.5 is going to be the
quote unquote grayscale value to sample
from our color ramp at this point in
space on our mesh, which is exactly why
right in the center right here we have
this color. Now the other way to
calculate the dot product might be
easier here. So if we look at here, you
basically just take the values, multiply
them by together, x * x, y * y, z * z,
and then add all the resulting values.
So let's do that. We did multiplication
earlier. 0.5 * 0 is going to be 0. 0 * 0
is 0. So add these together. And then
0.5 * 1 is going to be 0.5. So what is
our result? What is our result? Well,
our result is 0.5, which is the same
thing that we get here. And of course
the same value that we're going to be
sampling from our color ramp here. So
you can confirm this with any point
along our generated texture coordinate
system taking the dot product to our
gradient directional vector. Like for
example this entire bottom why is it you
know the value of zero? Why is it
sampling here? If you take a look
everything in the z direction which is
our directional vector is zero and
everything in our directional vector in
the x and y is completely zero. So the
result will always be 0 comma 0 comma 0.
So if 0 0 is always the resulting
formula, then we get 0 plus 0 plus 0.
And what is that? Well, it's just 0,
right? So that's why the entire bottom
is the zero color here. Okay? So now we
know how the gradient texture is
working. So even if I have something
like this, why does it show exactly what
we kind of expect still? We can
visualize that there's some sort of
bounding box here for our generated
coordinate system, right? So, it's kind
of like this
around our object. Okay. So, let's take
a look at this. Why is this a completely
different shape from a cube, but it's
still working properly? Well, again,
let's just assume that this corner is 0
comma 0 comma 0. Well, let's take a
place like here. Now, we can say that's
probably like 0.5
in the x direction, right? We're looking
at the x direction here as slight angle.
And then in the z direction, it's going
to be 0.5. And then it's not completely
to the end of the bounding box. It's a
little bit in between, right? Because we
have that little bit of thickness. So
that would be like 0.9 or 0.8 or
something like that. And then we have
our directional vector again, which is 0
comma 0 comma 1. So look what happens
again if we multiply 0 0 + 0 0.5. In
this case, the only thing that actually
matters is the zcoordinate of that point
in 3D space. So if I create a curve real
quick uh just to simulate our you know
our our vector and let me just shift
right click shift s selection to cursor
and uh let me just delete these
vertices. So even though we have a
vector that looks like this right the
only thing that matters at the end of
the day when we do our dotproduct is the
zcoordinate all the the x coordinate and
the y coordinate didn't actually affect
the mathematical calculation at all. So
we still get that blue color right here.
So again, you know, if we want to make a
easier distinguishment, we can just
change this, right? Which I think I
accidentally did when I was recording
the last 5 minutes, but oh well. All the
grayscale values that gradient texture
is generating between 0.441 just to use
this color rather than a linearly
interpolated version. You actually want
it constant. Rather than keeping them
close together, you can just come over
here and change the interpolation mode
to constant. And look what happens. we
get that stripe pattern just like when I
was talking about adding loop cuts for
this mug to add that stuff. Well, now we
know how to make something striped just
like this. Of course, we would just take
this color, right? Copy the hex value
here and place it for this color right
here
like so. And then we have something
striped and then we can just adjust the
sliders here to determine our stripe for
our mug texture. Or of course,
additionally, we have this mapping node
and you can adjust it like so. I was
planning to go into the math behind that
one as well, but I feel like it would
take really, really long and this video
would go on for hours if I explained
every single mathematical thing behind
the nodes. Now, remember, we want the
top to be lighter than the bottom. So,
I'm going to get rid of the center one,
and I'm just going to take this value
and just make it a little bit darker.
And voila, part one of our material is
completely done. Just like that, we have
a darker bottom and we have a lighter
top. Now, over time, you'll find out
that there are multiple ways to do the
same thing because at the end of the
day, all these nodes are just math
behind the scenes. So, you could do some
really complicated node setup and
actually have the same result as someone
that has a lot less nodes than you do.
Over time, you know, you'll get better
at developing intuition and kind of just
like knowing what's available to you.
So, I'll just give a short example for
this one. Instead of using the gradient
texture node, there's this other node
called separate XYZ. And if I go to the
Blender documentation here, you can see
that it splits a vector into its
individual components. So, we know that
the generated coordinis
based on the object's bounding box
center. Why don't we take the generated
coordinate system, use that as an input,
and then we only care about the Z
because we're going from bottom to top.
So, we can just use that Z and plug it
in the factor and take a look at what we
get. We literally get the same exact
thing whether I use the gradient texture
here or the separate XYZ. So, in this
case, there's actually no dot product
calculation at all. We're just taking
the directional vector directly 0 to 1
and sampling those values. And you can
also see here that I don't have a
mapping node. I could add a mapping node
if I wanted to. Let me duplicate and put
it here. But now it's messed up because
we rotated 90 degrees. We actually don't
need to rotate it at all. You might also
be wondering, okay, if this is quote
unquote, like you said, better, Andrew,
then why does this even exist in the
first place? Well, for our use case,
this is quote unquote better just
because there's less setup and things to
change, less moving parts, less
mathematical calculations, and you kind
of just intuitively understand it a
little bit better. Maybe not because I
went into detail here but you know over
time this will become easier to
understand than this if that makes any
sense. Now there are a lot of use cases
where you know taking this approach and
the flexibility of this approach is
necessary compared to using separate XYZ
node for us yes quote unquote this is
better but does it really matter at the
end of the day? No it doesn't really
matter. No it's just about getting a
result and you know developing your
intuition on how to get a result. Part
one of two of our texture is done. So
let me get rid of this. And now what we
want is a noise texture. So how do we do
that? Well, we're going to create a
noise texture. We're going to create a
color ramp to sample from. Like so. Plug
the factor over here. And to mix the
colors, we're going to use a mix color
node. Drop it in here. And we're going
to change it to multiply. Then I'm going
to take this color and place it in here.
And now you can see we have that noise
as well as the darker gradient here. So
of course we can always preview the
noise texture just to see what that's
generating. What kind of values? Maybe
we can make it a little bit bigger. And
then we can control shiftclick the color
ramp just to see the color itself. So
maybe we want to make this a little bit
brownish and this to be I don't know
maybe like a pinkish too but like a
lighter pink. Maybe let's increase the
intensity about this just a little bit
like so. And let's go back to principal
BSDF. Let's go to render view and take a
look. We have a darker bottom. We've got
some noise around here. Maybe we can
increase the darker spots a little bit
more. So we got a little bit of grungy
noise dirt around our walls. All right.
So, we kind of have our gradient texture
from darker to lighter. And then we have
our noise texture, which is like rugged
dirt and wear and tear. So, the last
thing we need are cracks on our surface.
So, how do we do cracks on our surface?
Well, we could create another multiply
thing, create another toys texture, and
then make it a little bit darker and
then probably stretch it so it looks
like cracks or, you know, like wavy
lines and so on so forth. And that would
be okay. Whatever style you're going
for, that actually might be better than
what I'm about to show you. But the way
I'm going to be doing it is plugging a
noise texture into this normal output
right here. If you remember earlier in
the video, we talked about how people
often use normals to quote unquote fake
geometry. And that's exactly what we're
going to be doing. So you'll notice that
it's a purple input, which means it
takes a different kind of input. So we
have to use a bump node. So if you
search for a bump node and plug it in
the normal, just like that. Now
nothing's going to change because
there's no height information put into
this bump node at all. What if we add a
color ramp to that? So let's add a color
ramp. Let's plug the color data, the
grayscale value of the color data into
the height values. And then let's add a
new texture here called a vori texture,
which is just another formula that
someone made up. So if you look up, you
know, vori texture online or like vori
noise, you'll get you'll see different
formulas for different kinds of popular
noises that are often adapted and reused
for different scenarios. Again, you
know, these are just mathematical
formulas that someone came up with. And
let's take our vinary texture. its color
data into the color ramp factor. So, and
voila, just like that, we get cracks
along the surface and we didn't add any
extra geometry for these cracks
whatsoever. So, if I preview the verary
texture color information, you can see
that we have a bunch of random different
colors. So when I take that color
information and use it to sample with
the color ramp, it's converting it to
grayscale and sampling from my grayscale
color ramp, which is determining the
height or quote unquote our, you know,
kind of cracked or like depth of our
quote unquote cracks. So if I preview
the color ramp, you can see, yeah, zero
and ones uh for the height information.
So basically what's happening here is
that the distinguishment between the two
colors, the borders is going to
determine the intensity of how big that
crack appears or how deep the crack
appears. So if I go back here into the
principal BSDF, notice that from here to
here, there's a very very solid looking
crack here. Whereas over here on there,
the it doesn't look like it's as deep of
a crack. And why is that? Well, if I go
to the color ramp, you can see that the
shade of gray here is very close to the
shade of gray here. Whereas over here,
the shade of gray is very distinguished
between these two. Okay, so now you
might be wondering, okay, how do we, you
know, make how do we get fewer cracks?
Well, we can just take our color rep
node, right? And just bring up the
blacks.
And you can see as I preview my thing,
all the blacker areas, the less
distinguished ones are not going to have
that many cracks. You can see the cracks
are here because there's a clear
distinguish distinguishment between
these grayscale values. Whereas in the
black areas, there's very, very few
cracks, if any at all. Okay. So, what if
I want to make more cracks? Well, I
could probably increase the amount of
scale here on the vinary texture. And
now you can see we increase the amount
of cracks like that. What if we want to
increase it in another direction or
another way? Well, again, we have our
mapping node, right? So, we can do
CtrlT. Let's reset the scale to five. I
think that was the default. And look
what happens when I adjust the scale and
the X.
So, think about what's happening here.
It's taking our generator cord system 0
to one and it's increasing scale of our
entire texture. This is just adjusting
you know the scale within its own
mathematical calculations. Whereas this
is adjusting the scale of the entire
vinary texture along the generated axis.
So that means if you want more you know
of these in the Z-axis well then you
just increase the scale on Z right cool.
And now you get like this sort of
pattern right? However for this one you
know when you're adjusting the scale
it's just adjusting the you know the
cracks rather than the amount. Now of
course you know you can change things
like the location as well. So, so you
can take a look at this this set of
crack here. If I move it in the X
direction, you can see we're adjusting
the location of it. Now, you might be
asking, you know, why when I move in the
positive X on this mapping node, it's
going in the negative X direction and
why when I move it on the Z direction in
the positive, it's going down. How does
that make any sense? Well, I was going
to explain that in this video, but I
feel like you can figure that out on
your own. And if you have any questions,
you know, feel free to reach out to me.
Just to recap, this is controlling the
entire texture. The texture is just
controlling its own mathematical
formula. So if you want more noise
patterns, of course, you can just
duplicate this. Come over here. Create
another multiply. Plug it in here. Plug
it in here. This time maybe we can make
our noise texture really, really small
like this. Let's make this color like, I
don't know, like red or something. Let's
make this color like bluish. And let's
go back to our principal BSDF. And now
you can see that we have a really really
small noise. All right. So just to recap
what we have, I kind of just moved
things around a little bit. But you can
also join them together to create a
frame. So if I do Ctrl + J, you can see
it'll create a frame that you can click
and drag together. So what we have here
is our dirt bottom gradient, which I'll
also put for my label here, which is
technically also the base color, but
whatever. And then we have a larger
noise. So we can probably Ctrl + J and
just call it large noise for dirt. And
then over here we have smaller
smaller wall texture for plaster like
thingy bobber. And I'll just copy that
into label as well. And then over here
we have wall cracks. Ctrl J.
Wall cracks. Just like that. At any
point if you want to adjust the wall
cracks you come here. If you want to
adjust the small wall texture, you can
come over here, adjust the larger noise
to appear like dirt, you can adjust
here. If you want to adjust the bottom
gradient, you can come over here and
adjust that. So, I just want to say
congratulations. You created your first
quote unquote professional level
procedural material and we only covered
the foundations and basics of these
shader nodes so far. Just with these
foundations, you can create so many
different kinds of textures and explore
so many different routes from here. like
you can use another noise texture to
adjust the scale of this noise texture
and so on so forth and you kind of
understand intuitively even though we
haven't done it yet what that actually
does. Now the other really really cool
thing is we actually understand the math
behind everything that we're using on
these nodes and if we pick a random
point on our object we can go through
the mathematical calculations to find
out the resulting color at that point in
in our 3D space on our object. So
hopefully by covering these foundations
in this section when you explore your
own materials, you have kind of a
starting point to explore. And hopefully
also when you go and explore more
complicated procedural materials and
procedural material tutorials, you kind
of have like a baseline understanding of
how to follow things and what people are
actually doing in those tutorials. So
I'm going to hit control spacebar. By
the way, I'm using control spacebar just
to maximize my scenes like that. So if
you just hover over something and hit
control spacebar, it'll just maximize
that scene. You could also just come to
the view tab in any sort of viewer and
just go into area and do toggle maximize
area. You know, I'll also say you could
probably sell this procedural material
for $1 or $3 and honestly get like a few
sales. So, another small tip, if you did
shift D to move these around and then
you later want to change something like
this pen right here, I want to add, you
know, a base black to the tip here. Like
for this tip, I want to give it a base
black material and assign it. But these
aren't instances. So these don't update
because they're not instances. If you
did alt d, they would have been. But
that's fine because you can just do ctr
link object data. And then they will
become instances. However, since we are
baking, uh, we actually have to go one
step further and select all these and do
f3 and do make single user object and
data. That way they're completely
independent objects. Another issue you
might encounter is when you join two
objects, your procedural material
changes and glitches. That's because if
you're using the generated coordinate
system, that's based on your bounding
box. And when you join two separate
objects, they become one single object
and the bounding box updates, right?
Which means your coordinate system also
updates. So you'll probably have to
shift your mapping node a little bit to
make your procedural texture work again.
The other alternative is you can bake
first and then join your objects later.
So if you don't want to mess with your
mapping nodes and want to join your
objects later, you can actually
completely totally do that perfectly
fine. Another thing you might have to
fix is your normals. So I covered this
in my previous video, but you can come
up to viewport overlays and check face
orientation to see which direction your
normals are pointing. Everything that is
visible, we want it to be blue because
the 3D software needs to know which side
of our completely flat geometry is the
side that should be interacting with
light. So for these, you can just select
them and go into edit mode. Alt N and
hit flip. Just like that. If you want,
you can hit A to select everything. Go
into edit mode, A to select everything.
And you can probably do recalculate
outside and see if that helps. And
actually, it did solve all our issues.
You might also have issues like this
where you accidentally delete a face and
just like I did. So I accidentally
deleted this inside of this computer.
So, I'm actually going to shift alt and
just select all those and just do
control E bridge edge loops. Now, the
shading is messed up here because now
the shading is messed up because I've
shade smooth on here. So, there's kind
of two ways to fix it. One, you can do
shade auto smooth or since these this
area here needs flat shading because
it's two flat faces, you can just
rightclick and well, make sure you're in
face select, you can just rightclick and
do shade flat, and it'll shade these
faces flat. whereas everything else
would be shade smoothed. Or again, you
could just do shade auto smooth and that
would work as well. Or alternatively,
you can select the edges that should be
sharp and just do control and dot
control E and do mark sharp here. And
now you can see that also fixes the
shading issues that we have. So you'll
also see like these other small issues
here like this is red on the inside
because it's hollow. If I go in here,
you can see it's hollow, which means in
the 3D environment when I'm looking
through here, I'm going to see straight
through it and see this table leg
instead. So to simulate that, like I did
in my previous video, you can go into
solid view, come over here, and do back
face coloring. And you can see I can see
that table like right through there.
That's what we would see in 3GS. So
let's turn off back face coloring. Okay.
So to fix this issue, let's just
confirm. My max camera angle is going to
be here. So you can see we have some
redness here. Honestly, this might not
be an issue here, but whatever. Uh, so
we'll have some issues over here. So
let's just get the top and a little bit
of the side. So let's go into edit mode.
Let's hold click on this. Let's hold
control and select around here. It'll
pick the shortest path there. I think we
can hold control and pick these two
faces as well. And then maybe this one.
And I think I'm going to select this top
over here, too. Whoops. Let's get rid of
this. I don't need to select that. And
okay, we're kind of selecting these
faces right now. And oh, whoops. I
accidentally selected that.
And for some reason, it's actually
selecting that. Okay. So, these are the
faces that are blue on the outside,
which is what we want, but we also want
them blue on the inside. So, what I'm
going to do is just shift Duplicate
them, right click, cancel,
and then scale it down just a little
bit. And then I'm going to hit Alt N
with them still selected, and hit flip.
And now we have a fixed thing.
So, if I go back into out, go to the max
angle here, no red, max angle here, no
red either. Cool. And of course, you
know, make sure to fix things that are
floating and things like that. To make
this glass material, I just used a glass
BSDF. Turn down the roughness and index
of refraction. Now, it doesn't really
matter how you make your glass because
there's multiple ways to make glass. I
just did it this way cuz it was the
quickest. We will be replacing the
material with a glass-like material in
3GS. If you're curious on how I made
like the fish and stuff, again, they're
just subdivision service modifiers. So,
I think earlier in the video, I used
round cubes, which are pretty much just
cubes with subdivision service modifier.
So for the fish specifically, I just
added a cube, give it control 2,
subdivision surface, and I applied it
first, and then I went to edit mode,
just scale it up. Uh, took these top
faces like so. Inset, extrude, gx. Same
thing with the back here. Uh, I think I
just extruded here. I don't actually
remember. I might have inset first. And
then I extrude out, scaled out. And then
once you get a general shape, you can
just add control 2 with another
subdivision service modifier. And you
get a fish really, really quick. Just
like that.
All right. So now we're ready for
baking. So baking is the idea that you
save some sort of information
beforehand. So when you come back to it,
it becomes easier or faster, more
performant or it just saves you time
later down the road. So baking can be
for done for a lot of things like
animations. But for us, we're going to
be doing it with the lighting.
Everything you're seeing when you're in
rendered mode is being calculated as you
move your screen. That's why it's so
laggy for some people and that's why we
have the noise threshold and everything.
And that's exactly why when we go into
the shader editor and we adjust the
lighting, you know, we can see these
updates because everything is being
calculated mathematically behind the
scenes. And these mathematical
calculations like the ray tracing
basically, you know, simulating how
light bounces would really really hurt
the performance on the browser. Since we
have static lighting or lighting that
won't change, it's better just to save
that as part of the texture. So this
color change between this lighted area
and this lighted area that information
can just stay in that texture. That way
when we use it, we don't actually have
to use any lighting because the image
looks like that already. Then obviously
the downside of baking your lighting is
that you can have dynamic shadows for
your baked lights. You can still use
baked textures and real-time lighting
for shadows. Or you could use like a
simulated planes that act like shadows,
but for the bakedin shadows like these,
they can't really be changed, you know,
in in real time easily. You can see on
this website, I think it won sight of
the day on awards, they also baked their
textures. And you can see here, they
baked his hand with the lighting source
there. So that's where the shadow is,
but his hand is moving, but that shadow
is not updating. So, while we get better
performance, you know, we lose a little
bit of realism, but you know, when
you're when your site is really
interactive and there's a lot going on,
very very few people are going to be
paying attention to that shadow. So,
here's another website that won site of
the day on awarders.com. You can see
they have some fairly realistic lighting
like here. And none of this is actually
real-time lighting. So if you take a
look at their textures, the lighting is
actually baked into here. You can see at
some point the GB model that is on this
file is mapping to one of these light
rays, which is why we have all this
realistic looking lighting. So since the
lighting information is stored directly
in the texture, we don't have to do any
expensive realtime mathematical
calculations. If you remember when we
were working with procedural materials,
we had to UV unwrap our model in order
to place a 2D image into our simulated
3D space. So, we're going to be doing
the same thing, except this time, we're
going to be creating our 2D image
texture and trying to unwrap our 3D
model and place it into that texture and
save that lighting information onto that
texture. Now, depending on how large
your scene is, you might need more than
one texture. I'll say from my
experience, I feel like I might have to
go for more than one texture here,
possibly two. So, how would you know?
Well, honestly, you probably wouldn't
until you started baking, just to see
what results you get. Now, you might be
asking, okay, Andrew, how did you
intuitively know that you might need at
least two textures here? Well, first,
it's definitely based on, you know, how
many objects you have and the size of
those objects, as well as what kind of
material is on those textures. When we
bake, we generally stick to powers of
two. So, let me draw like a cube here.
So, we have like 1024 pixels by 1024
pixels, which is like 1K, and then 2040,
right? 204080 by 20480 and then 4K 4096
by 4096 and things like that. So since
your image has a specific amount of
pixels you can use about it. If you have
a bunch of large objects that means
they're going to take up more space on
your texture which means more resolution
and more pixels. Whereas smaller objects
on your scene are going to take less.
And this should make some sort of
intuitive sense. If it's smaller then
the resolution doesn't have to be as
high. It's the same idea when you scale
up an image, it starts getting blurry.
So, you need a higher resolution in
order to prevent it from getting as
blurry. However, this isn't a general
truth because if you have like, for
example, a really large face that isn't
really primarily part of your scene, for
example, back here, what you can do is
take a UV and actually scale it down and
make it really, really small. So yes,
this side would look really blurry, but
now other areas of your scene can take
up more of that texture and get a higher
resolution. So if you keep this large,
for example, it'll take up more pixels
and then possibly some of your other
models that you want more detailed will
become, you know, a little bit more
blurry. Another factor affecting this
issue is the type of material that's
actually on your object. So, if it's a
flat color like this, then you actually
don't need as much of a larger area
compared to if it was like a realistic
PBR material. A blurred solid color
would look quote unquote less blurred
than a material that's very very
detailed. So, for example, this poster
right here, it might be smaller than my
chair, but my chair might actually take
less space on my texture just because
this has more detail and I want it to
have a little bit more detail and more
pixels to bake in there. So, when I said
two textures, I meant two 4K textures
cuz I kind of want to maximize quality
rather than like load times. And I think
with compression methods, given that
most of mine are solid colors rather
than PBR materials, it should be low
enough. Now, there are a lot of advanced
compression methods, but you know, I'm
not going to get it into this video. Or
you can watch my Minecraft video where I
talk a little bit more in depth for some
more complicated compression methods.
Okay. So, when we're baking and UV
editing, there's this other tab here
that we generally use called the UV
editing tab. Same with shading, which
typically when you're doing lighting and
material, you go to the shader tab or
the shading workspace to, you know, work
with that. That way, you kind of have
like a separation of concerns. But, you
know, I've just gotten so used to just
creating my own workspace uh in the
default layout that I don't really
separate them anymore. You can also come
over here and create your own workspace
if you wanted to. But Blender does have
these separate workspaces for us just
with like some sort of setup already. So
that's what I'm going to be doing for
this video. I'm just going to create a
new tab here and create a UV editor. I'm
going to get rid of the shading and I'm
going to get rid of this as well. And
I'm going to make this side a little bit
smaller. Just like that. One of the most
difficult things about unwrapping is
unwrapping it. Well, so when it comes to
simple objects like cubes, all these
primitive objects, if you go into edit
mode, they have, you know, a default
unwrap that's very good and continuous.
Right now, it's really straightforward
for a cube because, well, Blender gave
it to us. But what about more
complicated objects like this? How do we
know we UV unwrapped it properly? Well,
Blender actually has this really helpful
thing and it's called a UV grid. So, if
I come to the shader editor and I search
for an image texture. So, I'm just going
to shift a search for an image texture
like so. Create a new image texture and
you can just call it whatever. I'm just
going to call it UV grid helper
tutorial. And you and then since we're
going for 4K, I'm going to click and
drag down here and do 4096 just like
this. And then under generated type,
instead of blank, you can do UV grid.
Now, we don't need an alpha channel. We
don't have any transparency, so we can
uncheck that. But honestly, it doesn't
really matter if you keep it there.
Create a new image here. And then click
and drag that into the base color. So,
I'm on the wood material because I
select this here. So, let me just copy
that to the cube like link materials.
Let's go to material preview. And now
you can see everywhere that's using my
wood material is now using this UV grid.
This UV grid will show us a lot about
our unwrap and how proper it is. I think
I said it earlier in the video, but
areas with similar amounts of detail
space should have roughly equal sized
cubes or squares in this case. So here
it actually seems that these aren't
terrible. But you can see that some of
these cubes are being a little bit
stretched, but it's fairly consistent
across the whole thing, which means it's
probably not as big of an issue. Now,
watch what happens when I go into edit
mode and start distorting this. Take a
look at that. That means if we had an
image, any other image across his face,
it would start completely distorting.
Like this poster, if I go into edit mode
and start dragging that, take a look
what's happening to my image. You know,
that doesn't look great. So this UV
texture kind of helps us determine that.
It'll also show us, you know,
distinguishly where are the seams or the
areas that we cut it out. Example here,
you can see that there's definitely a
clear seam over here because the blocks
aren't really continuing and there's
like a hard line. So when you're
unwrapping and cutting seams, you kind
of want to make it you kind of want to
find a places to hide those seams. Now,
if you want to see the stretching, you
can actually come into the UV editor.
Let's actually open up our UV grid
helper like so. And when you go into
edit mode, make sure you're in edit mode
to see everything. You can come use your
middle mouse button to click and drag
over here. Come over to overlays and
turn on UV stretch. Like so. Just like
that. And generally what you want is
everything to be this solid blue color,
which means there's very, very little
stretching. And if I take one of these
UVs and move it, you can see it's
changing color, which means it's
definitely stretching really, really
hard. And you can also see that updated
on my texture as I move this around.
It's really really distorting just like
that. So I'm just going to undo all
those changes here. I'll also say you
know notice when I select over here for
some reason it's also selecting vertices
over here. Now how does that make any
sense? If it's the same verticy why is
it appearing over here as well? Well in
real life imagine you know when you're
like doing reverse origami or like you
know trying to wrap something from a 2D
onto like a 3D object. You need areas to
cut which we called seam. So the areas
that we cut or the seams, they quote
unquote split it into two visual
vertices, but essentially it's the same
exact verticy. And they don't have to be
right next to each other on your UV map.
If you don't understand whatever I'm
talking about right now, that's totally
okay because I feel like you'll get it,
you know, as we go through this chapter.
So by default, when I hit unwrap, you
know, Blender already has, you know, a
default area that it quote unquote marks
seams for us automatically, but we can
also mark our own seams and unwrap
there. So, you might be wondering, okay,
how do I even know where to mark seams?
It doesn't really make sense. I can
visualize it for a cube, sure, but like
what about these other objects? So,
there's a few methods that I'll talk
about in a little bit. But first, I
don't actually like adjusting the
material itself to use this UV grid
texture. And the reason for that is just
because it requires an extra step. So,
I'm just going to unhook that. I'm going
to still leave it here, but I'm going to
unhook that and bring my wood material
back in here. What I'm going to do
overstead is come over here. Make sure
you are in solid view. If you come over
here and go into color, you can select
texture. And what texture will do is it
will use your image texture as what
you're seeing on the UV. However, you
know, if I still go into material
preview or rendered, you can see that
it's still going to see the wood. It's
only in solid view. So, you'll often see
people use mat caps like this one, which
kind of helps with if you have any
shading issues. You might have seen, you
know, some things like this, which kind
of highlights, you know, the edges and
cavity maps and things like that. You
can also see like you have this cavity
option here as well. So, a lot of
options, but you know, it doesn't really
matter for us at the moment. Right now,
I'm just going to go back into studio
and I'm just going to use texture.
Another thing I like to do when I'm
editing instead of, you know, having to
mark seams like E and mark seam and then
A and then unwrap and then, you know, do
an unwrap. So, what I like to do instead
is do a live unwrap. So if you come over
to the options in edit mode and do live
unwrap and then with live unwrap enabled
when you use the shortest path like
control and pick shortest path here what
you can do instead of select for edge
tag you can do tag seam and now as as I
hold control and pick my shortest path
it's going to live UV unwrap for me. So
you can see as I'm holding holding
control and clicking on my sides it's
updating my UV map just like that. So
instead of always having to hit a U
unwrap, it will just unwrap for you as
you start marking your seams. To get rid
of them, you can hold control and pick
the shortest path. And if there's
already a seam there, it will just get
rid of it for you. So I'm just holding
control and get rid of these seams right
here. So earlier in the video, I
mentioned about UV unwrapping intuition.
So now I kind of just want to talk a few
of those now. So when it comes to UV
unwrapping, what you generally want to
think about even when you're unwrapping
complicated objects like this or this or
this or this is try and think of it as
its default primitive object. That'll be
a little more clear once we get started.
But even some of the most scaryl looking
models actually have very very simple UV
unwraps if you think of them in terms of
primitive objects. And what you'll find
is a lot of them are going to be like
cylinders like in a sort of cylinder
sort of unwrap or a cube. So if I go
into edit mode, you can see by default
it's unwrap. Well, now we don't see any
seams here because you know it's just
built into Blender. But what we can do
is hit A to select everything UV and
come to seams from islands. So every
individual set of connected UV faces is
what we call an island. So here we can
do UV seams from islands. And now you
can see we have those seams on on over
here. Take a look at how they do it.
They cut out the top and they cut out
the bottom. Now again, just imagine you
had a piece of paper in this shape and
you need to flatten it into 2D shape. If
you cut off the top and cut off the
bottom, let's just come over here and
clear the seam with control E clear
seam. Also, right click and do add to
quick favorites. I have it quick
favorites. So, it's showing remove, but
add it because it'll it'll speed up your
workflow. So, if you do Q, you can just
do clear seam instead of going to Ctrl E
and clear seam. Or again, you can set
your own hotkey if you wanted to. So
take a look at what happens when I
remove their seam. We get this extreme
stretching here. Now, why does that make
sense? Well, you have this thing here
that we call a ring. And imagine you had
a piece of paper in this ring format,
and you had to like flatten it on the
ground. That would be impossible without
ripping the paper. In 3D, you can't like
rip that, right? So instead, they just
display it as stretching. If you want to
flatten a ring, you need to chop it up
somewhere. So it can be anywhere across
the ring. You just need to break it up
somewhere so it can flatten. So we just
mark seam and look we get it back. So
this is something that you'll see over
and over again even in complicated
objects which is why I kind of wanted to
mention that. The second general
intuition when it comes to unwrapping
hard surface models and maybe even
organic models is to look at individual
parts as individual primitive objects.
So kind of tying into the first general
guideline. So if I go into edit mode and
like I inset this for example and then
extrude downwards you can see okay now
we get some differences in the UVs
compared to this and this you know
generally we want to keep everything
right the same size now obviously
different circumstances and things like
that but general rule of thumb you want
to keep everything roughly the same
textual density and then you can tinker
with that a little bit later but I'll
get into that a little bit later. So in
order to fix this how would we fix this?
Well, if you think about it, just ignore
the rest of this cube. Honestly, if you
want to do like this, Ctrl I, and then
hit H to hide it. Like, just view this
for a second. What does it look like? If
you said cylinder, you would actually be
kind of correct. We have a ring and then
we have a bottom face. If you said cube,
you would also be correct. But in this
case, the cylinder unwrap for this quote
unquote cube actually works a lot
better. So, if I do Alt H to rehide
those stuff, sorry, unhide that stuff.
We already know how to unwrap a
cylinder. So we can just apply it to
this same sort of area here. Hold alt,
select this loop, Q or Ctrl + E, mark
seam. And then we can just select this
bottom face. It'll select all the sides
for us. E mark seam. Now we're getting
somewhere. And then of course we're
getting that distortion because we have
a ring that we can flatten right right
over here. So we just pick any sort of
one of these corners just like on the
cylinder. E mark seam. And take a look
at that. We just fixed up this entire
place. So because we cut this out from
this side of the cube, this we can now
just envision this entire side of the
cube as the same as any other side of
this cube. Which means we can just
unwrap this like a normal cube now. So
we can just do something like this. And
just shift shift control E mark seam.
And then down the side over here like
so.
Control oh on this one as well. control
E mark seam and take a look at that. We
have our default cube unwrap and then we
have our side unwrap over here. So what
you see here is we have a quote unquote
cylinder and then a quote unquote
default regular cube with you know some
sort of extra geometry there. Now you
might be asking okay why do we just have
one seam you know why not I place it
here and here and here and well and you
know mark seam is there as well. I mean,
that's perfectly valid as well. But
again, we're trying to minimize the
amount of seams. But if for some reason
you do need those extra seams there,
then you can totally do that. But for
us, that isn't really necessary. All we
really need is just to cut out the ring
once. Okay. So, I kind of hope that
clears up UV unwrapping as you'll find
that a lot of really, really complicated
objects can be broken down into their
perimeter shapes. So, just ignored the
fact that for every single material, I
copy and pasted the UV grid helper into
their materials. So, I just went through
each of them and just Ctrl +V paste it
and made sure it was the active one,
which you can see here. Everything's
really large because none of the UVs are
set, but they'll update as we update our
things. So, let's unwrap our first thing
together. Probably this piano over here.
And all these green edges means they're
sharp edges. And that's likely from our
weighted normal modifier or when we used
bevel and we did harden normals, we're
marking all these sharp edges. And then
typically when you comes to UV
unwrapping, if you want to go the quick
way about it, you can just hit U unwrap
and do smart UV project. And 66 by
default works fairly well for hard
surface models. And if you hit unwrap,
you can see that, you know, we get a not
too terrible unwrap here. And then you
can do what we did previously, Q seams
from islands. And then you can kind of
just go in edit mode and see, you know,
what sort of unwrap they give us here.
So the from far away, you know, it
doesn't seem too bad. And this is
honestly passable because we're working
with solid colors. And for the most
part, you know, there's minimal
distortion. Professionally, you know, it
looks a little bit weird, right? Like
over here, you'd kind of expect it to
continue the loop rather than go up and
then down over here. Same thing. Same
thing over here. It seems like there it
kind of like goes janky to the left and
whatnot. Same over here, it seems like
this doesn't really continue. Goes to
the side. So, and if we look at, you
know, these other areas again here, you
can see this is symmetrical geometry,
but over here it's going on the left.
And then here it's going on, well, it's
also going on the left here, but like
left relative to this side. And this is
like left relative to this side. So it's
a little bit inconsistent. And then here
we just have a basic cylinder, but
they're adding like multiple seams
across the cylinder which are just extra
seams. So even if I get rid of these,
for example, Q clear seam, like
nothing's going to change over here
because we already have one that's
breaking the the ring over here. Yeah,
it's not the perfect, but it does save
you a lot of time. Now, the UV unwrap
may not be perfect, but it does give you
a general guideline on how to approach
your model. So, here we have a lot of
bevel modifiers. So, if I add a cube
real quick, and let me just link one of
these materials with this. I'm just
going to manually bevel this like over
here. When you want to unwrap this
beveled cube, you might be wondering,
there's so many edges. There's like one
here, there's one here, there's one
here, there's one here. You know, it's
like which one do you select? You know,
in the past there was just one single
one and now there's like multiple. Well,
again, honestly, it really really
depends on what your priority is.
Generally, what I like to do, like let's
say your only goal is to minimize
distortion along these sort of corners
because that's where it's going to have
the most issue. Then what you would do
is have a seam on every single sides of
the bevel. So, for example, I'd select,
well, actually, I don't have to select
all of them. I can just select one,
shift G, select similar area, and it'll
just select all of them because, you
know, they have the same length and
width. And I do mark seam. Now, of
course, we have all this distortion
because this entire thing, if I hold, if
I select this face and do Ctrl L, you
can see, you know, imagine trying to
flatten that out. So, what we can do is
probably select all of these, right?
Shift G, select a similar area. So, we
get all of these and dot control E mark
seam. And take a look at that. we get
something that is very very well tixel
density optimized. Now obviously the
downside here is we have all these extra
seams here. So we could get rid of
these. So if I do clear seam you can see
it goes from something like this to
something like this. So yes we have some
distortion and stretching here but you
know at least it continues now and the
distortion is very very minimal. Of
course if you marked every single edge
you know as a seam we would get perfect
blue every single time right because
everything is just its own individual
face. But that's way too many seams. If
we made every single corner like this,
then every single corner would be like
this. And and that would be a pretty
good unwrap if your goal was to to
minimize distortion. Now, what if your
second goal is to minimize the amount of
seams possible? Well, if you look at it
again, you can see a ring here. Or if
you want to visualize it this way, you
can do that as well. Then maybe you can
just unwrap it like a cylinder.
Distortion might not be your primary
goal, but minimizing seam. So you could
have like one over here. Mark your seam.
And then maybe you want over here. Ctrl
+ E, mark your seam. And then anywhere
along the ring, you can fix that just by
marking a seam. So you can just pick
somewhere where no one will see or less
frequently see. And just mark the seam
there. And take a look what we get. We
get fairly equal tixel density, just a
little bit stretching along the sides
over here, of course. But for all
intended purposes, we minimize the
amount of seams, and it looks pretty
good equal in texel density. If you kind
of want to get the best of quote unquote
both worlds in this scenario, you can
try and do what UV project is doing. So
unwrap here and hit Q seam from islands,
you can see what they're trying to do.
They're kind of just trying to slice
along the center bevel. In this case, we
don't actually have a center bevel
because we have a even number 1 2 3 4.
If I had one with five, which I'll just
create real quick, ctr Link materials.
And here I'll just uh Ctrl +B center
one. So this should have five here. And
then now I do UV unwrap smart UV project
unwrap cube seams from islands. You can
see what it does is it cuts through the
center. Now it's cutting everything. So
we have six individual
faces. Now originally I said that was
bad because there's no relationship
information. But since we're doing
baking and we're not using this map for
texturing, this is kind of ideal in the
sense that it will fit along our UV map
with other objects very very well. And
we're maximizing the amount of texture
space along along this entire object.
And of course, you know, since it's a
beveled cube, I went back to the one
with just three bevels. And then, of
course, you know, since it's just a
cube, you can use the same method that
we did to unwrap the cube. And you can
see here we get the default cube unwrap
except with the beveled areas obviously
being stretched there. So there's pros
and cons to each of these methods. It
depends on what you're working with as
you expand your knowledge in Blender.
For us, does the method actually matter?
And the answer is no because our seams
aren't going to be that visible when we
bake. And since we're working with solid
colors, even if we have some major
distortion like this, that means over
here would have a lot less resolution
compared to over here. But since we're
working with a color, colors when
they're blurry will look a lot more
similar to each other from a high
resolution and low resolution area
compared to things like PBR materials or
like actual images, you know, that we
had on on the photo frames and things
like that. So, we have a very very
flexible way to approach our unwrap. So,
just when you're unwrapping, don't you
don't actually have to care about, you
know, what method am I using? Is it the
best? You know, is this right? Whatever.
just try and follow the general
guidelines like across the areas you
want similar size squares, you want to
minimize distortion, and you kind of
want to minimize the amount of seams.
But again, you know, that really
actually ends up depending on your use
case. So, you'll definitely see me use a
lot of different approaches and methods
when I'm UV unwrapping. I'll try and
explain why I'm making that decision as
I do it. But honestly, sometimes the
answer might just be because I want to
save time and that's kind of like the
only reason because again, we're doing
this for baking a texture rather than
exporting it to texture or texturing it.
So, we we could actually have extremely
sloppy UVs. Like even on over here, we
could have like one UV like this. And if
we baked with this, even though it's
distortion, this would actually look
perfectly fine. Because essentially what
we're doing is we're taking that solid
color and spreading it across the
texture like this. But again, with
colors, it can be very, very blurry and
it wouldn't look any much more different
than a place with more pixels of colors.
Not always, but you know, a lot of times
it will be. Again, I kind of want to
unwrap in the proper way in the event
that you come back here and you want to
export it to another 3D software to
texture in or you want to apply a PBR
material. So that means under object
data properties, we can come over here
to UV maps. If you applied PBR
materials, you're by default using this
default one that comes with every object
called UV map. So this is the UV map for
texturing. We want one for baking. So
all we can do is just create a new one
and call that baking. And it'll just
clone your UV map. So, here I didn't use
a PBR material. I didn't use UVs to
match this either. But again, that
doesn't matter because we used a solid
color in here or quote unquote a
procedural material that doesn't use UVs
to determine how to texture on it. Now,
something that did use the UV to
determine how to map our image texture
is something like this computer screen
over here. So, if I hit home, this image
here, if I go into UV map, I used the UV
map. I used this UV map to map my image
texture onto the screen perfectly. So
here we have one UV map for mapping the
texture to the 3D object. Now what we
need is a second one called baking. And
this one will be taking this 3D model
and putting it on a texture to bake with
all the other textures. So for example,
if I have this one highlighted at
baking, this one highlighted at baking
as well, you can just go into edit mode,
U, smart UV project together, and now
they're sharing the same texture. Now,
right now it looks messed up because I
have baking highlighted. But you can see
this render icon here, which means
during baking process, it'll use this
map for the image texture when it's
baking on this active baking UV map. So,
if you want, you can just leave it back
there for now. We'll get to that when we
get to that. Okay. So, when it comes to
this piano, I'm going to hit all and
clear seams. Let's just do it manually
for us. Now, I made a sort of a small
issue here because now if we were to do
this manually, we would have to mark a
seam on every single one of these.
Whereas, if we did an array modifier,
unwrapped one of these piano keys, and
then used the array modifier and then
applied the array modifier, then we
would only have to unwrap one of these
keys because they all have the same
geometry here. Now, that's an easy fix
because what we can do is just select
all the keys, like one side on the keys.
Well, actually, box select might be
faster here. Oh, I don't want to select
the piano. Maybe just in case, we just
do something like this. And we can do
Ctrl L and just delete those vertices.
So now we have one here. We can do Ctrl
L and P separate by selection after
selecting it. So we can actually go into
local view here. And I'm just going to
be going for the UV unwrap method here.
So quote unquote, the best of both
worlds. I'm just going to pop one over
here. Mark seam. Control E mark seam or
Q mark seam if you have it. Quick
favorites. Now, when it comes to slicing
off the ring, I'm going to put it on the
side because that'll be less visible
than over here because all the piano
keys are next to each other. So, what we
can do is just do over here. And same
thing on this side. We can just put it
on the side because that'll be hidden.
Again, we want to hide our seams as best
as possible. So, that's why I'm deciding
to put it on the side there. So, if I go
in here, hit A, you can see we have a
pretty great pretty good unwrap with
even textile density. Now we can just do
our array modifier stuff again. Oh, I
forgot to mention, you might be
wondering, okay, why didn't I put a seam
at the bottom? Well, that's because I
deleted all the faces at the bottom, so
there's nothing to cut out there. If you
left the faces in, yes, you would also
have to add a seam on the bottom there.
Yeah. So, I just redid the array
modifier. By the way, if you did save
your original piano in a modifiers
collection, you could have just used
that one. F3, convert to mesh. Applies
that. And then we can join it with the
piano or you can wait after we're done
with the rest of the piano. So now if I
go into edit mode, you can see all of
them have the same exact unwrap, which
is really, really nice. I'll also say if
you go in here and you get a slightly
different result when you're unwrapping,
it's probably because you're using a
different unwrapping method. You can see
there's different kinds here. And if you
take a look on the Blender
documentation, you can actually read
what each of these does. when it comes
to hard surface models like the ones
we're working with conformo generally
work seems to work the best for us. So
that's what the method that I'm going to
be using at the moment. Now I will also
say since all of these have the baking
map when they're actively highlighted
they will be sharing the same exact
texture. So, as we unwrap more objects,
like for example, this one, the piano
and the key over here, since they're
sharing the same UV map, they're going
to be sharing. Since we have both of
them on the baking UV map highlighted,
they're going to be overlapping each
other. Take a look what happens when I
switch this to UV map. Now, we only see
the one of the texture sets. If you want
to do manual packing with your baked
texture, what I recommend you do after
you're done unwrapping something is just
to scale it down and just move it off
somewhere into oblivion. That way when
you revisit it and do like enter tab
mode here. Now is it that big of a deal?
Honestly, no. Because you can always
just move it later. You don't have to
select both of them. You can just select
one and then move it out later. Or
depending on your method, if you unwrap
them together, let's say we just go
conformal, then Blender will try and
pack it by default for you with the
objects that you selected. So if that's
your workflow, then you don't really
have to move things outside. But if you
want to manually pack things, you might
as well just move things outside
beforehand. That way you don't have to
do it later. But again, not really a big
deal for us. So let's focus on each of
these individual parts. Like ideally we
probably should not have joined these
objects until after baking. That way we
can quickly enter local view, but that's
totally fine because what we can do is
always just select something and then
Ctrl I to invert our selection and hide
everything else. And then now we can
just enter local view. And now you can
see we just have this. So here you can
see that we already have some sharp
edges here. And honestly, there is a
really really common workflow where you
use sharp edges as your seams because
oftent times it works perfectly fine.
But again, I'm also trying to minimize
the amount of seams. So for a model like
this, I'm actually going to take the
center bevel and unwrap it like that. So
here you can see that we have a loop
over here over here. So I'm just going
to continue that across the model.
Hopefully that gets everything like so.
Let's do over here as well.
Just holding shift alt shift alt. Let's
continue over here. And that should get
everything. We can mark our first seam
over there. All right. And remember now
we have an inset cube here and an inset
cube here. So what we want to do is cut
it out. So here we can have a we can put
our cutout over here just like we did
when we had an inside cube. Now this
just says bevels. Ctrl + E mark seam. So
this is cut out. And then of course we
need one here. E mark seam. Right? You
can just imagine this is like the box
that we did earlier. And of course, now
we have a ring, right? It's just spread
across several bevels instead of just
one continuous uh sort of loop instead
of just one continuous face. So again,
if you want to break this ring,
honestly, this ring is probably not that
problematic, but again, probably cut it
over here, like over here, and then one
over here. Again, if you want to
minimize the amount of seams, then you
can just have one and that would be it
for the entire loop. Again, you also
want to take into consideration how
effective your unwrap is when you're
packing. And generally, what we want to
go for is everything to be kind of like
a square because those are going to be
easier to pack with a lot of objects
compared to something like this, if that
makes sense. Because at the end of the
day, the entire texture is a square. So
working with like rectangles and squares
will pack better than some sort of
distorted shape like this. So here you
can see I'm combining methods this time.
This time instead of just using one seam
for the entire ring like we did earlier,
I'm using two and then on each corner
just to flatten out things a little bit.
Is this overkill? Possibly. But does it
matter? Honestly not. For us it does
not. So same thing over here. Just like
this. And now you can see the result is
very few distortion, definitely more
seams, but you know, we also have things
that are easier to pack. And now we just
have this inside piano, right? So let's
cut that out. So we can do the same
thing maybe around here. Hold control.
I'm just going around the center bevel.
Whoops. Let's make sure I don't get that
over there. Just holding control.
Slicing over. Wait, actually, I think I
can hit alt and get this entire loop.
Yeah. And then I can hit alt and get
this entire loop. Cool. Ctrl + E mark
seam. I don't want to continue along
this edge. Again, if you wanted to do
the two faces, you could totally do
that, but I'm just going along the
center bevel. So, I'm just going to
continue over here down to this seam.
And we can clear these two. So, Q clear
seam. And then we can continue this on
here. So, Ctrl + E mark seam. And let's
just make sure. Yeah. Okay. I can clear
these two out as well. Now, are there
add-ons that if your geometry is
symmetrical, you can just copy one half
to the other? Yes, they are, I believe,
but most of them are paid. So, I'm not
going to be using them in this video.
So, again, we can just continue on here
along the edge over here. So, control E,
mark seam. We can just hold alt and
hopefully get everything here. Mark
seam.
Seems to look pretty good here. We can
continue over on this side as well.
Again, it's just symmetrical. Hold alt
control e mark seam. So let's make sure
it's also getting the back but it's not.
So that's okay. So control E mark seam.
Sorry I keep doing control E when I
should be doing Q. So there's an over
there. And I think this is going to be
the last one. So just over here and
connect down there. So if you take a
look at our piano and let me just go
control spacebar. We did a fairly fairly
good job. Again, we cut this out. So,
this can just imagine it's just like a
face. Then we cut this out with our UV
unwrap. So, the entire thing is just a
rectangle. UV unwrap method to have six
individual faces, right? Like here and
here, quote unquote individual faces,
but you kind of get what I'm talking
about. That way, we maximize texture
space and minimize distortions. Yes, we
had more seams, but for us, this is
going to be a good unwrap. Now, we can
alt H to unhide our stuff. We can come
back here and just do Ctrl LR I H and
hide. And now work on this over here.
Okay. So, how would I unwrap something
like this? Well, again, you could
definitely go for the center bevel.
Well, I guess in this case, it's not
really a center bevel, but you could
just, you know, do this on every single
side, including the bottom side as well.
And that would be a perfectly good
unwrap. Given what we're going for, a
baking texture and my background
experience, I wouldn't invest more than
2 seconds on this. And what I would do
is just select a face like this. Shift
G, select similar area like so. It'll
select both of them. Control E, mark
seam, and just be done with it. And if I
go into the UV, you can see that we get
a pretty decent unwrap here. And here
you can see that, you know, the textual
density is very very uniform around
here. And you know, we don't really have
to touch anything. Now, if you want to
optimize for baking, you probably want
to straighten these out a little bit.
But for texturing, you might actually
want to leave them a little bit more
distorted. So, if you want to straighten
them out, I like using this plugin here
called UV squares. And he's leaving it
open source. So, you can just download
the zip, come into edit, preferences,
add-ons, install from disk, and you can
see I have it over here, check mark. So,
when I hit N, you can see that I have
this thing here called UV squares. And
to use it, you have to turn off UV sync
selection. You can select one of these
that was not square. And you just select
it, do Ctrl L. Whoops. Do Ctrl L just to
select the entire thing. Select one of
these and then do Ctrl L over here and
do two grid by shape and it will
actually just make your UV look like a
shape. Now, of course, it's distorting
because we're definitely going to need
more seams in order to counteract that
distortion, but again, we're baking
here, so this distortion actually
doesn't really concern us at all. So,
here we're maximizing for packing, but
we are not optimizing for texturing. So,
for us, again, I wouldn't spend more
than 2 seconds on unwrapping this. So,
I'm just going to leave it like this.
And this is honestly good enough for a
rectangular shape. Okay, so let's do Alt
H to get back the stuff that we hid. So
how would I unwrap this? Well, if you
look at it, the entire thing is just a
giant cylinder with some extrusions. So
as long as we cut these out, then the
rest is essentially just becomes a
cylinder. But instead of marking the
seams for every single one of these,
that would be kind of tedious. I'm just
going to trust that smart UV project
will handle this for us. So ctr L U,
smart UV project. Unwrap. It looks okay.
Not much distortion. Hit A to select
everything. Q. Seams from islands. And
that did a pretty good job here. Now,
it's definitely giving us probably some
extra seams. And you can see this is an
extra seam as well as here, right? We
only have one ring. So, we don't need
two seams here. And we actually don't
need a seam at all because this deleted
face on the bottom is acting like a seam
of sorts. So, it's already flattened. It
can already be flattened without a seam.
So, we can actually just get rid of
these seams over here and all the way
back here as well. And again, you can
see that it's still working perfectly
fine because we have the top half which
is being cut out through a seam. And
this is the seam down the side and the
back doesn't even have a back. So, we
don't need anything to cut out there.
So, we can fix this over here as well.
Just like so.
Don't need a seam here.
And don't need a seam here as well. So
everything looks good with our piano so
far. Ideally, yes, over here I probably
should not overlap them. There'll be
like a black line over here and over
here when I bake, but honestly, that
might actually add a little bit more
realism as well. So, is it worth
spending the time to fix? Well, that's
kind of up to you. So, the last thing
for the piano then is just this top area
over here. And then these, of course, so
these are just cylinders. So, we can
just select these. Ctrl + E, mark seam.
And then over here in the back, we want
to hide our seams. Q more seam. Okay.
So, how do unwrap these? Again, you have
multiple methods. If you think about it,
this is just a raised version of this
inset. So, you could just unwrap it the
same way, right? Select these faces,
control E, mark seam, and then now we
have this loop. So, if you want to save
time, you only need one. So, we could
just put something over here. And this
honestly would be perfectly fine for us.
And you can see that yes, we have a ring
here, but it's not really too much of an
issue because it's not like a completely
distorted ring. But, you know, if you
want to
cut it out, you can totally do that.
But, you know, if you want to do the
same thing we did for the inset one, you
know, alternatively, if you want to just
do something quick and dirty, you can
clear seam. Just go along the inner edge
like this, or sorry, the inner bevel,
control E, mark seam. And this would be
a perfectly valid unwrap as well,
depending on your goal. Again, there is
a ring here, but that's totally okay.
And honestly, for what we're doing, you
might not actually even need seams for
this kind of object at all because it's
only half of an object. And Blender can
handle that very, very well. So, if I
select this entire thing, you know,
leaving the key as is with no seams is
actually perfectly valid when it comes
to baking. So, if you want to do that
for the rest of these, you can totally
do that. And I'll just leave that for
the purpose of this tutorial. I'm
actually just going to not have a seam
there at all. Remember, we're
highlighting baking when we're
unwrapping here, not UV map. Now, if for
some reason all of your scenes, never
use UV map. You can just use UV map
instead of having a second one, but I
kind of like to have two separate ones
just in case. Okay, so now we can just
join these pianos, everything in the
piano together like so. Again, make sure
they both have the same UV maps and do
Ctrl + J. And now we have a very well
unwrapped piano. Just like that. So,
right now they're all overlapping, but
we can hit A to select everything and
then just U and again conformal here
just to see what it looks like. And it
looks pretty good together. Super cool.
So, if you want again, you can move that
off into Oblivion. So, the fact that we
did the piano, you generally have a good
idea on how to pretty much do, you know,
anything that's kind of similar to the
piano. Now, anything that's like cubish
and extruded and inset, that sort of
stuff. So, for example, if I go in here
and you have no idea where to start or
you just want to save your time, you can
just unwrap smart UV project unwrap and
then Q seams from islands. And if you
look at what they give you, you can see
that they're prioritizing the center
bevel. Again, it has some issues here.
So, you probably want to continue this
one up, right? And then you would
continue this here and get rid of this
seam. That way, it's more consistent
along where it's cutting. Again, not
really a big deal. Or you can continue
this one and get rid of this one. Or
like we did for some other ones, if you
want, you can select the faces, right?
And of course, all these other ones as
well. And I deleted the back and the
bottom so there's nothing to select. E
mark seam. And then, of course, you have
all these corners. So, you can cut them
out like we did for the beveled cube.
And you could just go around doing that
for, you know, every single corner. So
down here as well.
So really up to your use case. And then
of course we have a ring here. Of course
we have a ring here. Do we have to fix
this? Honestly, probably not, but might
as well. So anything mark seam. You can
have four seams if you want. This is a
extra seam that doesn't contribute
anything. So we can clear those. The
issue there, same thing here. This is a
flat face. So the seam doesn't actually
provide any value here. Now maybe if it
was like really too long, you know,
having a seam will split it up a little
bit. So you can see if I have Q here
mark seam now they can be packed as
individual faces like so. But at the
same time, you know, now we have to line
things up if we want to make it look
seamless. So you can see I just went
around and added a bunch of seams. But
again, if you want to use other method,
that's totally fine. All right. So let's
do something a little bit different like
Mr. Rabbit over here. So if I go into
edit mode on Mr. rabbit. What prone
object did we use to shape Mr. Rabbit?
Well, I used a cube with a subdivision
surface modifier. So, essentially, we
can just treat this like a cube or, you
know, same with the room at all. We can
just So, we can just do the same thing.
We can just uh come over here, select
the round side at the top, control E,
mark seam, and then on the corners, we
can just slice it off like so. And
honestly, if you want to just leave it
like a cylinder and minimize seams, this
is actually fairly fairly well. So you
can see that this is actually not that
bad at all. But again, if you want to
make it very minimal stretching, you can
just do it something like this. Now you
can see that the stretching is a little
bit better and this might be a little
bit easier to pack than something else.
Again, when you're modeling, don't
forget to come over here to UV maps and
add the baking UV map. Now, you might be
asking, okay, why don't you just like
place, let me just do this real quick.
Clear seam. Why not just cut it in here
and over here and over here and then
just mark seam like that is similar
stretching. That looks like equal
textual density. Why you doing all that
complicated fancy stuff? Well, on a
simple model, yeah, it might not be a
big deal. And when we're baking, this
seems appropriate for baking as well.
But again, when it comes to like
texturing and things, your seams are
going to cause some issues. And
generally, I kind of like to follow the
rule like, you know, treat everything
like a primitive object. And that way,
you know, you'll just be more consistent
over time that way. So, yes, you would
be right saying like, you know, in this
case, okay. But generally, I like to
just stick with with, you know, treating
things like they're primitive objects.
So, same thing with the ear. If I go in
here, cube unwrap here. So, I just cut
out the top, the top, and if you wanted
to just do a cylinder one, you totally
could just have one seam to get rid of
the ring. The bottom face is deleted.
So, no seam is necessary there. Same
with the speaker over here. This we used
a round cube, which is just a subdivided
cube. You can see that I cut out the
cylinder over here. There was a ring in
here, and then I added a edge over
there. And then, since I cut this out,
everything the rest of everything else
was just a round cube. So, I cut out the
top just like Mr. Rabbit and then cut
out the sides just like this. You'll
notice that we do have some odd little
shape here. Does it really matter? Not
really. But if you wanted to, you know,
you could like
continue the seam down here and possibly
this would be a little bit better for
baking. Definitely not for texturing
because we have more seams, but okay.
So, let's take a look at something where
we use a different method to unwrap like
using sharp edges. So this will come in
handy a lot like when on over here. Now
this is something we probably should
have unwrapped first before applying our
array modifier. But the luckily thingy
here is we can use that select sharp
edges here. So we can do select and do
sharp edges. And you can see it'll
select all our sharp edges. And if we do
control E mark seam, you can see that
that actually works fairly well for us.
Of course since we cut out all these
cylinders, we do get a bunch of rings.
Now, this isn't particularly a big issue
for us, but again, we already know how
to get rid of seams. Sorry, I mean, you
know, rings.
And this might be a little bit better to
pack, but and then it seems like we
still have rings back here. So, I must
have forgot to delete these. So, shift
G, select similar normal, and then we
can just delete those faces there. It
also seems we have like this really long
thing, which probably could pack fine,
but we might as well get rid of it. I
think it's because of Yeah. So it's like
continuing on over here. So we actually
don't need to see that at all. So we can
just hold control. Unfortunately, it's
getting the entire edge loop and delete
those faces. Same thing up here.
Control delete those faces. So now's the
good time if you forget to delete some
of your faces to actually start deleting
them.
And delete those faces. Just like that.
And there you can see that, you know, we
have a fairly good unwrap here. So I
just unwrapped with conformal and we can
move that off into oblivion if we want
to. So again let's take a look at
something that's slightly different. So
let's take a look at text for example.
Now text is fairly similar to these logo
SVG logos. At the end of the day they
you can just think of them like
cylinders. You have a face over here, a
face over here. Well I deleted the back
face here. So you just have a seam along
this way. Now, for some reason, even
though they're merged by distance, I
can't select the edge loop here. So,
what I'm going to do actually for this
is use smart UV project and let it
handle for us. Like so. And you can see
it does a good job when it's like 90°
angles. It does a good job finding them.
So, we can just hit A just like
everything. Q seams from islands. And
you can see that it does a fairly good
job. Now, it is giving us these extra
seams along this along the ring here.
But this might actually be good in some
cases because you don't want it to be
too long. If you want to spend the extra
few seconds optimizing where to place
these, you can totally do that. But, you
know, time is money. So, if you're happy
with that, then you can totally just
leave it as is. You can also see here
they kind of have issues as well. It's
going like zigzag again. But, is it
worth the time to fix? So, this text is
going to be the same approach. When I do
the logo again, you can just treat it
like a cylinder. Select the outer loop.
Ctrl E mark seam. And then one of the
sides, control E mark seam. And this is
kind of unnecessary over here. Clear
seam. So the L is kind of unwrapped
properly. If you want to add extra seams
because it's too long, the ring is too
long, you can totally do that. Again,
you know, why spend the extra time when
UV unwrap can do it properly. So you
smart UV project wrap. This looks okay.
Q seamst islands. So, if I look at it,
you know, generally it looks okay, but
there's definitely some things that
would cause, you know, a little bit
complicated packing issues like this
thing over here or this L here. Yes, you
can put stuff inside, but then it kind
of looks a little bit weird that you
have something wrapping some something
that's unrelated. But again, it's not
really a big deal. So, you can just
leave it as is and save your time and
move that into Oblivion.
So, again, nothing really special here.
You just select the edge loop. Hopefully
this one you can get a complete one. So,
and maybe like this. Control E mark
seam. You can see that's going to work
fairly well. But again, but you know,
instead of just doing one at a time, we
can just select all of them. Again, make
sure for each of these baking is
highlighted. Your second UV map UV
unsmart UV project Q scenes from
islands. Okay, cool. Good enough for us.
So, we can start moving these into our
unwrapped collection. And we can just
uncheck unwrapped if we want to. So,
let's take another example. We can
review the rounded cube again or the
subdivision cube, right? All of these
were subdivided cubes. So, you can kind
of already envision how we're going to
unwrap. You know, take like one of these
circles, right? Sorry, I guess they're
not circles, but like one of these tops
and then cut along the sides. Same with
this one. We could do something like
here, cut out the ring. And then maybe,
you know, have one on four corners. And
then for the top, it's like a elongated
sort of curved cube. So in that case
then it kind of makes sense to cut out
the center part and a little bit of the
sides. That way when it's flattened it
can be flattened easily. So if I do
smart UV project
unwrap huge seams from islands you can
see that's kind of exactly what we get.
They're trying to cut off a little bit
of the top. So it's easier to flat this
than a completely bent piece of paper.
And obviously the angles over here are
going to be easier to bend. Then when it
comes to the headphones, again, they do
they mess up a little bit here with the
with not being parallel. So if you want
to fix that, you can do that. Mark seam
and you can just clear out the seams
over here
and add, you know, more seams and then
add seams over here. Control E, mark
seam. Get rid of that. So that
definitely looks a lot better. They
actually seem to do the inner one
consistently, which is nice. And then
same if you want to polish up this side
as well, you can totally do that. Is it
necessary? You know, is it necessary?
Again, probably not. But, you know, if
you want to be clean, you can totally do
that.
Then maybe we can just clean it up just
a little bit more. And then maybe we can
clean this up just a little bit more.
And then we can keep this consistent.
And then we can keep this consistent
along the outer edge.
Mark seam
Q clear seam. Q clear seam. You know,
sometimes it might be better just to
start from scratch then update the one
that UV unwrap gives us, but sometimes
it's just fun just to have some fun if
that makes sense. So here I'm just
polishing up the corners. Just holding
control, getting rid of them. Ctrl + E,
mark seam. Looks a little bit better
here. This one is also not consistent.
And then here you can see that this
isn't consistent either. Yeah. So, if
you want to polish them up, you totally
can, but you know, not really a big deal
for us. Now, it might be worth
straightening these out with UV squares,
but we can actually determine that later
once we start baking. So, I did some a
little bit more unwrapping, but
honestly, there's nothing really new at
this point that you can't already do on
your own. So, I kind of just want to
give you a little bit more tips and
tricks and then let you go and unwrap
your scene yourself. Now, if you have
all the same UV map, so all of these
objects have the simple bake here. I'm
going to be using a simple bake add-on
just because it's a lot faster. It's
paid and it's $8, but when we bake, I'm
going to be doing it the free way. I'm
just doing it this because I'm going to
be using this in the future. But don't
worry, you know, when we do it, we're
going to do it completely free natively
in Blender. With this one, which is
appropriately unwrapped, we can do Ctrl
L and copy UV maps. And you can see even
though these are distorted, they have
the same geometry and the copying the UV
map works. So instead, so we don't have
to do anything. And now we can just hit
A and then hit A here. Q seams from
islands. And you can see all the seams
are going to transfer from there. And uh
yeah, definitely, you know, if you don't
if you already applied your modifiers or
don't have a modifier one, definitely
definitely save your time with copy EV
maps. You can see all these have
different distortions and everything,
but they have the same geometry, so they
all work. Q seams from islands. You can
see I just applied them all just like
that. So I don't have to manually select
every single one. I know there are
add-ons that if you have the same
geometry like this leaf, then you
wouldn't have to select the geometry on
this leaf as well, which speeds up your
workflow even faster. But again, I'm not
going to be using paid on. So the second
tip I'll show you is that we talked
about our subdivided cubes. You know how
we unwrap Mr. Rabbit kind of like this?
Well, that's kind of how I did almost
every single thing that was a subdivided
cube at one point. You can see I just
take the top. I find where the middle
comes to this diagonal sort of corner
and then I just cut it there and I do it
on both sides. Same thing over here. You
can also see that for the microphone
here. These were subdivided cubes. So, I
just cut it like so. And of course, I
deleted some extra faces over there. And
every time I follow this method, I get
very, very good unwraps, minimal
distortion, and seemingly equal tixel
density. So that even goes for these. So
these were extruded cubes. Like I had a
cube over here and I just extruded this
way and extruded this way and then added
a subdivision surface. So applied it.
You can see that we kind of have the
same pattern over here. So what I did is
I just find these find where they
connect to their to the other one. For
example, on this side, let me just go
into local view here like so. And
basically I'm just finding the areas
that have the diagonal and connecting
those up
right here. So we got square square over
there. Control E mark seam. And now if I
just give this a material that we can
see that thing on. You can see that we
get a great unwrap here. Minimal
distortion and equal texo density all
just by following the same exact method.
And that's exactly the same method
actually when we used our iPhone. Same
thing when I used my flower, the flower
center over here. Same thing with the
basket itself. This is also a subdivided
cube. I did cut out these extrudes, but
you can see the general shape of the
subdivided cube is still the same. I
just found that edge, found the corner,
and cut it out just like that. So,
another really quick tip and trick and I
guess intuitive idea is in instead of
cutting it like this for subdivision
surface cubes because they're so quick
together, you could easily just get
array with a slice down the middle like
here or here. Control E mark seam. And
if you take a look, that is actually
very very good for what we're going for.
It maximizes texture space and there's
minimal distortion. You can ignore that
because I didn't put seams on those.
Now, logically, how does this make any
sense? Well, think about if you had a
regular cylinder. So, let me just add a
cylinder real quick and just let me add
a loop cut here and then unwrap it. And
I'm just going to use conformal. And let
me just delete the top and bottom faces
and only focus on this area right here.
So, if you can imagine this, this and
this is exactly just like the cylinder.
Then that means we can just add a seam
down the center. So, let's just do that.
Ctrl E mark seam. And now take a look at
how we are unwrapping. So essentially
what it's doing is taking all these
faces and pressing them down. Now in
real life that would be impossible
without ripping the paper. So there's a
lot of stretching here. But because we
subdivided something so many times like
this, there's actually so many faces
that when you push it down, it doesn't
actually really matter anymore. Look how
squashed it is together. So imagine if
you had one piece of paper or one half
of paper that kind of looked like this
and they just asked you to push it down
flat on the ground. Well, it would
actually be really easy, right? You can
imagine like this would scale up this
way until it goes flat. And this one
would also scale up until it goes flat
as well if you like push from this side
downwards. And we can visualize that
with the cylinder. If I add let's say I
don't know like five loop cuts, I don't
know that might have been six. I'll just
type six like so. And now I hit you
conformal. Take a look at what happens.
The ring becomes less of an issue. So if
I do it again, I'm going to subdivide
and again and then I do conformal. So
now take a look. You can actually see
that we have solid blue faces along a
lot portion of the cylinder. And that
makes intuitive sense because if we push
down on one of these, we have so many
faces that the stretching is being
miticated by all those faces. So that's
kind of like the same idea that we have
over here, which is why we can just cut
over here and be perfectly fine. So you
know, if you just want to be speedy, you
can just, you know, do something like
that. Same thing with here. Ctrl E mark
seam just like that. And you'll get a
pretty good unwrap for what you're going
for. it'll pack well and it has even
texo density. So that's exactly what I
did for the plants here, these are also
subdivided cubes, but instead of cutting
it with the diagonals, I just went with
cutting it slight right down the center
middle. Additionally, I'll also say when
it comes to subdivided cubes, I did make
quite a few topology errors here. So
generally, you know, you don't want you
want to work in quads, yes, but you also
want to work in things that kind of have
the same size across your object unless
there's like more detail in certain
areas. But in this case, you can see
that I have multiple faces that are very
different sizes across the object and
it's not very ideal. So because the
topology is not really ideal, the unwrap
isn't really ideal either. You know,
these seams, while they are, you know, a
subdivided cube, they're in really
awkward sort of positions. So in this
case, the bad modeling led to a bad
unwrap. For us, it doesn't really
matter. So I'm not going to bother
fixing it. But just something to note.
That is also why I made this over here.
And here I changed this to arc, right?
So if I apply this, you can see that the
topology here definitely looks a lot
better than what we did than what I
accidentally did over here. Here I
didn't use arc. So you can see that the
bevel looks like this. And it's a little
bit messy here. Now, it didn't really
end up affecting the unwrap, but you
know, going for the arc would have been
definitely easier to unwrap and it
wouldn't have been as distorted along
the corners, but again, not really a big
deal. You can see that I also for the
legs here, I didn't use arc. So, we also
have that messed up topology here.
Again, not really a big deal, but you
know, ideally, you would want to use arc
in the future. So, when it comes to the
wheels, you can see I also did that half
cut method here, just like on the
leaves. For the wheels, they're just
cylinders. So, I cut them like
cylinders, right? I just cut them over
here and then just slashed on the edge
there. So, you can see decent unwrap
over here. For this middle thing, you
can see, oh, it's just a cylinder. So, I
just gave it one slash over there. For
the computer, I just used smart UV
project. It did a fairly decent job for
me, so I didn't really touch that at
all. It's a little bit messed up as you
can see, but, you know, I just wanted to
save some time there. Again, this is all
subdivision cube. So, it's all all of
these unwraps were identical just in
different shapes and things like that.
Another quick tip is if you can't select
by area like we did for the piano, you
can just go into local view, go into
wireframe, and just box select like
this. Hold shift box select like this.
And then you have, you know, those faces
selected if you want them. And then
control E mark just like that. Another
trick, definitely use ctr L, cr I and H
very, very frequently, especially if
your objects are joined. Like here, I
accidentally joined them early. So it's
like, okay, how do I even see what I'm
looking at? You could probably do like
something like this, you know, and just
like select it, Ctrl+, hide this, or,
you know, instead what you can do is
just like we did for the piano, select
the individual object, Ctrl L. So now I
have seams. So just it would select the
entire thing without seams. But I just
do Ctrl+ instead, then Ctrl I, then
hide. And now you can just have these
two unwrap yourself. And then of course,
Alt H to get them back, just like so. So
for all the hanging wires and those
curves that we converted to meshes, all
of them are just cylinders basically. So
that's kind of all I did. I just deleted
the two caps and then sliced it down
along the center. So just using control.
And if you accidentally mis select the
control and see like a zigzag, just undo
and just do it again until you get it
right. And then if it's a little bit too
long, I just cut it in half over here.
So that's why I have this seam here. And
you can see just like that, it cut the
wire into half and it packs fairly well.
It looks really good. Another tip, if
you are selecting a bunch of things, I
guess I should have mentioned it way
earlier in the video, even modeling, if
you select a bunch of things and
accidentally mess up your selection,
just hit Ctrl +- Z. And if you
accidentally get rid of your selection,
just hit Z. It will go back to your
original selection, so you don't have to
select everything over again. So,
another quick tip for copying your UV
maps. Instead of typing this every
single time, double clicking and typing
it for every single object. All you have
to do is just Ctrl + C and then on the
new object, just create a new one and do
Ctrl +V and it will just paste the name
right there. You don't even have to
double click. It'll just rename it for
you and it won't replace your original
one. So, it'll just change the name
itself. So, you can see I still have
everything retained there. So before we
move on to baking, why don't we render
out an image that we can share with our
friends. So again, if you don't have a
camera, so if you don't have a camera,
just add a camera and then find a place
you like and then Ctrl Alt numpad zero
just to snap your camera to view. And
then you can make sure to select your
camera and then just GG to move it into
position. You can see that on my camera
I'm using orthographic. You know, feel
free to use perspective and, you know,
do multiple angle renders if you want to
as well. I'm just going to be doing an
orthographic view. Just frame it like
so. Let's go into rendered view. And
let's find our unwrap collection and
just turn that back on. All right, cool.
So, now we can just frame this up. By
the way, if you want a render region,
you can do Ctrl +B. And that's why mine
is limited. And if you also want to see
that, you can come over into scene and
you can click render region and things
like that. So, in here, I'm going to
keep it at 20480 by 2480. But, you know,
if you want to change your picture
resolution, you can totally do that.
Like 10 1920 x 1080, you know, refframe,
whatever you want to do. I'm just going
to go for 20480. The render settings.
Now, we can come over here. Again, make
sure you're in cycles. Then, under
render, we want a very low noise. So,
this should be good. 256 might be a
little bit overkill, so we can just
divide by two. We probably wouldn't
notice anything as well. And then we
want to d noiseise the image. So, D
noiseis, I'm putting it high. And then
I'm using my GPU. If you want to
optimize it a little bit, you can come
into light pass and then change the
amount of how many bounces for lights.
So you can put that down like eight.
Honestly, you can probably put it down
to six and have it work fine. And for
performance here, you can also come down
to memory and do use tiling. And
basically what use tiling will do is
it'll render your image in chunks. So
instead of going like one at a time, and
this will usually be faster. So I like
to do 256 x 256 chunks. But, you know,
if your computer's good, you probably
don't have to do that anyway. So, now
that it's good, let's just go into
wireframe. It's quote unquote supposed
to make your computer a little bit less
taxing when you render if you have your
viewport in wireframe. That's probably a
marginally minuscule amount, but you
know, whatever. So, we're just going to
hit F12. And now you can see it's going
in 256 chunks across my 20480x 20480
picture. Seems like it's done. We can
just do image, save as, and save it
whatever you want to do it. All right.
When it comes to baking, like I showed
earlier when we were looking at some
award-winning websites, we need to put
our shared UV map onto a single image
texture. So, we can actually create
that. So, just like this texture over
here, we can actually start deleting
these if you don't want them anymore.
And also, when I go back in solid view,
I'm going to go over here and instead of
using texture, I'm going to go to
material again. Back to default.
Everything seems a little bit weird now
cuz we've been looking at grids for so
long. So now what we want to do is you
can create it in the material, any
material you want, or you can come into
the UV editor and just create it here.
So I'm going to create it over here in
the UV editor. We're going to go for 4K.
Click and drag my mouse down. 1024 * 4
4K texture. And we'll just call this
texture set one, but you know, name it
whatever you want. I honestly don't
know. And then we want to do 32-bit
float. This will just make a more high
dynamic range image so we get better
colors. We're not going to be baking
anything with transparency because I
don't have transparency anyway here
except the glass, but we're replacing
the glass, which I'll talk about just in
a little bit. So, let's uncheck alpha.
Now, when you're baking with color,
sometimes the image texture color bleeds
into the model itself. Not always, and
honestly, it doesn't really matter that
much, but I like to go for white. And
I'm just going to create a new image
just like that. Make sure to alt s and
save this somewhere. And when you save
it, save it as a radiance HDR image. And
this will just be an image format that
captures a wider range amount of colors.
If we bake in like PNG or JPEG or some
other lower bit image format, it won't
capture as many good colors. Now, it
might not be noticeable, but typically
if you want the best result, you'll go
for like a high dynamic range and then
later you can convert it down here. So,
basically, you have more information and
then you go to lower information, which
is a much better result than, you know,
starting at lower information if that
makes sense. So we're going to start
with this. We can just save this image.
Okay. So this is going to be our first
texture set that we bake to. So we can
select I don't know any random object
maybe like these or something. Again
make sure they all have simple bake and
all those ones that are highlighted. It
doesn't really matter which one is being
rendered because we don't use the UV map
for anything. But as just make sure that
this is highlighted like so. So now what
we can do is again you can select each
individual one. So you can just do the
Ctrl+ select all these set of UVs and
just see what that looks like here.
Now's the time where you move around.
You know, you can select all UVs and
just kind of move them around. See what
it gets you. Just like so. And now what
your goal is to do is to pack your
islands. So adjust them how you need and
optimize them to in your island. And
it's kind of just like that. And it's
just like that. So if you want, you can
move individual faces if you want. You
know, you can move individual faces.
Ctrl L move individual things and just
pack it to the best that you can. And of
course, you don't want overlapping UVs
because we're trying to bake lighting
information. And if you have overlapping
UVs, you know, it's going to bake twice
over the same spot and kind of glitch
out. The entire goal now is just to pack
the island. Now, obviously, if you do
this manually, it will take a really
long time for our scene. So generally
what you like to do is assuming you all
use the same UV mapping method. If you
did anglebased for some, conformal for
others or minimum stretch for others,
just make sure you remember that when
you're unwrapping. Again, I used
conformal for everything. But for these
more organic models, like these for
example, you might get slightly better
results with like minimum stretch, but
honestly, they haven't been noticeable
for me. Anyway, let's go here and we can
just do U unwrap and do conformal. and
I'll try and pack it for us. Now, what
this suggests is that, okay, we can add
a lot more objects to the scene, which
is great. And if you want to actually
pack it a little bit better, you can go
into UV and see this thing here called
pack islands. And then if you hit pack,
you can see it definitely uses a lot
more texture space now, you know,
maximizing the amount of resolution for
each area. And then, of course, the
sizing is relative to how big it is
relative to all the other objects on the
scene. So, the larger objects are
definitely taking up more area on the
space. Now, this is also the time to
determine how much texo density you
actually want on each face. So, this
might be more clear on like this piano
for example. So, if I just take it, move
it over here like so. Right now, if I
select this side of the face, it has the
same sort of mapping as this side of the
face. But the issue is this side of the
face will rarely be looked at, if looked
at at all. I don't know. Maybe I could
delete that. I don't know. But assuming
you'll see a little bit of it, you could
actually make this face a lot smaller on
the UV map and then repack it. You lower
the resolution of that face. Well, that
means you can actually increase the
resolution of this place because now you
have more space on your texture.
Obviously, you'd have to move things
around, but you get the idea. So, here's
also the time where you can like
determine that. Now, obviously, that
takes a lot of time. So, would I even
bother for this scene? Probably not
because we're working with solid colors.
But if you do notice an issue and you do
want to make that trade-off, you can
totally do that. Also, a lot of other
options here, but they haven't been
working really great for me. In some
cases, they might work like average
island scale and minimize stretch. You
could totally try these out, but
typically paid add-ons do this a lot
better than Blender natively. So, one
that I really recommend, it's $39, but
it saves you a lot of time, is UV
Packmaster. So, you can see if I do, let
me just do the Blender pack first. So
here you can see I did the blender pack
and honestly it did a fairly good job.
Now you can see there's still some extra
stuff over here. But look what happens
when I do the UV packmaster pack. It
gets very very much more texture space
out of there. You'll see that it also
has a lot of lot of other options here.
One of them is important is margin which
is also in Blender by the way and that's
how much space is between your islands.
And you need space between there because
when you bake, sometimes it bleeds
outside of these lines. So those can
overlap. And additionally, if they're
like touching each other or on top of
each other, your colors are going to
start mixing and one texture might
appear on a different area of the model
that isn't intending to have that color
at all. So let's go back to these over
here and let's just go into edit mode
and let's just bake these. So the way to
bake them is for every single material
you have to create an image texture and
you have to make sure it's the active
one for the texture that you're baking
to. So here we can just search for
texture set one and we don't have to do
anything you know just make sure it's
highlighted outline. So now it's in this
room here. So it's going to bake onto
this texture like so. Then we come into
render properties like we did before.
And we can leave all of these the same
as our image. Low noise 128 samples.
However, we want to uncheck D noiseis
here. The reason we want to uncheck D
noiseis here is because Blender has a
baking issue in cycles when you have D
noiseis on. And you can see over here
when you are baking, you might get like
these black sort of lines here. And
that's caused by if you have D noiseis
activated. And this was open 4 years ago
and it's still open, which means they're
working on it. And you can kind of see
like someone suggested something 3
months ago. It's still an ongoing issue.
So if you bake in cycles with D noiseis
on, you might get some black lines along
your seams. So I'm going to check here
and we'll use the Blender compositor to
D noiseis our image instead. So under
bake, you know, we can do everything. So
combined takes into consideration
everything. So we're just going to leave
everything here, all the lightings, all
the contributions, everything like so.
Now, we don't want to clear the image
before every bake. If you do, then you
can just attach that, but we don't
because we're going to be baking
multiple things to it. But if you mess
up a bake and you want to clear the
image, you know, you can totally just do
clear image. And here, this by default
is just like how much it bleeds across
the seams of your UV islands. That way
it'll kind of help, you know, minimize
how visible your seams are. And
generally 16, the default, works
perfectly fine. I don't think I've ever
had to change that in in a long time.
Again, make sure this is active. And
make sure that simple bake is and make
sure your baking UV map is the one
that's highlighted. Mine's called simple
bake. yours is just called whatever. Oh,
and I also forgot to mention like in
every single material that your room
has, you want to copy and paste the
image texture. So, in wood, also paste
this here. Make sure it's active. In
outlet, also post it here. Anywhere,
make sure it's active with the white
outline. Okay. Now that each of the
rooms materials has this active image
texture, we should be able to good and
just bake.
Awesome. So, just make sure to hit alt s
to save it. And you hit alt r to refresh
your image. Just like so. And now if I
go into rendered view and then if I go
here and put this into my principled
BSDF, we see completely black. And
that's because what we're doing is
rendering with this one. So switch the
render to here. And now you can see what
we get if I go into render view is our
image texture mapping to this. So let's
just go into local view. And you can see
that we see here. And take a look. All
those seams that we thought were going
to be concerns are actually not really
visible in the final output, which is
amazing. Now you can see all that grain.
So that's the noise on the texture,
which we can d noiseise with the
compositor later. For all intended
purposes, this is actually looking like
a pretty decent result. Now, because
it's in the principled BSDF, the world
lighting is also going to affect this
lighting. So pretty pretty cool. So
let's move on to the roof then. So, I'm
just going to unhook that. Put this back
in here. Switch this back to UV map. Not
that that actually affected anything
because we didn't use our UV map for
anything. And now I'm just going to go
out of local view. And we do the same
exact thing for this. Just make sure for
all the materials in this object, which
is just wood. This is active. And it's
already unwrapped and mapped to our
texture right here. Just like this. So,
we can just go here and then we can hit
bake. And then let's go into wireframe.
Now here you can see when I baked I made
two issues. First I had clear image on
for some reason. I thought I unchecked
that. Oh well. So it cleared my other
bake. The second issue is that
everything on my texture is black which
suggests that my normals are incorrect.
So if I go here indeed this is
incorrect. So I just have to select
everything al flip. And now everything
should be okay. And we should be able to
bake two things at once just by
selecting them. So we can just do that
and just do bake. Awesome. And you can
see that everything baked properly.
That's super super cool. And again, if
you want to preview it, you kind of
already know how to do that. So, I'm not
going to show you anymore. Again, always
make sure to hit alt s to save it. Or if
you want to version, you can do image
and save as or save a copy, whatever.
You'll also notice now again, we get
some things like here. So, this kind of
suggests that something is blocking the
light and we have probably an extra face
that we don't need somewhere. So, if I
go into my room, it kind of looks like
there's some sort of light leaking in
here. And that kind of suggests that
it's right here. So, if I go into
rendered view and just hide this,
indeed, we kind of have like this face
here that no one really sees and it
takes a huge portion of our texture. So,
what are we going to do? Are we going to
lower it and then re-ake it so it takes
less resolution, but it still exists? Or
are we just going to delete it and hope
no one can tell? Okay, so let's take a
look at what it would look like if we
didn't have this. So, let's go into
render view. Now, this is what it looks
like if the floor is there. Now, let's
hide this and let's go into edit mode
and let's delete this face. Now, let's
alt h just to get this back. Will people
notice from a distance? From close, they
can definitely tell that there is
nothing there. But from far away, can
people tell? And the answer is probably
no. Which means we don't actually need
that face taking up this sort of texture
space here. We can actually just leave
it deleted. So, if you unwrap and pack
again, it'll probably be different now
that this face is gone. So, if you have
a different packing, you'd have to clear
your image or create a new image texture
if you wanted to do that way. But, if
you had the same UV mapping on your
texture, you could just bake right over
the existing colors and it would just
replace them. But since our unwrap is
likely going to be different now, if I
do UV unwrap conformal UV packs,
you can see the pack is definitely
different here. And of course, if you're
packing manually, you know, it's
definitely going to look different. So
here you can see this takes a larger
portion now. Same with over here because
we have more texture space to pack. So
you can bake in portions like you can
bake these two first and then with your
remaining texture space, you can maybe
tack this on over here and then like put
it over here and kind of just see, you
know, where you can fit it. Like here
for example, you're like, ""Oh, okay. I'm
just going to select this, you know,
Ctrl+, select all these, move it over
here, like here. And then with this
material, you know, you have your stone
wall material. You just make sure this
is active in your stone wall as well,
like over here. Make sure it's active.
And then with this selected, you can
just bake it onto your pre-existing map,
assuming you know you baked these
already and they're in this format. So
you can bake multiple at a time. You can
bake one at a time. You can pack
manually or you can pack with UV
packmaster. So again, I'll show you
that. And you can see it definitely
packs a lot better. So you kind of have
a lot of options here. Don't worry about
getting perfect packs. Don't worry about
anything, honestly. As long as it looks
good, that's all you kind of have to
worry about, you know, when you're just
starting out, you know, just have fun.
Okay. Now, I kind of just want to talk
about a few more concepts when it comes
to baking. So the first thing is if you
plan to animate something for example
like this coffee and have it grow from a
scale of zero to a scale of one like so.
If you bake with the coffee mug active
like this all the objects that you're
baking will have the coffee mug shadow
here. So that would look really awkward
when you're animating from zero because
the coffee mug doesn't exist yet but
there's still a shadow appearing because
the image is baked on there. So that
means when you're baking like this or
this, what you want to do when you're
baking these objects specifically is
hide the coffee mug during render. You
can see this icon right here. If you
hide it, it will still appear in your
render. So if you want, you can just do
both of them so it's clear like that.
But definitely make sure the camera is
off. So when you bake, you want to
disable the render here. Now obviously
the downside for that is then you don't
have a shadow there. So when the coffee
mug comes back, there is no shadow here
on the texture. So, you wouldn't have a
shadow there. Now, again, like we looked
at the other award-winning websites,
that might not be noticeable. Even
though everything else has a shadow,
this might not have a shadow, but you
know, people might not actually even pay
attention to that. So, here you kind of
have those trade-offs. Of course, you
can always use a light with a bake
texture to cast a shadow, but we are
trying to avoid real-time lighting. And
you might be saying, well, that kind of
defeats the purpose of why we're baking.
But, but sometimes, a lot of times, you
combine real-time lighting in 3GS with
baked textures. for us. Yes, I feel like
that would be defeating the purpose of
why we're baking in the first place. So,
you could definitely do that approach if
you wanted to. Or what you could do is
like simulate a shadow, not necessarily
the same shape as this mug, but like a
plane that looks like that has like a
shadow image texture. And this is a
really common method for faking shadows
because here here you can see it's kind
of like a oval. So, if you like have an
oval plane with a shadow texture, you
could simulate a shadow for it as it
grows up. You could like scale up the
plane as well. That's just something to
consider if you are planning to animate
your individual objects. Another thing I
want to mention is with the glass, these
are also targets. So I I moved this into
my targets here. Same thing with this.
Actually, I haven't split this one up
yet. So let me do that real quick. I'm
going to select the glass of here of
this computer. I'm going to P separate
by selection and I'm going to move this
into my targets. Again, these are the
things that we're going to target. Same
thing with here. We can also move this
to target. So the screen I'll target
this is computer glass. Computer glass.
And this is fish bowl glass. So these
are things that we're not going to be
baking. So when you unwrap, you know,
don't put these UVs inside your image
texture. It'll just take up space. If
you accidentally do it, it's fine. I
mean, it'll just waste texture space,
but whatever. Now, when you're baking,
do you want to disable them from render?
So when you're baking, should you get
rid of them? Well, you can see they
actually contribute a lot of things to
your scene, like the shadow here. So, if
I disabled this in render view, you can
see I would lose some of the shadow that
the bowl's giving and the reflection on
the glass might adjust the light in
subtle ways along your scene. It might
honestly it might not be noticeable at
all, but yeah. So, I would probably
render with the glass still enabled.
Just don't put that on your unwrapped
texture. And then this water is just a
transparent color. So, I'm actually also
going to move that to targets. All
right. So, now you can just organize
things. If you want to categorize your
textures, like one is room elements, if
one is desktop items, you know, you do
you. And I will see you on the other
side. All right. So, I finished baking
and I got rid of all my collections and
just put them into into four different
collections. Each of these collections
are associated with their own specific
texture. So, I had four, but after
baking, I realized I only I only needed
two. But oh well, you know, four is
fine. You live and learn. It's
definitely going to increase the load
time, but you know, it's fine. So now
what you should have is a bunch of baked
textures. So I have eight here because I
also changed my lighting and baked
nighttime as well. So you can do that as
well if you want to. So now what we need
to do is go to the compositing tab and
dn noiseise our image. So if I shift A
and search for an image texture and we
want to and we want to navigate to one
of these like this one right here, you
can see it's got really a bunch of noise
and grain on there. So we can do the d
noiseise like so. Plug our image into
the dinoiser our dino noiser into the
compositor and over here just hit mute
this. This is the thing that renders our
camera. So we want to render an image
instead which you can come over here
render render image or just hit f12. But
before you do that you need to make sure
that under output properties your
resolution is the same as your image
texture. So if you did a 2K make sure to
change this to 2040. I did 4K, so I'm
going to leave it at 4096. And
everything should be good to go. And
I'll just hit F12. And you can see all
that noise is gone. And the color space
has adjusted to the one that we see in
Blender. Cool. We'll just use image,
save as, and I'll just leave it as PNG.
We don't have any alpha channels, so we
can just do RGB. We will be changing
this format later anyway, so we can just
save as this for now. Okay. Just repeat
the process with all your other
textures, and I'll see you on the other
side. Okay, now's the time to save
incremental. Save a completely new file
or duplicate everything, you know, up to
you. I like to just file, save
incremental. So, I have a completely new
file in case I mess something up. And we
don't need the UV editor anymore. And
we'll leave the shader tab open for a
little bit. Okay. So, the first thing I
want to do is adjust origin points and
join objects together if you haven't
done that already. So, for example, I
don't really plan on animating any of
these because I baked them baked the
shadow in with them. So, I'm just going
to join everything that I'm not planning
to animate. I'm just going to be joining
them all together just because it'll
save on draw calls. If you don't know
what those are, that's totally okay. It
doesn't really matter. I'm just going to
join it with the room itself. So, you
can see I just call that cube. Now is
also the time if you want to rename
stuff, you can also rename stuff as
well. So, I'm just going to go here. I'm
going to Ctrl J. I'm just doing Ctrl +
J. And maybe it's better if I do this in
solid view. So, let's just see. I'm not
animating this. I'm not going to animate
this. I'm not going to animate this. I'm
not going to animate this. Uh, I'm not
going to animate this. And not going to
animate this. So, I'll just join that
all. So, I'll just join everything with
the rim here. Just like this. Ctrl J.
And then what is this? Okay, I'll also
just Ctrl J and join with the room. So,
my first texture set is actually just
one object because I'm not animating any
of these, which is awesome. So, now what
we can do is get rid of the original UV
map because remember simple bake is the
UV map that's mapping to our texture.
So, we can get rid of this and then we
can create a new one called first
texture set.
And let's just make sure this works. So,
so we'll just search for an image
texture just like so. Open it up.
Navigate to your first one or whatever
one you created. And you can just plug
it in just like that. It'll look a
little bit off, but you know that's
fine. Just make sure just make sure
nothing looks suspicious. So you can go
in local view, of course, and just
inspect it. Look for seams. Look for
lines that don't really make any sense.
And if you have to re-ake things, you
know, you can totally do that if you
want. So I don't see anything
particularly noticeable, but you know,
if you do see some sort of line or some
sort of issue, you know, don't be afraid
to just go back into the UV editor.
Let's see. a UV editor and open your
image texture. So, this one is called
first texture set day. And let's say you
have like a small black line, you know,
don't be afraid to just like move it
just a little bit. And like I showed
earlier in the video, it might mess up
the colors, but a lot of times it might
not mess up the colors. So, don't be
afraid to do that if you notice
something. Again, if you are familiar
with Photoshop or some other photo
editing software, yes, you can like
paint on here or fix up the color. Use
like AI autocorrection to fix up, you
know, certain lines and areas like that
if you want to. But for the most part,
this looks good to me. So, we don't
really have to touch anything. And yes,
I forgot to delete the faces back there,
which I can actually do now before we
export. Like, yeah, I'm wasting space on
my image texture, but we could also
delete the geometry, but honestly, I'll
just leave it in there because it's
there. disable deselect for first
texture set and reenable for the second
texture set. And I don't think I'm going
to animate any of these. So I'm just
going to hit Ctrl + J to join them
statically. Okay. So in this second
texture set, you'll notice that I have
three spheres here. And these I just
added and I did not put them as part of
the bake, but these are targets that I
will be targeting. So I'm going to
actually just move them into our targets
class and rename them to like fish and
then rename it to like fish. fish bubble
one or something like that and fish
bubble two and so on and so forth. That
way I can easily target it in code and
you know know what it is later. So I
guess in the end my second texture set
is only one of these. If you want to you
can create you know get rid of all these
materials and you know create a second
texture set and hook it up just if you
want to validate that it works. So we
just did that. So second texture set. Of
course, this is optional or if your
workflow wants you to import the image
with the model, but again, we're keeping
it separate. So, here, actually, this
actually kind of saved me a little bit
because I forgot to remove the UV map on
all of them. So, we get rid of it and
okay, everything works again. So, it's
really important that when you export,
this is the only one that you have when
you export. Continuing on in this
texture set, what I'm going to do is
animating the scale of these. So, I'm
actually going to leave them separate.
So, what I'm going to do is select all
of these. Hit Ctrl I, I believe, and hit
control I. And that'll select everything
else in my texture set that but nothing
else because I disabled the selection
for all my other collections, which is
great. And I don't plan on animating any
of these other ones. So, what I'm going
to do is just come over here and Ctrl J
and join them just together like that.
Now, the materials messed up because I
use generated coordinates, but again, we
don't even need materials at all. We
just need to get rid of the UV map here.
Leave simple bake. And we can just
actually get rid of all the materials.
Just like this. Again, we can do first
texture set. We can copy this. Change
this to third. This to third texture set
and just open our third texture. Same
thing for these. We can just get rid of
everything. We can change this to third
texture set. And then with this active,
we'll do CR Link materials. Now, it's
messed up because we still have UV map
here. So, let's get rid of UV map like
so.
And we still need to get rid of light
wooden on all of these as well.
And this one is
I didn't get I didn't get rid of the UV
map on that one. And this one I
accidentally got rid of the texture
instead of Okay, cool. So, everything
seems to be good. If I right click,
select objects. Yeah, everything seems
to be good in this one right here. So,
it seems like I still have smooth
shading modifiers, which is fine. I can
just convert that to mesh. I don't think
that'll actually make any difference.
So, anyway, I just converted it like so.
So, let's move on to the fourth texture
set. Now, since I'm going to be
animating these later, I'm going to move
that into my targets. So, I'm going to
call this my work button. This one I'm
going to call about button. About
button. This one I'll call contact
button. Contact button. And I'm going to
move these into my targets. And then I'm
also animating these. I don't really
know what to call this. So I'll just
call it hanging
blank one. Actually, let's use a number.
Hanging plank one. And then I'll call
this one hanging blank_2.
So I'll just move that into targets as
well. So, so far it seems like I moved
all my targets into targets and then
everything that I'm not targeting I just
joined together as a single object. So,
honestly, I'll just call this first and
I'll just call this second. If you want
semantic name, if you want semantic
names, you can totally do that. I'm just
going to do first, second, third. Okay,
for the fourth texture, let's see. I'm
going to probably animate the boba. So,
I'm just going to change that right now
with an underscore add plushy. put that
into targets. Let's see. I do plan to
animate these as well. So, I'm just
going to move that into targets as well.
Uh, actually, I do think I want to
animate this. So, I'm going to move that
into my targets collection. Cool. Just
like that. I don't think I'm animating
anything else. Again, if you do, then
you can leave them separate and move it
to targets. So, I'm just going to select
everything here. And I don't know, it
doesn't really matter which one. I'm
just going to select one of them, make
it active, and just Ctrl J and join
them. And then I'll just call this
fourth. Fourth like so. And if you want
to, you can get rid of all the
materials. So let's just for the sake of
completeness, let's just get rid of all
the materials on fourth. And let's just
do texture set.
Fourth. Of course, we can hook up our
fourth texture set just to see how it
looks.
Cool. And let's just get rid of our UV
map.
And again, you know, go and inspect it
for any flaws and any issues and to see
if you need to re-ake or delete
something and whatnot. Cool. Okay. So,
this is all I have. And then for my
targets, these are the things that I'm
going to be animating in code. So, if
you have a lot of them and you want to
do them in order, what I recommend is
giving some sort of ID like 1 2 3 4 5.
That way, you can just use like a loop
in Gap rather than having to manually
target each one. If you don't have an
ID, I mean you could probably select by
computer fan. So that is also
technically quote conet ID. You know,
you have a lot of different variety
methods, but you know, your naming
convention now kind of determines how
easy it will be for you to code later.
So, do you need a naming convention? No.
But it definitely speeds up your process
here. I think for me specifically for
this project, I don't think I will be
animating anything in specifically in
order. maybe the computer fans, but for
the rest of them, I think I'm just going
to do it manually. All right. And yes,
all the objects here still have their
materials. If you want to replace them
with their appropriate textures just to
check, you totally can. Again, just make
sure for the ones that are baked, you
get rid of UV map and just leave your
baking one. So, you might have named it
baking. I called it simple bake. Um, so
up to you. So, I'm just checking that
right now. So, screen, I didn't bake it,
so that's why it's just leaving that.
That's totally fine.
Twitter, I baked, so I'm going to get
rid of this. YouTube, I baked. I'm going
to get rid of this. So, let's see.
Screen, I didn't bake. GitHub, I baked.
Fishbubble, I didn't bake. Fishbowl
water, I did not bake. That's also going
to be a target. Glass, I did not bake.
Contact button, I already replaced. Uh,
so these are all baked. Cool. All of
those are baked. And then the ones that
I didn't bake, I just left the original
UV map there. And I almost forgot, but
now we want to check our origin points.
So this one, I think I'm going to scale
like this. So I'm just going to go into
edit mode and probably just move the
origin point here. So shift S, cursor to
selected, right click, right click, set
origin, origin to 3D cursor, just like
that. So this is kind of what I like
here. Let's see. This one, this one can
scale from this origin point, which is
okay. These
share the same origin point. These also
have their origin points in the center.
Let's see if that looks okay. So, scale
here. So, what I'm kind of envisioning
is this comes out, this comes down, and
then these kind of stagger and come out
a little bit delayed, but almost at the
same time. Same thing with these. So, I
wonder if I scale from here or if I
scale from the bottom instead. I think I
don't Let me check. What I can do is
just shift right click just to try it.
Hit period on my num key 3D cursor. It
would just go up here. And then we can
just see.
Yeah, I think I like the scaling coming
down from here instead of the center for
these. Again, that's kind of up to you.
If you want, we can probably just select
this. Shift S cursor to selected and
then right click, set origin origin to
3D cursor if you wanted to do that. Or
you can just eyeball it, honestly. Shift
right click somewhere. Right click, set
origin origin to 3D cursor. You know,
it'll probably be close enough. Same
thing over here. I'm just going to shift
right click arbitrarily. Let's go back
to bounty box center. Let's see.
Yeah, bow plushy is a little to the
left. So, I want to fix that. Let's go
into edit mode. This time I'm going to
Oh, I accidentally did not. Okay, this
is an issue. So, this just took up space
on my image texture. Could I rebake?
Absolutely. But then I have to repack
everything and bake everything again.
So, whoops. Oh well. But at least I can
delete the geometry. So, I'll save a
little bit of memory there. Anyway, uh
sorry. The reason I went in here is to
set the origin point. So, select that
edge loop there. Shift S cursor to
selected. Right. Go into object mode,
right click, set origin origin to 3D
cursor. Just like that. Cool. And that
looks nice. It's scaling just like that.
Cool. Cool. Cool. Now, actually, one
thing I want to do is honestly,
we probably should have done this before
I was moving things around, but I want
to give them the names for the textures
that they have right now. That way we
don't have to like manually set it
later.
Honestly, this is kind of optional step,
but you know, whatever. So, like you
know how these separate components are
all mapping to the third texture set?
Well, instead of like typing them in,
I'm just going to like filter in code
all the ones with the name of underscore
third. So, I'm just going to tack this
on to the end of everything that has
that maps to the third texture set. So,
I'm just going to go down and oh, I got
the rid of the material here. I think
this is texture set four. Okay, so this
is texture set four. So I'm just going
to call this fourth. So this is called
fourth, third, second, first. So I'm
just going to check if this exists in
the string because you know it's just a
string. So chair top this is over here.
And let's just take a guess. Maybe
texture set three. Okay, it's sorry I
said three but it's four. So it's going
to be fourth. Then YouTube, Twitter,
GitHub should be the same as Bobo
plushy. So I'm just going to confirm
that with CR Link materials. Yes, they
are. So I can just copy forth for these.
So for these I can do that Twitter,
YouTube. Okay. So So it seems like just
by coincidence the ones that I am
animating or interacting with like
having clickable just happen to be from
my third and fourth textures. I guess
that was just a coincidence. the ones
that aren't baked like my bubble or my
computer screen, I didn't have any sort
of ID for them underscore because there
is no texture to map to. So, I'll also
say if you want to create like hitbox
zones for objects, like let's say this
is your about me section and you want to
be able to click on there. If you don't
want to use the complicated mesh itself,
you can always make like a hitbox
geometry like this. Just make sure you
name it something like hitbox_about_me
or something like that. And you can just
make this invisible in 3GS, but still
clickable. So that means you would have
like a click zone over here. For the
navigation itself, I'm just going to use
their own original mesh. Yes, if you use
a less complicated mesh, performance
increases. However, this is a very
simple mesh. So the the difference in
performance is probably very very small.
So it's not worth creating hitboxes
here. But if you want to create hitboxes
for your things to ray cast and hit to
select later, you can totally do that.
Otherwise, I'm just going to be using
like the actual objects themselves to be
clicked on. All right. So, when you're
ready, you can just hit A to select
everything. This shows that these are
selected, but they're not because I
disabled selection for them. So, you
know, make sure you got everything. Be
super cool. Now, we can just do file
export glTF/GB.
Remember export settings so you don't
have to change it every single time.
Only limit to selected objects, right?
We don't want to export the lightning
camera and things like that. In our
mesh, UVs and normals, great. Material,
no export. We are not going to be
exporting our materials with our model.
Shape keys, we don't have any of those.
Armatures, none of those. Skinning, none
of those. This is okay. And we have no
animations. So, I'll just call it
room_folio,
but name it whatever you want. And I'm
just going to hit enter and enter. Just
like that, and save that. But if you are
curious and you just want to see how
things are, you can just hit A and
export it with the PNG materials. So,
all of these I have them with their PNG
materials. So, I can just do file export
like so. And then include what? Let's go
to data. Let's go to materials. Let's do
export. And I'm just going to export
this with materials underscore with
materials. Then we can just navigate to
gltf report. You can see it's right
here. Room profiler with materials. It's
really large. Now you can see what we
get. And everything seems to look good
except the ones that I'm replacing
later, like the glass and the water. But
for the most part, this looks pretty
good. So we can continue on with the
coding. All right. So I'm going to be
using Vit as our bundler. If you don't
know what a bundler is, basically it
just takes all our development sort of
things and compiles it down and
optimizes it for browser because the
browser can only read like HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, and web assembly. And
there's all these other different kinds
of development tools that help speed up
our development process. Bundlers do a
lot of other things as well, but that's
kind of like the general idea of why
we're using a bundler. So, I'm going to
use Vit because it's very, very quick to
set up and it works well for these kinds
of projects. So, here I just navigated
to my path. I'm just going to copy that.
I'm just going to CD just to go in
there. And then with this copied, let me
just copy that real quick. I'm just
going to paste it in here just like so.
So, I'm going to assume that you already
have Node installed or one of these like
bun or Yarn, you know, some sort of
package manager. I'm just going to be
using Node.js. Honestly, that doesn't
really matter for this tutorial as long
as you have some sort of package
manager. I'm going to call this room
portfolio, but name it whatever you
want. I'm just going to go for vanilla
JavaScript in this video and I'm just
going to go with vanilla JavaScript like
that. So, I'm going to go into that
directory or that folder that they
called me. I'm going to do npmi, which
will just install the dependencies
listed in the package.json, which we
can't see yet. And I'll just do code
dot. And if you have VS Code installed,
it will open your directory into VS
Code. So, here you can see that. And
then package.json. I just installed this
because this is the only thing in
package.json. So let's just run mpm
rundev to make sure this works. And
indeed it is working. Super super cool.
Just like that. Okay. So let's install
some dependencies that we definitely
need. So we might come back to this. So
I'm just going to do mpmi install for
SAS Gap and definitely 3GS. So I'm just
going to do all of them just like so.
Now let's get rid of counter. We don't
need this. Get rid of it. Actually we
can just delete it. I'm just going to
delete that. don't need this or this.
So, we can delete those. In main.js, we
can just get rid of everything here
except the import. We can leave this as
SCSS. And then we can rename this with
SCSS. So, I just hit F2. Same hotkey in
Blender as VS Code. And your folder
system actually, well, at least for
Windows here, we can just get rid of
everything. I don't think we really need
to touch anything here. So, let's just
get rid of that. Let's also do our
default reset. So,
so box sizing border box like so. M0 for
margin zero, P 0 for padding zero, just
like so. And we can just get rid of this
stuff. We'll come back to this in a
little bit. Now, in index.html, so I'm
just doing Ctrl P to quickly navigate to
search for files. And you don't actually
have to type it. You can just like type
arbitrary characters that you know are
inside. So, you don't even have to spell
it correctly. And you'll just jump to
that file. And here we want to create
our experience that just wraps our
canvas in case you know we need to work
with that. So, and inside we want our
canvas where our 3GS scene lives. And
I'll just call that experience canvas
just like so. Okay, let's set up our
folders. So, I like to do models. And I
also like to do well now since we have
textures, I'll do textures as well. So
basically the public folder is the
static folder asset that Vit will use to
know where to find their static assets.
If you change this from the root
directory or you change the name, you
will have to create a vit.config file
and adjust it there. But you know we
don't have to do that. So we can just
leave it as is. And then one I have like
one for images as well. We might come
back and add to this anyway. All right.
So before we put my our model in here
and our textures, I want to compress
them. That way it'll reduce on the load
time. So, one thing I like to do with my
model is go put it through Draco
compression, which is a really common
compression method. In the past, when
you export it from Blender, there used
to be a compression thing you could
check and it would do Draco compression
automatically, but for some reason, it's
been removed and I never bothered to
look up why. Anyway, that's fine because
we can use gltf report to compress our
model. There's a lot of other methods
which I cover in my Minecraft video
which you can check if you want to, but
we're just going to use this one. And
what we're going to do is come over down
under export here and change this to
Draco just like so. And then we don't
have to touch anything here. We can just
hit export and it'll download it for us.
And you can see it's only 1 megabyte
compared to our original one which is
12.5 kilobyt or sorry or 12 megabytes.
And you can see that, you know, it looks
identical. Super super cool. So we
should just be able to drag that in
there. I'm going to actually change this
to old. So, I'm just going to hit F2.
And I just want this one called room
portfolio. Cool. And I would just put
that into models. To compress our image
textures, I'm going to be using this
squish, which is made by Google. And
we're going to convert it to WEBP
because WEBP is optimized for the
browser. And it typically has the best
image quality to file size ratio. Not
always, but you know, typically. And we
don't need any other sort of format for
us. So, we're just going to be going for
WEBP. So, I'm just going to click and
drag there. I'm going to change this to
webp just like so. And then on the left,
you can see before and then on the right
you can see after. So, you can see it
definitely gets blurry over here. So,
make sure to just be aware of that. So,
I think I'm going to increase the
quality a little bit. Okay. Seems like
90% quality seems pretty good. From far
away, no changes, but like close away
even there was no changes. So, let's
just download that. You can see this is
only 732 kilobytes, whereas our original
one was 19 megabytes, which is kind of
crazy. All right, so just repeat that
with the other textures. I'm just going
to click and drag this here. If you want
to adjust the quality slider, or if you
just want to leave it at 90 and just do
it and be done with it, that's totally
fine as well. All right, so when you're
done compressing, you can just click and
drag your textures into textures right
here. And then maybe we can be a little
bit more organized. And I'll call this
room. Inside room, I'll do night. And
then I'll also click over here and do
day. And then all the day ones, I'm just
holding control to select every single
opposite one. Move it into day. And then
hold shift to select everything in
between. And then just move it into
night. And then additionally in
textures, we probably want a video
texture. So I'm just going to create a
video texture there. Sorry, a video
folder. And we'll put a video there in a
little bit. I know Blender also has this
option here called create WEBP when you
export. Honestly, I've never used it
before, but maybe that's like an
alternative if you want to. We could
have also saved our image instead of it
as PNG as a WEBP, but honestly, I've
never had the chance or bothered to try
it out. So, that actually might be a
faster solution if you wanted to look
into that. Okay, let's start going into
main.js and start setting up our 3GS
experience. So, I kind of explained it
really really in detail in my previous
video, so I'm going to try and rush
through this part of the setup, but you
know, more of just a refresher. So the
first thing I need is a canvas for my
renderer to target. So again, I'm just
going to use document duckquery
selector. And I'll just get my
experience canvas just like so. And it
was a class. So I'm going to put a dot
there. So semantically, it would make
sense if we also gave this an ID. So I'm
also going to do ID hashtag. Oh, sorry.
Not that's not a hashtag. That's a
quote. And then I'll just copy and paste
this in here just like so. And then we
can just do hashtag here now. Cool. Then
I'm going to just copy all of this stuff
to make it speed up a little bit. This
is from the getting started docs.
Creating a scene. So we can just paste
that in here just like so. Hold alt to
move this up. I want it at the top like
so. So we're just creating a scene that
we add stuff to. We're creating a
camera. Adding a cube and then animating
it. So this function I want to and I'll
be changing this one just because I like
looking at an arrow function better. So
I'll do const render equals arrow
function and let's move all this logic
into render and then let's just call
render down here. Then we need our
window.request animation frame so it
loops on every single frame and we just
want to pass in the render function. So
we call it once and then this will keep
on calling itself over and over again.
Okay, so let's update. We don't need to
append anything here. We don't need to
set the animation loop. And then I want
to store the sizes of the inner width
and inner height into a variable that we
update. So in the event that I want to
change it later. So I'm just going to
call that con sizes equals. And we'll
set the height height equals to
window.in
height inner height. And we'll set the
width equal to window.in width just like
so. Put a comma there. So now what we
can do is just control D select the next
instance of that. Backspace this out.
Let's call this width. And we need
sizes. So I'll do sizes do width. So
same thing with the height. Ctrl + D to
select the next instance height. And
let's just change this to sizes.ight.
Just like that. All right. So let's go
to style.css and let's make our canvas
full screen. So what I'm going to do is
go into my index.html folder just to
make sure. Okay. I caught it. We can I
guess we can also just change this to an
ID. And let's just Crl X to quickly
delete lines or cut lines. So I just do
experience like so. And I'll just do #
experience which is my div wrapper. I'll
make it fixed. I don't know if I want to
change that later at the time being. So
I'm just going to position fixed just
like so. Make its height take up the
full and the take up the full page just
like that. Top zero, left zero, doesn't
really matter here. And then we can just
overflow hidden everything just like so.
Now, if you're using normal CSS, yes, we
would put this outside like here and
target this experience dash canvas like
so. Now, since we're using SCSS, we can
actually have some visual idea. And it
can follow the same sort of hierarchy as
it does in our index HTML. And you can
leave it inside instead of outside. If
you want to leave it outside, that's
totally fine as well. I'm just going to
put it inside # experience. And then we
just want height and width 100% as well.
Okay, let's uh control W to close those
real quick. Let's go back to main.js.
And let's set up our renderer. So, it
needs our canvas that we passed in. So,
I'm just going to set that canvas to our
canvas that we created over here. And
then anti-alias to get rid of those
jaggedy lines. We're just going to set
that to true right now. Then, let's
adjust the pixel ratio. So, renderer set
pixel ratio math.mmin. So, I explained
this in my previous video. If you need
to look that up, you can totally do
that. But basically, it's just how many
pixels it takes to represent a certain
CSS pixel. And you generally don't need
more than two. Anything more would
probably be overkill and you know, take
performance when there's not much
difference. So, and of course, we need
to make it responsive because right now,
if I resize, nothing's going to adjust.
So, we know how to do that. But just a
refresher this time, we can add our
event listeners over here. event
listeners and I'll just do window
addeventlister and I'll call it
onresize. So every time this resizes
we're going to get an event. So what we
want to do is highlight sizes wwidth and
we want to update this to the new window
inner width and height. So I can post
that left arrow key to go there. Enter.
Backspace this out. Hold alt for two
cursors equals and window.in
oops inner width. And we can just change
this one over here to height just like
so. So we adjust to the new one every
single time. We need to update the
camera. So update camera. We need to
update the aspect ratio which is this
second parameter right here. So camera
aspect equals sizewidth divided by size
by height. Let's get rid of this right
here. And we need to update the
renderer. So let's just update the
render as well. Update renderer. We need
to update this. And yep, I almost
forgot. We need to call update
projection matrix in order for it to
actually update. And now you can see
that if I go back here, it's fully
responsive. Just like that. Super super
cool. Okay. So now I want orbit controls
so we can move around our scene.
Remember it's right click to pan, left
click to rotate around. So if we come to
the docs, we can see how to import orbit
controls. So I'm just going to import
that. I'm just going to go to the top of
my documentation. Just paste that there.
Sorry, I said documentation. I meant
doc. Then let's just copy this const
controls equals new orbit controls. And
let's just place that under our camera
over here. Just like so. Like so. We
don't need to place it here. We can just
put it over somewhere over here. Cool.
Let's just place our camera position
over here just so it's kind of grouped a
little bit. We'll move things around so
it's not that big of a deal. Like here.
Controls.date. And now you can see it
works. I can move around and so on so
forth. But this time I actually want
damping. I think in my previous video I
didn't use it. damping just makes it so
when you when you release your mouse it
still moves a little bit after it kind
of gives this smooth sort of effect. So
you can come to their code here you can
see it's just controls enamel damping
true and then some sort of damping
factor there that you can adjust to your
liking. So I'm just going to place that
right over here E just get rid of that
and that's also why we have
controls.update update in the render
loop this time as you can see from their
comment. And if you want to get here,
you can go to the GitHub open source
repos or in 3JS examples and then just
hit the code icon right here and I'll
navigate to this right here. Okay, let's
load our model. So, we're going to use a
gltf loader. But before that, we need to
set up a Draco loader which is located
in node modules under three. So, again,
this is just the entire GitHub repo
pretty much three. It should be under
examples JSM and then under libs you can
see this thing here called Draco. We
just want to Ctrl + C to copy this
entire folder. Close node modules folder
and right in public folder just paste it
right there. So here in the Draco folder
you can see that it's got like some
decoders encoders. So let's create our
loaders. I guess we can just put up here
with everything else. So I just call
this loaders. But before we create them
we need to import them. So if you come
to 3GS documentation, you can see how to
import them right here. So we're just
going to copy that for the Draco loader.
We can just import it just like that.
Texture loader by default seems to come
with the three node modules folder. So
we don't actually have to import
anything special there. However, for the
glTF loader, yes, we also have to import
something here. So we're just going to
import that just like so. Cool. So let's
create it. Again, we have our textures
that we need to load. So let's create
our const texture loader. texture loader
equals new 3 texture loader like so. And
this should be new. Sorry. Now, in order
to use the Draco loader, we need to set
the decoder path to that path that we
just created. So, we can just copy all
this stuff right here.
And let's just paste that in here. Get
rid of this. Now, we don't have to path
to it like so because we moved it into
our public folder. So, what we can do is
just do / draco slash just like so. We
need to use our gltf loader. So you can
see actually they showed us here as well
to set the Draco loader here. So let's
do it again. Const loader. So actually
let's do camelc case here. And I'm just
going to call this Draco loader like so.
And I'm just going to double click copy
and paste that like so. And then for
this one we can just leave I guess this
one as loader. So here I'm just going to
copy this. I guess we could have just
used this doc instead. Oh well whatever.
Uh let's just copy this. Crl X like
here. And then we're just setting the
Draco loader to the Draco loader that we
created. Model loaded loaders. Whoop. I
also misspelled this. So, let's just fix
that real quick. So, let's create some
uh let's create like a map. That way, we
have keys set to each of these because I
don't want to do the same thing twice.
So, let's just con texture map. And I'm
going to give the keys the same as the
ones in Blender, right? Underscore
third. So, it'll be third, fourth, and
then first, second, third, so on, and so
forth. So, we'll just do the same thing.
So, the keys for this object will be
first. And I'll have a day and night
version. If you don't have a night
version, that's fine. I'm just going to
have a night version as well. And then
we need our path pass into our texture
loader. So, we'll just navigate to the
path of this right here. Again, it's in
the public folder. So, we should just be
able to do texture/ room/day.
And we'll just call it first texture set
day.p.
I forgot a slash here. Copy and paste
this over here as well. Let's put some
quotes. And let's just change this to
night like so. And now let's just shift
alt down arrow. Let's change this to
second. Like so. We forgot the comma.
Whoops. Let's add a comma here. And
let's do that for third and fourth as
well. Third. Of course, organize it how
you split up your textures, but this is
how I did. And then I'll just select
this and do Ctrl D and change this to
second.
Do this same thing here. Crl + D. Change
this to third. Over here, change this to
fourth. Like so. Just the name of my
textures over here. I forgot to change
this one to night first. Whoops. That's
totally okay. We can just select that
and paste night. There we have an object
with all our paths that we can pass into
our texture loader. Now, let's store
them in another object when we're
loading them. So, let's create that
right now. This way, we can just easily
access them later. So, textures equals
day. And this will just be an object as
well. And night. So we can have an
object here. So this is the one for the
loader. And then this is the one after
they're done loading, we're going to put
it into this object here. Okay. So all
the 3JS texture loader really needs is
just a path. So that's all we're going
to do. And the way we're going to do
that is with object.ent entries. Just,
you know, some built-in JavaScript
function. Here you can see what it does.
It will split up each of these entries
into their key and to value. And here
they're just printing it out as a string
using a string literal which is why it's
appearing like this. But that means we
have a key. So what we would do instead
is our key would just be like first,
second, fourth and then our value would
just be our path. So let's go. We'll
just do object. entries entries and
we'll pass our texture map in there. And
then for each for each of the keys and
path of the keys and we can just call it
pass. Whoops. We can just call it pass.
They called it values. We'll just call
it pass. We're going to we're going to
load that specific texture. So, let's
see. I forgot a parenthesy here. And I
need another one over here just like so.
Okay, that's good. So, let's create
context texture equal to our texture
loader. And we just want to load pass
day. So, remember pass is the value. So,
so essentially what we get is this,
right? And then we're just doing dot
notation to access the day path. And
then we want to put in this. Oh, let's
call it loaded textures. Sorry. So
loaded textures day. So we're targeting
this object right here. And we want its
key and then we're going to create a key
and we're just going to set it equal to
day texture like so. Okay. So let's see
what we're doing with one iteration. Oh,
sorry. This should be key, not keys.
Let's see when we go through one
iteration what happens. So we come over
here, we target day, we get the path, we
pass it in, we load it up, and then we
set it into over here. And now if the
key does not exist in over here in this
object, it will create it for us. So
what happens through one first iteration
is they will have something like this
first and it will just be our day
texture like so. So this is our first
iteration what we get and then of course
you know as we repeat it's just going to
continue on. So this would be like first
day texture. This would be second day
texture and then this would be and then
this would be second and so on so forth.
And then we also want to do it for the
night as well. So if you want to if if
you want to confirm that you can just
print it out. Okay. So let's just do the
same thing for night as well. So let's
come over here. The same thing here.
Let's just do control d and just change
this to night. And now let's load the
gob model. So we can do loader.load. It
takes a path in the first you can see
right there URL. So again we just do
models. It should just be in /models.
Yeah. Okay. So /models
/roomportfolio.gb.
Let's grab that GB. So we'll just call
it GB. And on load, what are we going to
do? So this is the second parameter
here. So when once it's completed done
loading, this callback is going to be
triggered. So the first thing we want to
do then is to assign our objects those
image textures. The way to do that is
using GB is using the traverse method,
which we covered in the previous video,
but it just goes through your entire
GB's children and their childrens of
children. So let's just do GB scene dot
scene.t traverse and we'll just do child
like so. And if the child is a mesh, we
want to update its material. So is mesh
like so. And if it is, then we want to
loop through all our keys for the
texture map and check if the child name
contains that key because we named it in
Blender that way. So we can do that with
object.key keys. Again, this is a
built-in JavaScript function that
returns the keys of your object. So I
just do picture map. And then same thing
here for each of these keys. We're going
to check if the child.name doinccludes
includes the key inside the string and
if it does then we'll do create a new
material. So I'll just call it con
material new three dot mesh. We are not
we don't need any real-time lighting. So
we can use a mesh basic material and we
just map our loaded textures. So the
object that we created up here and by
default I want the day. So I'm just
going to hardcode day here. And then we
can just pass in the key which will be
first, second, third. And then we can
just set child domaterial
equal to that material.
Now, you don't have to create a variable
if you don't want to. I'm just doing it
for organizational purposes. And then,
of course, the last thing we have to do
when it's done loading. So, let's make
sure I get in here is to add it to the
scene. So, I'll just do scene add and GB
scene of our GB file. And then, whoops.
This should be key, not keys. If I go
back to the browser, this is what we
have. And it looks messed up, but it's
because Blender and 3GS uses a slightly
different coordinate system on terms of
their starting point of 0 0. So what we
need to do is for the textures
themselves, we'll just set them equal to
flip Y. Just do flip Y equal to false
like so. And then we can also do that
the night one. Again, if you don't have
a night one, that's totally okay as
well. Cool. Now it looks a little bit
washed off, and that's because we need
to set the color space of our texture.
So now what we can do is the texture
color space equals 3 sRGB color space
just like so. Same thing for the night
as well. And now you can see that it
looks exactly like it does in Blender.
So if you take a look at the
documentation by default the output
color space is 3 sRGB color space. So we
don't actually have to touch the
renderers one. Cool. Now, one thing you
will notice is take a look at Kirby over
here, or actually any any any seam that
you have on your on your object. You can
see that as I get farther and farther
away, the seams are becoming more and
more noticeable. Even though they don't
appear on my image texture at all, the
seams are still appearing. Now, that's
because of this thing called mip
mapping, which basically, you know,
tries to improve performance by reducing
image resolution, right? Because if
you're really far away, it's like why do
you need all that resolution? So, it'll
sample areas around your seams, right?
And since you have like since you have
like gaps between your seams, sometimes
it's just completely black, which is why
the seams will start appearing because
it's like sampling that black color
instead. So, what we can do to fix that
is actually change the way that 3GS
handles things. So, if you go into the
3GS documentation, you can see here that
it's about how the texture is sampled.
This is a little more complicating and
getting into the weeds of stuff, but
just to know that we're changing it to
the same thing that the mag filter has,
which is three dot linear filter. And
basically, instead of just like taking
the sampled color that they got, they're
just going to linearly interpolate
between the colors. So that's all we're
going to do to hide those seams. So
we'll just do if child do material. We
can check if it has a baked texture by
checking if it has a map. So right, we
attached the image texture to the map
property of the mesh basic material. So
if it exists, it means it has a baked
texture to it. And then we can just set
child.material dominar
filter linear filter just like so. All
right. And this should be sorry, this
should be inside our traverse function.
So let me put this in up over here like
so. And then scene should be outside of
our traverse function. We don't need
that in there. And then okay, I
misspelled this. This should be map.m
minfilter. Now, if I go back, take a
look. We don't see the seams when we go
far away anymore. I also want to change
the field of view. 75 seems a little bit
too high for this. So, I'm going to go
to camera, wherever we created this, and
I'm probably going to put it at like 45
or something like that.
Yeah. Cool. So, this feels a little bit
better. I think in Blender it was 35,
but yeah. So, just adjust it how you
want, but I think 45. Or maybe we can
try 35.
So yeah, so 35 45 doesn't really matter.
Seems okay to me. And everything seems
to be working, which is great. Okay. So
now what I want to do is if the child
material includes glass. So this one
includes a map. So now we just want to
check if child.name that includes glass.
So this time I'll just do glass. And I
capitalized the G. We could just do two
lowercase if we wanted to. Oh well, it
doesn't really matter. And if it does,
then we want to set child domaterial. We
do. We want to set that child domaterial
equal to a new glass material. So you
can separate it if you want. And this
time I'm just going to hardcode it. So
physical material like so. And we'll set
some properties like transparent. We'll
set it equal to true. And I'm kind of
just basing it off the parameters here.
So it's in 3GS examples. If you look up
material/physical/transmission,
you can see what we have here. I think
I'm just going to copy and paste this
honestly. Just uh right in here because
it looks good to me. Like so. I don't
think we need a lot of this. So,
probably don't need color. Don't need
this specular color. Probably don't need
to touch that. And then I'm going to use
this HDR as the reflections. So, I'm
just going to go for I don't know like
1K honestly and just download this here.
So, I'll just do HDRI to cube map and
convert it through here. And I'm just
going to add the HDR here. And then I'll
just convert it to cute map like so. And
save it. We want them split up. So let's
select this one right here. 256
resolution. Yeah, I think 512 will be
okay. Then we can just hit process just
like so. And we can just save that. And
then here we'll get a Q map. Let's
convert all of these to WEBP using
Squish. So let's go back to Squish and
just compress all of these to WEBP.
Cool. So, they're all compressed and you
can see I reduced the file size a lot.
So, let's come over here and we can call
it skybox. I think we can just call it
environment map. Well, I'll call it
skybox because that's kind of what it is
as well. This will just be useful once
we have reflections. So, I'm just going
to click and drag those in there. So,
you can see they're a little bit blurry,
but that's totally okay. Now, in order
to load a cube texture, we need to use
the pre cube texture loader. Let's place
it with the rest of our loaders. So,
probably up here. And let's just do
const environment map like so equals and
whoops I misspelled this environment
map. And this is under slash textures/
skybox skybox. And then we can just do
ctrl d to select the next instance. And
let's just change this to webp because
all of ours are webp. Now in our glass
material we can set the environment map.
So we can just do in environment map
equals environment map just like so. Now
if I go back we should see some sort of
reflection.
Yeah. So, we do see some sort of
reflection along the glass, which makes
it a little bit more realistic. Just
like that. Cool. The next thing I want
to do is do the fishbowl water, which
has a little bit of an alpha.
So, we can do the same thing here. If
childname includes water, water water,
then we want to create a new mesh basic
material. Yeah, I'm just going to set it
equal to the child material. I don't
feel the need to separate them anymore.
I was planning to do that originally,
but not for this. Let's go back. So,
let's go back in Blender and just copy
this hexodimal. The last two are the
alpha channel. So, we don't need that.
We just need the color. So, what we can
do is change this to color. Let's do
Ctrl + E to delete. All right. By the
way, I'm saying control E, but that's
like a custom shortcut that I created
myself. So, if you do delete all right,
you can see that I set it to control E.
So, we can just do 0x and paste our
hexodimal there. And we can set
transparency equal to true. And then we
can put the opacity at like 0.6.
I think it was 0.66 in Blender. It
doesn't really matter, but we can just
check. So now if I go back here, you can
see that we do have the water material,
and it looks nice, but we can't see it
behind here. And that's kind of the
issue with transparency. But that's fine
because we can fix that simply by
setting this equal to false depth,
right? So this way, you know, the
renderer doesn't determine which one is
blocking the other one. You know, they
just blend together. So, what we can do
then is just set depth right depth right
equal to false. Whoops, sorry, not a
semicolon. And then we can just copy and
paste this in here somewhere just like
so. And whoops, I forgot the comma. And
I just realized that this is also inside
of our object keys, which doesn't make
sense because these are separate. So,
what we can do is just move them out.
So, I'm going to let's see glass. Let's
just get this parenthesy out here. We
want it outside but still inside if
child.m mesh. We just want it outside of
our texture mapping loop. And then we
can change this to else. If just to make
it a little bit more explicit. Save it
like so. And then here we can just do an
else like so. And then let's just move
our object keys function inside of that
bracket up there. Just using alt up
arrow to move it up a line. So now if I
go back you can see that we can see the
water and the glass. Okay. Let's check
for any errors in the console that we
might not light intensity is an
exposure. It's not a property. Okay,
let's just get rid of light intensity
and exposure then. Cool. Those are gone.
This is from one of my plugins. So, you
can just ignore that. I also just
realized we have two objects that are
using the glass material. So, we're
creating a new material for each object,
which is bad. We just want to use the
same exact material. You know, it's like
creating two materials in Blender, but
not changing a single parameter in each
one of them. So, it just takes up
unnecessary space. So let's come over
here. Let's just do con glass material
like so. And let's just set it equal to
the material that we created. And then
we can set the glass material equal to
this sorry the child material equal to
the glass material. And then we can just
copy this else if and just paste it over
here. And then we want to check for
bubble. And then I'll call this white
material. And I will just create a new
mesh basic material like so. So, I'm
just going to call this const white
white material equals Whoops. Let's get
rid of this. And I'll just do # FF FF
FFF. Don't need transparency. Don't need
this. Don't need this. Just like so. And
now you can see I have my little bubbles
there. Okay. Now, we just need to set
our screen. So, I'm just going to do
else if. And I'm just going to change
this to screen.
So, in order for this to work, let's
change this to a new mesh basic
material. So, this time we only have one
screen, so we don't have to split it
out. We can just do equals new basic
material. And then for the map, we can
just put it to a video texture that we
will create in just a few seconds. So,
let's see. Okay, we just need to get rid
of that equals. Let's just create this
video texture with our other material
kind of areas. So, we need to create a
video element first. If you want to put
it in your HTML directly, you can
totally do that. I'm just going to do it
in JavaScript. So, everything's in a
single place. So, I'm just going to do
document.createelement.
Create uh and it'll be a video HTML
element. And we'll set it source video.
Let's see. Equal to let's see where do
we put it? Okay. Slash textures
/extures/room
uh slash video. So, it should be in
here. So, I have a small video here that
I'm going to be using. So, you know, use
whatever video you want. Just make sure
the file size is kind of small. Cool.
So, this is called screen.mpp4. So, I'll
just call it screen.mpp4. Just like so.
I want it to loop. So, I'm just going to
shift alt down arrow. I want it to loop.
So, I'm going to set this to we're going
to set this to true. Just like so. We
have to mute it if we want to autoplay
it. And I don't have any audio anyway.
So, I'm just going to set it to true.
Then we can set then autoplay to true.
It will if you don't set sorry this
should be muted. If you don't set muted
equal to true autoplay won't work. That
way they just prevent you from like if
someone loads on a site it'll just like
bombard you with extremely loud noise
and things like that. So the same thing
is true for with audio. And then we can
just tell it to play. So we can do video
element.play
like so. And typically if you just want
it constrained to its own space rather
than full screen, you just do plays in
line and also set that to true. For us,
I don't think that will actually really
matter. And then to use video texture in
3GS, you can just see that it's built in
into the 3xport by itself. So we can
just get the video element and create it
there. But again, we don't have the HTML
element. We're creating it with
JavaScript. So we can just use that
instead. So, let's just do const video
texture equal equals new 3 dot video
texture. And we just grab the video
element right here because it's just an
HTML element stored in this variable
right here. And let's just make sure the
color space is the same. I don't
actually know if we need this or not,
but it's better safe than sorry. So, I'm
just going to 3 sRGB color space just
like so. And then we can just place the
video texture. Well, actually, we
already did that. All right, this should
be good. Let's go take a look and see.
Okay, let's see. Failed to load. No
supported source was found. Okay, it's
probably a glitch somewhere. Let's see.
I mean, the path is probably wrong. /ext
rooms slash room slash Oh, video
separate. So, whoops, my bad. Cool. Take
a look. Now, our video is on top of our
computer screen. Super super cool. Just
like that. So, of course, we also need
to do video texture flip y and set that
to false as well. And sweet. Now, it's
upright just like that. Oh, by the way,
if this if you feel like the screen is a
little too stand outish given that it's
under the shadow and whatnot, you can
totally like probably reduce the opacity
with the mesh basic material or if you
want reflections as well, you can
totally change this to a mesh physical
material just like our glass material
and then play around with some of those
settings as well. So, you could totally
do that if you wanted to. Additionally,
if you want, you can put a plane around
here. You can either create that plane
in 3GS or you can create it in Blender
and reexport your model. You know,
really up to you. I might do that a
little bit later, but for now, I'm just
going to move on. Okay, the next thing I
want to do is set like a default camera
position because right now, every time I
refresh, I start here and then I have to
like zoom out and then pan just to get
like a decent view. Come into my render
function over here and I'm going to do
thing. I'm going to log the camera
position. So, I'll do camera
sorry.position and let me put that in a
console.log. log sorry console log
camera position and I also want to log
the orbit controls target which by
default this vector 3 of orbit controls
it starts at it looks at 0000 so we also
want to change the target as well so we
can do controls controls we called it
controls and we'll just log out the
target there and we'll just do
console.log vlog. I just want to split
it up. So, I'm just going to put like
something there. Okay. Now, we just find
a good camera position that we like.
This seems pretty good. So, I'm just
going to scroll up once on my mouse
wheel, just like so. And I'm just going
to copy all this. So, let's open this.
And let's open this. All right. So,
let's just make sure to copy these
values. So, I'm just going to copy this
over here. And I'm going to go into
perspective camera. And I'm going to do
set and just paste this in here.
Now, I don't want to save my file yet
because it'll hot module reload and I'll
lose these values. So, I'm just going to
copy these now. And for controls over
here, I'll do controls.target
set. And I'll just paste this in here.
Okay. Now, we can get rid of all this
other stuff. And then we can just place
some commas here. Let's get rid of all
this stuff as well. Cool. Let's get rid
of that. Alt for two cursors. Save like
so. Let's get rid of these. Cool. Now
both position and controls.target
they're both vector 3es. You can see
right here target is a vector 3. If you
go to vector 3 all vector 3s have set
which just sets the xyz components of
this vector. So that's kind of all we're
doing instead of using dot notation like
I had earlier. Now you can see every
time I refresh my page I'll just start
with this camera angle which is really
nice. And we can just uh comment this
out for now. We might revisit that in a
little bit. Okay. Okay, so the next
thing I want to do is make the things
that I uh want to interact to actually
be interactable in the 3GS scene like
these buttons over here and this and
this and this. And the way to do that is
using the 3GS ray caster, which which I
covered in my previous video, but
basically it shoots a ray from your
cursor. Well, for us it will be our
cursor through our simulated camera, you
know, directly forward ahead and if
anything is intersecting with that ray,
it'll it'll find out and and then you
can sort of listen to that intersection
event and then, you know, handle events.
So, it takes intersect objects which is
just an array of objects. And since our
GB file has a bunch of objects in there,
the only way we would be able to prepare
our raycaster for that is if we manually
typed each name because unfortunately
even though we put all our interactable
targets into our targets collection,
that doesn't really translate to 3GS. So
what I should have done before
exporting, which is fine, is just
honestly add a underscore target here.
So then we can just check that
everything that is indeed a target will
be hit into our raycast cer. So only
give the underscore target ID, whatever
you want to call it. If you want to call
it like raycaster and just check if the
name includes raycaster, you can totally
do that as well. And actually, I feel
like that might be a little more clear
because we have these other targets that
are also targets, but they're not being
raycasted. So maybe what I'm going to do
is select all these. We're going to do
that battery name again. Just out of the
selected ones under target, I'm just
going to replace it with raycaster.
Whoops. I guess I didn't need to do the
underscore, but anyway. Yeah. And now
what I'm going to do is just copy ray
caster for everything that I want
raycaster. So yeah, see these I don't
want ray casters. So I'm not going to
give those to neither the fish bubbles.
But these ones I definitely want to give
the raycaster. So anything that you want
to be clickable or like hoverable or
listen to some sort of event, you know,
definitely give it a raycaster for sure.
Now, I left this in here originally, but
now looking back in the browser, I will
never see that back face ever because
I'm capping the rotation to like this
and this. So, there's no point of
keeping that there. It's just taking up
file size inner geometry. Yes, ideally
you would re-ake because it took up
because it took up a huge portion of the
texture which you could fit other
objects in there. So, yes, it's a
complete waste, but but oh well, at
least uh we can save on some file space.
But if you want to re-ake, you totally
can. But that takes a lot of time. So I
just I'm just going to not do that.
Let's just make sure we we can delete
these as well. So I just want to make
sure that I'm getting only that. Let's
just delete those vertices. Cool. Yeah.
So we'll never see those back ones.
Okay. Cool. We could cut this as well
and then just save up on that amount as
well, but you know, it's not really too
much of a big deal. You know, we don't
have to be too perfect about it. Oh,
here I guess for this back we can do
that. So, we can add like a loop cut.
Uh, let's just leave it halfway just to
be safe. And then let's just delete
these vertices here. Again, we're
wasting texture space cuz we have bake
the full length rather than just a
little bit. But that's totally okay. So,
again, I'm capping it to here so they'll
never notice. Another thing I'll say is
if you accidentally messed up a baking
and you don't want to bake again, you
still have sort of, you know, ways to
get around that. But for example, this
lamp here, I kind of want it to be its
own target that I animate in and bounce
in. So what I can do is select
everything plus just to increase my
selection more. Get everything there.
Again, if you don't have that, you can
do select more less right here. And then
I can do P separate by selection. And I
can rename this to lamp and underscore
first and then move this into targets.
Now obviously if I go from a scale of
zero. Well actually let's reset its
origin point for first. So I'm going to
right click set origin origin to
geometry and then control period gz and
just snap it down to the bottom here.
Crl+ just to confirm that. Okay. So if I
scale it like this if the scale is zero,
let me just hide it with h real quick.
You can see that this place is black and
that would look kind of awkward from far
away. Actually, for luckily for this,
you know, no one can really tell, but we
can possibly get away with is texture
painting a color over here. So, you can
do this in Photoshop. Normally, what I
would do is in Photoshop, I would like
circle this area, select this area, and
do content aware fill. And then it'll
kind of fill in that area really, really
nicely. But, you know, Photoshop is
paid, so I'm not going to be doing that.
So, you kind of have like two options
here. You can hit period key just to
jump to your UV where it is. And you can
see over there what it's highlighting is
that sort of thing there. But since this
is roughly the same shadow area, we can
actually just move this and map it over
somewhere here. And now you can see well
now the color is a little bit off
because that area is darker than over
here. So but from far away you can see
that actually no one can tell
whatsoever.
So if you want to do that, you can do
that or you can try and get away with
just scaling it down. It might look a
little more blurry, but it might be
better, more seamless this way. Now, you
can see it definitely looks a little bit
more seamless. So, you might want to
grab some of these edges just to move
them a little bit, you know, make them a
little bit darker as well, just move it
back over here. Yeah. So, from far away
now, you know, no one can tell that
there's anything messed up there. So, if
you don't want to use that sort of hacky
method, what you can do instead is
actually paint right over these. So
again, you can also do this in
Photoshop, but let's see. Okay, it's
right here on the image texture. If we
go to texture paint and we navigate to
Okay, we're already on here. Let's just
see where it is. So this giant bulb
right here. So what we can do is
probably sample some sort of thing here
and just like repaint it. So if you have
Photoshop, you'd do the same thing in
Photoshop as well. So we can like sample
a color from there and like just paint
over there like so. And of course, you
have options to adjust your brush, which
I'm not going to be covering in this
video, but that's something you can do
as well. And you can see I'm just going
over there. You can adjust your strength
if necessary. And of course, you can
always resample your colors to like get
a darker place. And then hit F to make
your cursor a little bit smaller. Shift
F to control the strength. And then you
can just like paint, you know, the the
details back in there. And you can see
I'm just like painting the lines back
there. So, if you want to sample a color
really quickly, you can just hold shift
X and you can see my color is updating
up there. And I don't have to hit
anything after shift X. I just do shift
X and it'll sample the color. So, here
maybe I want a little more of this color
over here. So, I'm just texture painting
back. And then what you can do then is
you can see that asterisk means it's not
saved. Is do Alt S and save it. And then
let's go back into your shader editor or
anywhere that you have a shader editor.
So somewhere over here like so. I have
first texture set just hit alt R just to
reload images. And now if I go into
solid. Let's go back to rendered. You
can see we kind of patched up that hole.
Yeah, it definitely looks a little bit
messy. But you know if you had good
texture painting, you could polish that
up and make it look nice. Typically
though, again what I do is like I go in
Photoshop, I just select that area. I do
content aware fill or generative AI. Now
you can just do like remove background
and it'll like do the effectively the
same thing. I'll also say yeah don't
accidentally delete things that Whoops.
I accidentally deleted something. And I
don't have undo available because it's
so far deep which is a little bit tragic
but that's fine. And this is why we do
file save incremental because I can just
go to let's say this one. Might as well
just save this file. And here luckily we
still have this here. So let's see
cube.00001.
Cool. We can just shift duplicate this.
Move it to a new collection just called
messed up.
That's totally okay. We don't care about
the name here. Let's just do go back to
baking tutorial. Save for sure. Okay.
Now, with this all this messed up, what
we can do is just select these. We could
join them if we wanted to. I feel like
I'm just going to select all these and
just delete these vertices like so.
Let's come here to file, append. Let's
search for that one that we had
collection. Let's see. Where's our
messed up one? Okay, we just added it.
Cool. Now it's here.
So, we could we can just get rid of the
UV map. And it should be fine if we just
have simple bake here. And then this was
with texture set one. So, we can change
the material for first texture set.
Cool. Works. And now we can just delete
this bottom face over here. Let's go
into local view just to make sure that
yeah, back face is deleted as well.
Okay, now we can just join this back
with the first texture set because I'm
not going to be animating it. Cool. So,
there is the power of saving versions.
You know, that would have been
catastrophic to fix otherwise. Well,
maybe not that bad. We would just fill
in the top and then find it on here and
just map it again, but whatever. So,
when you're done with everything that
needs to be done, you can just hit A to
select everything. File, export, glTF.
We shouldn't have to touch any of this
because we kept it. Remember export
settings. Yep. No export in the
material. I'm going to version this into
V1. That way we have a fallback in case
we messed up something.
Again, don't forget if you have made any
edits in Blender to your texture, make
sure to compress it again. And then for
your GB file, make sure to put it into
gltf report and again change this to
Draco and just export and download it
somewhere. So that's all I did. And then
I just changed the original one to
underscore V1. I just replaced the
textures over here. And then the new one
that I just created, I called it
underscore v2. And then I just changed
the path to underscore vv2. If you want
to just replace the old one and keep it
as room_folio or just delete that one,
that's totally fine as well. Okay, the
next thing I want to do is go to GitHub
and create a new repository. Typically
in my previous videos, I would just push
at the end, but that's typically not my
workflow at all. I set up get, you know,
right from the get- go, so we might as
well just do it now. So, I'm just going
to name it Sue a Kimfolio,
but you know, name it whatever you want
it. Uh, just leave it public. And I'll
create the repository for now. Then I'm
going to assume you have git installed.
So, I'm just going to do this real
quick. Get init
origin right here. Then, let's uh let's
change it to main. I think by default I
already have it to main, but I might as
well just in case. If you want to leave
it at master, that's totally fine as
well. Let's just get add everything.
Cool. And then let's do get commit just
like so.
And let's just get push- origin
in Verscell. And if you connect to your
GitHub account, it should automatically
find your latest repository push. So you
can just hit import just like so. And it
should automatically detect your Vit
with no issues. Here you can see that it
finds our upper directory you know v
build everything seems to be fine here
we don't have to edit anything and we
can just deploy it and now every time
you push by default it will
automatically make another push so if
you wait about 2 or 3 minutes you should
be able to see it when you visit this
URL every time you make a new push and
yeah you can just already share this
with the world which is just your
initial one but every time you push it
should be updating super super cool okay
why don't we do something simple first
and let's make the fans hands rotate.
So, I'll say that these two are number
two and four, which means it has to
rotate, I think, along the Z-axis. I'm
not sure. And then these will have to do
along the Y-axis given my intuition. So,
we can have const Zaxis fans like so.
And we'll just have an array of fans
that we want to target. And then and
then here we can have like ISIS fans.
Now, let's just go to our loader.load
function. So over here our fans are
baked. So we want to come into this else
statement over here. And we can just
check if child.name includes we want to
check for fan because I have that name
in blender just like so. And if
child.name includes let's see we can
just do fan_2 which is kind of overkill
but whatever you know it works. It
works. And then we can just do or fan_4.
Then we'll do Z-axis fans and we'll just
push the child there to that. Otherwise,
what we want to do is push to the Y-axis
like so. And just like the default
rotating cube that they give us in the
getting started, we can animate our
fans. So, animate fans, we can do Z-axis
fans like so. And then for each of these
fans, we can just add to their rotation.
So, whoops, sorry, I should call this
fan. And then fan.rotation.z
Z plus equals. We can just do 01. I
think that was like fast enough with the
default rotating cube and it might look
good for the fans. Shift alt down arrow
change this to Y-axis. And then this one
can be Y instead. And now if I go back
here, you can see I have some rotating
fans. Looks like Z-axis is not the right
call. It should be X-axis. So let's just
control shift L for Z-axis with a
highlighted. It will select all the
instances. And we can just type X-axis
here. And then we can change this to X.
And now you can see we have some
rotating fans just like that. And if
your rotation is really wonky, again,
make sure that your origin point is in
the center of your fans. All right. Now,
we need to create a ray caster and then
normalize our device coordinates such
that the ray caster can calculate
appropriately. I explained this in my
previous video, but basically in the
browser in JavaScript, it starts 0, 0 in
the corner and it goes to like whatever
like 1,000 comma 10,000 in your browser
window or whatever resolution it is. And
basically what this does is it makes
your center 0 0. And if you go to the
left it's negative 1. If you go to the
right it's one. If you go up it's going
to be one. If you go down it's going to
be negative 1. So I'm we can just
reorganize everything later but I'm just
going to do it here. Window add event
listener like so. And this one's going
to be mouse move. They use onpointer
move and this works but it has issues
with iOS devices which means you have to
use like touch move instead. So I'm just
going to split it out into mouse move
and touch events rather than just using
pointer. All right, let's just come over
here. Create an arrow function and we
want that event object that comes in
there. So, so let's come over here as
well. And of course, we need these to
update. So, I'm actually just going to
leave it as pointer because why not the
variable name as least, but we will be
updating it in the mouse move. So, let's
just take a look at can just type
pointer.x equals. And now the event
object should be similar to on pointer
move as for mouse move. So we should
just be able to copy and paste this and
have it work. Let's control D and change
this to E because we call it E. If you
want to call it event, you can totally
do that as well. All right, let's come
into our render function now. So let's
go back up. Shift shift enter to go back
up one instead of down one. So you can
see that if I go shift enter, it'll go
up to 11. So I just went up from one
down to 13 to quickly jump to it. And
now we can just copy this stuff. So
raycast caster set from camera check if
the intersect objects and then do
something with it for each of the
intersected objects. So we can just copy
that anywhere here. Let's just do ray
cer ray cer. And of course we want to
pass in our intersect objects. And I
believe we called it ray cer objects.
Maybe we could have called it intersect
objects. Oh well. Now also when I am
hovering or I have an intersection I
want to show that the pointer is
clickable. So I'm going to change the
cursor if intersects. If there's some
sort of intersection it doesn't matter
what it is. So if it's greater than zero
it means we're intersecting with
something. We're going to set the
document.body.style.cursor
and we're going to set that to pointer.
Otherwise we're just going to set it to
default. So we can just leave it at
default like so. And this should be
working like so. So, if I go back and
hover over here, you can see I my mouse
moves to pointer. And when I get off,
it's not. And everything's turning red.
Super super cool. There's some things
that I don't want clickable, but are
still showing the pointer icon. So,
these are going to be an issue here. And
then these are not showing up either as
red, even though they should be. So, if
I go back into Blender, it becomes clear
why these are not highlighting because I
didn't give the raycaster ID to it. So,
I would just give raycaster ID to them
right now. So I'm going to put it into
raycaster under raycaster. And I
accidentally gave it to fishbowl glass
which I'm going to get rid of. And then
I also gave it to computer glass by
accident. And now let's just give it to
GitHub. We'll just attach ray caster
over there. Now another thing we should
add for the UI is everything that we
want to show the pointer when we hover
over it. We can do that. So this one we
can do uh underscore hover or underscore
pointer, you know, whatever you want to
call it. And if you have if you want
like different effects for each one,
then you can actually tag on multiple
IDs and then depending on that you can
adjust it accordingly. Exporting and
compressing only takes like 5 minutes
each time. So, you know, it's not a big
deal if you have to come back here
later. So, my work button I wanted to
show pointer. Cool. So, I would I'll
just So, let me just copy that. And then
for about I'm just going to hit period
to jump to there. I'm going to attach
the pointer ID to that one. Same with
contact and whoops. I guess I should
have done it for these at the same time
that I added ray caster. So these are
ones that I definitely want to show that
you can click on them again. Do it for
whatever you want on your scene that can
be clickable. And if you don't know, you
know, you can always come back here
later and do it another time. Okay. So
let's just hit A to export again. File,
export glTF. Let's do room portfolio.
room portfolio
version 3 v3. Again, you know the drill.
I'm just going to export it. So, same
deal. I put it into gltf report,
downloaded it, put it into models, and
just change my path right here. Okay,
let's come back up here and let's create
a let current intersect. So, all the
current intersected objects. We'll just
do current intersects
like so. Like here. And let's just come
back down over here. And instead of
setting const intersects here, we can
set our current intersects over here.
And then we can control D changes to
current intersects. If current
intersects, there is a current
intersect. That means it will return
some sort of thing. So greater than
zero, we can we can just set like some
const value here called current
intersect object. And we'll just set it
to the first intersection. So whatever
is in front, we're just grabbing the
first intersecting of the array. So
basically just what's in front and it
should just be dot object. And then we
can just check if current intersect
object name.inccludes
our pointer ID that we gave it to. Then
we can show the pointer otherwise we
just won't. So let's just make sure I
have this inside of this. Cool. Let's
see. Do I have one here? Cool. Now in
the event that there's no intersect
object, we still want to be able to
reset the cursor. So, we want to also
put the else on the outside of the if
statement for this one as well. So,
we'll just set that back to default as
well. Now, if I go back, I should hover
over the ones with pointer ID. They
should show the pointer. And then the
ones that don't, like this boa t here
and these light bulbs that I made them
like so. But all of these show the
pointer, which is awesome. These are the
ones that I gave the pointer ID. And
then these ones don't. By the way, if
you have no idea what I'm logging here,
you know, it's just a bunch of objects
and I'm just accessing a bunch of object
data. So that's all that is. At any
point of the time, you can just log it
out and you'll see all the object and
what I'm selecting. Okay, let's get rid
of this color thing. We'll revisit this
in a little bit. Now, let's create our
social links so we can just get those
working right now. So, I'm just going to
put it up here. Let's just do con social
links. And I'll make this an object. So,
we have GitHub. And I'll just set that
to So, I'm just going to set that to
github.com like so. And I'm going to set
YouTube just equal to youtube.com. So
I'm just going to paste that there.
Shift alt down arrow. And let's control
D and change this to Twitter. Now let's
take a look at our under. So what we
need is an on click event listener. So
we can just do window.addeventlister
and we'll do click. So once we click on
something, we can check if our current
intersects object sorry array has a
length of zero. That means we're
intersecting something. Honestly, we
could use a current intersect object
global variable if we wanted to, but you
know, we can just do this anyway. And
then we'll just do con object equal
current intersect. Again, we'll just get
the first one like so. And then for each
of the social links, again, we're going
to use object. entries. So, the key and
the value. So, object entries. Go for
the social links, we'll do for each of
the social links, we'll get the key,
which is GitHub, Twitter, YouTube, that
sort of stuff. And then I'll just call
it URL. They call it value in the docs,
but we'll just call it URL. And whoops,
I want need to do it like so. Create a
function here. And whoops, I'm missing a
another parenthesy over here and one
over here. So if objectname
doccludes includes the key that we're
looking for, right? Which is just
GitHub, YouTube, that sort of stuff.
Then let's just do const new window
equals window.open
open. So, we're opening a new window
here, and we want to set some things for
this new window open. For example, the
opener, we're going to set it equal to
null. These are just security things
that are best practices. Very, very
common. If you've ever worked with links
before, you've definitely seen this
done. So, we're just doing it in
JavaScript instead. Window.loation.
We're just going to set it to the URL
associated with that key. And then just
more stuff. Window.target equals blank.
Whoops. Target. And then, just more
security stuff here. No opener. No
referer.
Whoops. That should just be E2. Like so.
So now when I click on these, it should
work. Well, okay. YouTube works, Twitter
works, GitHub does not work. GitHub does
not work, which means I probably
misspelled. I probably had a capital H
in Blender. I don't actually know, but
this probably because of that. Yeah.
Okay. It's because of that. Sweet. All
right. Now, we just need to display our
modals when we select our navigation
buttons. So, let's go into index.html
and set those up. So, I'm just going to
place it here. I want three modals. So,
I'm just going to do times three. And
then we can have like an about and then
we can have like a contact. And then I
think my last one was work. Let's just
put in the same order. It honestly
doesn't really matter, but I'm just
going to keep it the same order. Now,
what we can do in style.css is just
target these modals. So, I'm just going
to do the generic stuff for the modals.
So, I'm just going to make all of them
the same style for now. So, I'll just do
modal. And I'm just going to do the
generic position. Uh, whoops. Absolute
like so. Just to center it real quickly.
Top 50%.
Left 50%. Just like so. And then
transform. Transform. Translate
50%. Com, 50%, just like so. And let's
just make the font size really big. So,
like 32 pixels, like so. Let's go back
to index.html. Control P index.html.
Let's put some stuff in here. So, I'll
do work and we'll just copy and paste
that a bunch. And then I'll do about
here. And then for contact, we can write
contact and a bunch of other random
characters after that. And then let's
just set their zindex to like 999 so
they're in front of everything just like
so. Cool. And you can see that they're
all there right now. Now, I want to hide
them and then display them. So, what we
can do is just like let's just set
display equal none for now. And later
we'll fix that. Also, inside of index
html, what I want first is an exit
button. I'm going to create another HTML
element here. And I'll just call it
modal exit button. Exit button like so.
And I'll just type exit modal here.
Something really large and noticeable.
And then I guess I should have just done
it appropriately, but whatever. We can
just do it now. And then I'll just do
like H1 modal title. And then let's just
move our random spam inside of model
title. I don't actually know what format
I'm going for yet. So, I'm just doing
some dummy content for now. So, cool. We
have a bunch of modals with a title and
an exit modal. And these should be a
button. Sorry. Hold alt, double click,
and let's just place button there. All
right. Let's go back to main.js. And
let's do control W just to quickly close
that. And in main.js, we want to select
all our modals. So, we can create an
object for that. That way, we can just
loop through them later. So const modals
equals just like so we have work and we
have let's see about and contact as
well. So we can just do something like
so and let's just place three cursors
here and documentquery selector like so
and all of them have the modal class. So
we can do dot modal and then just the
appropriate thing. So this way oops zero
out there sorry backspace I mean and
then we just selecting both their class
names. So it says so I'm going to be
using gap the animation library to
animate these modals coming in. So we
need to import that. So what I'm going
to do is come up here just import gap
from gap and gap and then we can create
our functions that animate our modal. So
we'll do the first one con show model.
And we'll pass in a model here like so.
And let's see what the issue. Oh, it
didn't recognize a spacer. Okay, that's
fine. And then we can just immediately
set the model.style display equal from
hidden to block. So as as soon as we
click on one of our bottom options, it
will click show model. It'll pass in the
modal and we'll just set it to block.
And then when it comes to Gab
animations, you have to set your initial
states with Gab itself, otherwise it
might glitch out. Not always, but
sometimes you do. So in this case, I
want to set I just I'm just going to go
for a basic opacity animation for now.
So I just do set modal and I'm just
going to target the opacity of the CSS
property. And I'm just going to set that
as default as zero. And then I'm just
going to do gab.2. Take the model again.
And this time I'm just going to set its
opacity equal to one. And whoops, sorry,
this should be a semicolon like so. And
we can just make the duration really
quick. I think by default it is 1
second. So now I'm just setting it to
0.5 seconds. And then we can have one
for hide model as well. So let's just
come over here and let's just change
this to hide modal. So we're going to
come over here and we'll just set this
opacity to zero now. And sorry opacity
is misspelled here. It should be opacity
like this. Cool. And then on complete,
we want to display none. So it'll be
opacity zero, but we still can click on
it. So afterwards, we want to once the
animation is done playing, we want to
set it back to none. Display none. So
we'll just copy this right here. And
let's add a carrot over here. And then
just set this back to none. Just like
so. Okay. Now we should just be able to
go to our click. So in here, our buttons
already have underscore raycaster
associated with it. So it should already
be a part of our intersect objects that
we are checking for here. So let's just
come here and now we should just be able
to check for those. So let's make sure
I'm out of the entries. That's cool. We
already have this. So I'm just going to
copy this right here actually. And we
want to check for work button. If it is,
then we can show our model and pass in
that model. So we'll just pass in
modals.work.
So remember this is the object that we
created up there and we're just
accessing the work which was selecting
the document query selected the modal.
Then we can do else if and let's just
copy and paste this cuz why not? Whoops.
Let's just copy and paste this cuz why
not? Let's change this to about. Let's
place some parentheses here. And then
let's just copy and paste this one more
time. You could use else if you wanted
to but you know no reason to do that.
And then let's just change this over
here. Let's change this to about. Let's
change this to contact. Like so. All
right. So, if I go back, these should
work. Let's see. Child is not defined.
Okay. That's probably because
yeah, down here I was traversing child
for mesh name, but now we called it
object. So, sorry. This should be
object. So, control D. Select next
instance. Change that to object. Oh,
random. But I did give it a background
color of black. So, if I go back, it
should be working now. Let me click
here. So yeah, it's working. But okay, I
forgot to do the exit button. So invalid
property duration. Uh yeah, I misspelled
that. Okay, so let's just we can just
fix that real quick. Let's just control
D duration like so. And then now we can
select all our buttons. So we can
documentquery selector all and I forgot
what I called it in index.html modal
exit button. So I'll do alt left arrow
just to jump back to where I go. By the
way, if you want to jump to where your
previous cursor location, you can just
use your alt, left, and right arrow
keys. Or you can just come up here and
click here. We're going to select all
our modal exit buttons. Exit buttons.
Sorry, I keep saying buttons and then
adding the S in in there. And then for
each of these buttons, button. And for
each of these buttons, what we're going
to do is add an eventlister. So
button.addeventlister. And it'll just be
a simple click. Let's grab that
eventlister. I mean, sorry, that event
object. And we need to find the modal.
We could pass in the model if we wanted
to, but I'm just going to find it. So,
we can do e target closest and we can
pass in the class nameal. And then we of
course we can just hide modal and then
use the modal that we found to hide and
play the animation over here. So, if you
don't know what closest is, basically
what so basically what it does is your
click events happens at this button.
It's going to search up your hierarchy
for that class. So, basically like
searching for the parent. In this case,
we the parent itself is just dot model.
But if you had a deeper nested thing, it
would go up one level and keep going
until it find it. So if I have my click
event on this button, well, it's going
to find this model because I'm going up
up and then I get this parent here. So
that's just kind of like a neat trick to
speed things up. So now if I go back and
hit my work, hit exit model. You can see
everything is working just like so.
Super super cool. I also think now's a
good time to push because we started
getting something. So we can just do get
add everything get commit dashm and
let's just say uh I don't know starting
modals working basic or we or and we can
do something like we're you know
something random just like so and we can
just do get push just like so. All right
we're getting somewhere. Okay now what I
want to do is fix the touch events
because right now when I click on it I
have to click twice for this to activate
and when I click on this exit button
sometimes it glitches out and it will
like flicker. You can see it'll flicker
there. And this is probably because we
have so many concurrent events. We have
orbit controls which takes a bunch of
touch events. Then we have our ray cer
that's detecting a click event, I
believe. And also the HTML element. So
there's kind of all these conflicting
events. So let's try and manage that and
fix that right now. So what I'm going to
do is add a touch start and touch end.
Unfortunately, like I said earlier,
pointer move, it'll work on Android and
PC, but there's issues with iOS devices
with pointer move. So we are splitting
them up. So I'm going to do touch start
like so. And then once I hit my finger
on the screen, sorry, tap the surface.
That triggers a touch start event. So
that's when I want to update my pointer
for the raycast caster camera. So I
should just copy and paste this over
here. Now instead of this event object,
we need to grab event object.ouches
touches and we want to just grab the
first finger that you get client X. So
basically the event object has this
thing here. If you want, you can just
console.log e, but it has this thing
here called touches. And let's say you
put three fingers on your screen. Zero
just gets the first finger that landed
on your screen. So that's kind of all we
need. So we're going to do the same
thing over here. Y. And this calculation
should work. If I messed up something,
we'll find out later. Now, we also want
to do e.prevent default because we have
like scrolling behaviors on mobile and
things like that. So prevent those
default behaviors. And then we have to
change this into a active event listener
by setting the second parameter over
here. And then we want a touch end event
listener. And this will so when they
release their finger from the screen,
this is going to trigger. So let's
change this to touch end like here. Also
e.prevent default. And let's create a
new function here called handle
raycaster interaction. That way we don't
have to do it for the click as well as
the touch start. By default, click is
supposed to convert to touch events on
mobile. But again, we have so many we
have so many conflicting events that I
feel like it's glitching out. So, let's
just create a function here. And I'll
just call it handle. Whoops. Handle ray
caster interaction like so. And let's
make sure I put parenthesis here. So,
I'm calling it fine. And let's just grab
this if statement here. Ctrl X to cut
it. Ctrl +V to paste it in there. And
then here, we can just pass in the
function instead. So handle recaster
interaction. All right. So this should
be working. And now if I go back here,
let's hope this is working. And yeah,
you can see now when I go here, it's
working when I click. And then let's
just make sure in desktop. Yeah. Okay.
So it's still working in desktop. Great.
And we don't get any errors. Cool. Now
you will notice there is one issue. I
can't click this exit button anymore.
Honestly, that's probably again with a
bunch of overlapping events. I don't
actually know, but I'm just going to
assume that that's the issue because
click should convert to touch. So what
we can do is add a separate touch event
using the same exact thing. So we can
just copy this over here like so. I also
forgot passive equals false here. So
passive equals false. Well, not equals
false, but passive false. And we can
just change this to touch end. We don't
need touch start, right? Because if they
tap down, there's no event, but as soon
as they release their their finger,
there will be an event there anyway. So
touch end will be fine. So because click
might also accidentally trigger on the
mobile device. What we can do is add a
flag variable and that checks if it's a
touch then don't fire the click one. So
we can just do let touch happened or
something like that and we'll set it to
false. And then if this one is triggered
we'll just set this equal to true. So
we'll set this to true. And then if
touch happened over here if touch
happened if touch happened
just guard clause return and don't do
anything. So, if I go back here, let's
just take a look and check. Cool. That
seems to be working. Now, let's go to
desktop. Okay, exit model is no longer
working. And that makes sense because
once we have a touch event, then we go
to desktop. This is still true. And it's
just constantly returning that guard
clause. So, it's not executing anything
here. So, let's actually just move this
up above here. And then once they mouse
move, we can just like set touch
happened back equal to false. That feels
a little bit hacky, but honestly, you
know, I feel like that. Okay, let's go
from desktop to mobile contact. Let's go
back to desktop still. Great. It works.
Yeah, seems like a sort of a hacky
solution, but I feel like so if I figure
out something, you know, make sure to
check the code for updates. But for now,
that seems to be working for us. So,
I'll just leave it as is. All right. So,
let's come into source and let's create
a styles folder. And this will kind of
just like hold everything in here. So,
let's do fonts. SCSS, which I want to do
right now. So, we can have a custom font
for our model design. I'm not going to
go into too much of the modal styles in
this video because I kind of just want
to focus on the Blender and 3JS part
rather than the styling, but you can
style it however you want. Once you have
your fonts that you want, just click and
drag them into transfer. So, here I just
have my font file that I downloaded
online called Multi Forces and the other
one is shifty notes. Both of them are
public licensed and created by Niscala
Huruff. So, so definitely check them
out. Definitely check the artists out
there to support them. And what we want
to do is convert it to WA and WA 2 files
which are the web fonts and fix vertical
base metrics. Sometimes the fonts will
have and basically what it'll try and do
is like match up your font alignment
because sometimes
depending on how you made your font,
your font can appear in line but like
the actual spacing will be a little bit
different. For the most part though, if
you make your font correctly, this won't
really do anything whether you leave it
on or off. So, I'm just going to leave
it on and I'm just going to hit convert
again. W and W 2, just like so. And then
we can just download our font face kit.
So, here you can see that we have our
fonts. And then we also have this
stylesheet thing here, which we can open
in VS Code. Let's just copy that and
paste that into our fonts.css.
And then let's take what else they gave
us over here. And let's just drag that.
Well, actually, let's create a new
folder here first. And let's just call
it fonts. Let's just click and drag that
into fonts. Cool. So, we have our fonts
right there. Now, we need to go back to
fonts.scss and update the path. So, we
can just come over here and navigate
control shift L to select all the
instances and just do /font slash like
so. Then, let's just go to style.scss
and import it so we can use it. So, we
can come over here and we'll just do at@
use and we'll dot /styles/styles/fonts.
SCSS just like so. Let's add our
semicolon there. Another thing I like to
do is have a reset. So, we can do a
reset. SCSS. Now, the idea behind a
reset is that different browsers have
like different paddings and margins and
defaults and things like that. So,
resets.css will just keep everything
consistent. If you look up CSS resets
online, you'll probably find a lot of
different ones, but this one seems to
work really well. So, I'll just use this
one. Credits to my web. And I'm just
going to paste that into reset. SCSS.
Honestly, for what we're doing, it
probably doesn't really matter. Uh, but,
you know, might as well. I just wanted
to let you know that I do typically, you
know, use a reset. SCCSS. And then
another thing I like to do is definitely
have a variables.CSS file. All right,
let's get our first variable. Um, we
could go back to Blender to get the
color or we can use this thing here,
which I use a lot. It's a color picker
add-on. I totally recommend it. And you
can just like grab a color anywhere on
your screen. So, that looks pretty good.
And you can just copy that. And then in
variables, we can create a variable
here. And I'll just call it base purple.
But you know, if you want to give it a
actual proper naming convention, totally
go for it. And we can go back and maybe
get like a like a base pink or
something. And then I'll just shift alt
down arrow, call this base pink. Well,
it's actually really cool because my VS
Code theme is also kind of following the
same theme that we have for portfolio.
What a coincidence. Base black. And we
can just do #00000000.
And then let's just select a color here.
So I don't want it to be completely
black. Maybe just like something
slightly black. And then we can do the
same thing for white. You know, maybe
maybe instead of # fff, we can do
something that's uh whoops, I forgot
semicolon here. A little bit less white.
I don't know. It's it's really up to
you, though. So back in style. SCSS.
Let's also just import variables. SCSS.
And we have to give it a name space. So
I'll just call it as varss but you know
call it whatever you want to call it.
And now what we should be able to do
let's just for the model itself let's
just do a max width of like 700 pixels.
And then we'll we'll just take 100% of
the width just like so. Then for the
background color let's just do varss dot
and then let's get our variable. So I
forgot what I call it already which is
embarrassing. Um so let's see. Yeah we
can just do base white for now. And if
we you know you can always change it.
So, I'm just getting this variable over
here. And let's get rid of display none
for the time being. So, here you can
see, okay, we see it now. And yeah, we
have the hashtag FDF FDF FD, which is
what we're seeing right here. Super
super cool. I actually don't like how
it's white. Maybe we can get like
something that's over here or something
like so. Let's just create that. And
let's just do base light purple. Purple
like so. And then let's just change this
to base light purple. You know, if you
want to set the font family up here or
wherever you want to use it, you can now
access it. So, you just do it whatever
you want to call it. So, maybe call it
this like so. And then you can have a
fallback to like enter or whatever you
want to do. System UI,
you know, same thing. Whatever you want
to do there for the fallbacks. Yeah. So,
you kind of have all the general idea
when it comes to styling. Yeah. So, now
just have some fun styling your model.
or if you don't want to use a model, you
can do something else like a full screen
overlay or some other canvas transition
or whatnot. But you kind of have the
general workflow now that I typically
use. I also like to when I'm working
with SCSS use at include media. And this
is a really easy way to make break
points in SCSS. Of course, you could
also just do it in native SCSS as well,
but include media kind of makes it a lot
simpler. And then every time that you
have like a breakpoint, basically you
make like a object of break points. So
like mobile is like 20 pixels or
whatever and then desktop is like 787
pixels or whatnot. And then you have
these break points and then in here you
just do add include add include and then
your breakpoint. I think it's like less
than or equal to your breakpoint over
here. And then it'll just pretty much
look like this. You don't have to type
all the media screens and everything
every single time. So that's kind of
just a really nice way to make it
responsive. So you'll probably also see
me use mixins which is part of SCSS but
basically they're reusable styles. So
like display flex and justify content
justify content center all this sort of
stuff is very very repetitive and
appears in multiple places. So basically
you just create the style once.
Basically you just create it once and
then you can just use it in multiple
places just like so. That way you don't
have to copy and paste a bunch. Of
course, you could also just add that
class to the HTML element as well. Or,
you know, you could just do it in SCSS
as well. And of course, you know, feel
free around to play with the Gap here.
If you need a timeline, you can totally
do that as well. So now what I want to
do is when I hover over these, I want
some sort of user feedback in terms of
like scaling or whatnot. So yes, you
could again check for name, but I'm
going to come back here again. Uh,
sorry. And I'm going to have one more.
So I'm going to call hover. So every
item that has a hover, I'm going to add
a hover effect for it. And then for the
ones that I want different hover
effects, I can do like for example over
here, I can do like hover_2
or hover v2, you know, whatever you want
to do it. Just give it some sort of ID
that you can easily check for later.
That's what I'm going to do for all of
these. I'm definitely going to give it
underscore hover. That way when I hover
it, I can apply like a small like a
scale effect. And see, we'll just add
hover effects to all of these.
Yep. So, just give hover to whatever
that you want. And make sure everything
that you have a hover effect, you also
have the raycast cer ID for as well. And
of course, order doesn't really matter
because we're just checking if the name
includes that. So, you know the drill. I
put it in gltf report, downloaded it,
changed it to_v4, and then just change
the path here. All right. So, now we
need to track the hovered objects. So,
let's just come up somewhere. Honestly,
I don't know where. or we can just put
it over here. And let's just do let
current hovered object. So, this will
keep track of whatever we're hovering.
And we're just going to set it to null.
Then, of course, we need to go to our
room portfolio in here and check if the
child name includes hover.
So, yeah, we'll just come over here and
do hover. If you have another one like
hover_2, you can also do that here as
well. I'm just going to do one initially
here. And then in here, what we need to
do is because when I hover over
something, we're going to change it from
an initial scale and rotation or
whatever parameter you want if you want
to change position too as well. You'll
need like an initial position. So in
order to store that, we could attach it
to a custom object or we can just use
this thing here called dot user data as
part of all object 3Ds which includes
our mesh where it stores some user data
that you can put in yourself. So we can
just use this instead. So, since I'm
going to be adjusting the scale,
rotation, and maybe position, we might
as well just do all of them, we'll do
child user data initial scale. Just
create a new three vector 3 to store
that in. So, 3 dove vector 3 like so.
And then again, another built-in method
here. By the way, I'm just telling you
this stuff, but like there it's listed
in the documentation if you don't know
what they do. So, here you can say just
copies the past values into that that
vector that you're calling on on. So,
we'll just copy the child.scale scale
and then for rotation we can do initial
rotation like so and we'll do
child.rotation. Now this can't be this
should be a uler angle rather than a
vector 3 and then we can also do
position here. So we can change this to
initial position and we can change this
to child.position and then we need an is
animating flag because when we're
hovering over it it's going to keep
triggering the play animation. So we
need some sort of flag to say okay only
play it once. So that's what we're going
to be doing now. So just child do user
data is animating animating and I'm just
going to set that to false because it's
not animating by default. Okay, in our
render function. So here we already
check for the current intersected object
or the currently hovered object right
right over here. So we can just check if
the current intersect object current
intersect object its name includes hover
like so. If it does then we can play the
hover animation. So let's just do play
hover animation. And I think if you have
different kinds of hover then you might
want to have an additional parameter
here. But what I want to is definitely
the current hovered object which I we
created up there. And then the second
parameter will be if we are still
hovering that or not. So let's just set
that to true because we are by default
hovering. If this is true if it's
intersecting something and it has the
name of hovering means we're hovering
it. So, we set it to true. And let's
just come up here and create that
function now. So, I completely forgot
what I just called it. Play hover
animation. Okay, cool. So, play hover
animation function. Whoops. We want to
take in that object that we are passing
in that we're hovering and is hovering.
So, if we're hovering it or not. Now, we
don't want to play this if the object is
animating. So, we can just have a guard
clause already. Object dot user data.
So, we created this earlier. We haven't
set this yet, but it's just in advance
is animating. So if you know the object
is animating, we don't want to animate
it again. So we'll just return it and
like so. So nothing will execute. So if
this is false, well then once we're
hovering, then that means we want it to
set to true. So object user data user
data is hovering is animating and we
want to set that to true because now
it's animating. So if we're hovering,
let's play our hovering animation. So we
can just do something arbitrary. I don't
know if we need a timeline yet. So I'm
just going to do gap.2
and then object.cale. So we just get the
object scale. We can set it x to object
do user data user data that initial
scale that we had originally dox. And
then we can just multiply it by like
some sort of random factor here. And I'm
missing a comma here. And then we can
just shift alt down arrow twice. And
then do the same thing for y and z. But,
you know, if you want to give them
different scalings or if you only want
to do X and Y, I honestly don't know yet
cuz I haven't done it yet. So, I'm just
going to do all of them and see what
that gives me. We can set like a
duration of like 0.5 seconds. And then I
definitely want to ease in for like some
stylistic effect. So, I think what I
want to do is bounce in possibly. I
don't know. And then we can set how how
strong that is. And I'm just taking a
wild guess here. But if you want to like
actually look at it, you can actually
see the ease visualizer on GSAP over
here. And you can see, you know, how the
ease would appear on like your scale and
things like that. And then you can also
make like your own custom ease. So right
now I'm doing bounce out. So it's kind
of like so. And then you can like adjust
this over here. And then you can just
copy it and then use it yourself. So
that's really really cool. And actually
looking at this, I think I want to do
bounce out, not bounce in. So let's just
do bounce out.
And then we can do the same thing except
for rotation. So let's just do
object.rotation.
And then let's just change this to uh
initial rotation like so. And I forgot
what axis it is. I only want to do it on
I think it was x-axis because for our
fans that were oriented the same way it
was on the x-axis. So I'm going to take
a guess x and I'm going to add like I
don't know math.pi pi pi and then maybe
like divided by 8 or something like
that. This might be a little bit too
much rotation, but we'll see. And by the
way, if you don't want to use like unit
circle values, that's totally okay. You
can just like multiply it by like 01 and
then just go trial and error from there.
So since both of these have the same
duration, we can just put the onmplete
in either one of them. So once this is
done completing, that means is animating
is back to false. So let's just put in
that call back on complete like so. What
we what do we want to do? We just want
to Whoops. This should be equals. We
just want to set object do user data is
animating. And we just want to set that
back to false because it's no longer
animating. Also, sorry, I just realized
this should be is hovering, not just
hovering. Sorry. Okay. So, if we're no
longer hovering that thing, then what we
can do is play the reverse of it. So,
let's just copy and paste this right
here over here. And then we can just get
rid of the things that we created here.
So, I'm just going to three cursors with
alt controll x. Get rid of that. And
then we can make it faster on the way
back. So, we can just do something like
this. Okay. So, yeah. Okay. Now, we need
to make some adjustments to the render
function. Here, I messed up. We don't
want to play the the animation on the
current hovered object. We want to play
it for the current intersect object. So,
every time we intersect the new object,
that's when we're going to play the
animation. The current hovered object
will be the object that is in a hover
state and this will keep track of when
our mouse leaves and when it does we'll
play it but we'll play the go back to
original scale and set this second
parameter to false. So what we want to
do is current intersect object and then
let's check if current intersect object
does not equal equal the current hovered
object which means we changed objects.
So then we can move this in over here.
Then we want to play the new animation
for the new currently intersecting
object. If that makes sense. Now we also
need to update the current hovered
object after we play the hovered
animation to the current intersected
object that we're then for the current
hovered object. If we're playing this
new one, then we can set the old one to
play back to its original scale stuff.
So then we'll just check if current. So,
if current hovered object like so, and
we'll just do play hover animation.
Maybe that's not the best function name.
Whoops. Anyway, we'll pass in the
current hovered object this time and
we'll set it to false. So, trigger that
else statement and play this one going
back to its initial state. And then in
the event that there is no current
intersect object and no current hovered
object means we're not hovering
anything, we want to set everything back
to null. So again, just like over here
with our else statement with the
document body style doc cursor default,
we just want to paste if current hovered
object here. Then we'll set it play
again. And then we this time we want to
set the current hovered object equal to
null. Just like so. Okay. So if I go
back and take a look, it seems to be
partially working. If I leave before the
animation continues, it's not playing.
And that makes sense because of this
guard clause right here with is
animating. it's just going to remain
true and then it's just going to cancel
it out. So what we can do instead is
actually do gap.kill
twins. So we can do gap.kill twins twins
twins of and we'll do object.scale
object.scale cuz we're we're attaching
twins to object.scale. Right? This is
what we're targeting right here. As well
as object rotation. And if you have
position, you can do that as well. I'm
actually going to do that for position
as well because I feel like I'm going to
plan to do that in the future. uh just
probably off camera or something. And
then we actually don't need this user
data thing here at all. And let me just
so let's also get rid of child user data
right there as well. Okay. So basically
what's happening here is once this is
playing if we leave our mouse initially
g it's going to trigger this play hover
animation and it's going to kill that
tween. So it'll take whatever partial it
is. Let's say like we start at scale of
one and it's at like 1.1 when our mouse
leaves. Gab is just going to kill this
tween and then play this tween instead,
right? Because we're no longer hovering
it. And it'll just take that scale that
it paused at and then immediately just
go to the initial scale. So, this should
be working now. So, now if I go back,
you can see I can hover over everything
and it'll it'll work perfectly fine just
like so. So, here you can actually see
this is why you probably need different
versions for rotations because some of
these, you know, they don't see they
don't feel good with the same animation
here. So here you can see I also have an
issue because I had overlap. Those areas
are black. So that's something I'm going
to be fixing in Blender. We already know
how to fix that. You can adjust your UVs
or you can paint over it. And let's just
go into local view over here. Let's just
see. So it's just the top face over
here. It's just the top few faces over
here. Let's just hit period key just to
see where that is. And I feel like we
can just possibly bring it forward just
like that. That actually looks pretty
nice. Also, if you want to add two loop
cuts here and just move that section,
you could totally do that as well. But I
don't think I need to do that. And I
don't want to add that extra geometry.
So, let's just see where this is. So,
people are barely going to look at the
back here. We could probably use like a
knife tool and slice through it. If you
don't know what a knife tool is, that's
totally fine. Um, but I think what I'm
going to do is just honestly just maybe
uh I think I'm just I don't know what
this is. I think that's the roof, but
I'm just going to use the roof back
instead. And yeah, that solves our issue
as well. Of course, it's not seamless,
but very, very few people are going to
be paying that much attention here. I
don't know if this is an issue or if we
even see the bottom, but let's just hit
period key to jump to it. And if you
can't jump to it, it likely means that
these are not on the same area on the UV
map. So, these probably are. So, these
are not. So, let's see. Where is this
one? Oh, this one is also part. So, we
can move that here. And then this one.
And this one. And this one. Hopefully
these are in the same area. Yes, they
are. So here. So for this one, I can
also just move it to like our
wherever that is there. So yeah, again,
we're wasting texture space by baking
that area because we're not even using
it anymore. But oh well, fast solutions.
And honestly, we could probably only
have baked one sign and then just use
that sign's texture and not bake any of
the other ones. that would have probably
saved up a lot of texture space and we
could have put like a lot of stuff. So
yeah, just do it for the other signs and
I'll see you on the other side. And then
again, now is the time to add your other
hover effects and you can just check for
that. Basically what what I'm probably
going to do off camera is like do scale
factor scale factor and have a lot of
other things like want scaling equal
true and then if I want scaling then
I'll do the scaling and if I want
rotation then I'll also do the rotation
and then this value will be determined
like if object.name name contains v2
like we already know converge contains
hover so does it contain v2 if it does
then scale factor equals like 1.5 and
then scale factor would just be here and
then I'll just update scale factor based
on the object name or ID or whatever you
want so I'm not going to show that
because it's mainly just if statement
checks but that's what I'm going to be
doing off camera there. All right, let's
disable orbit controls and raycaster
when the model is open. So what I'm
going to do is just have some sort of
state variable. So probably honestly it
doesn't really matter where and just do
let is modal open is model open and
we'll set that to false by default. And
then if it is in show model what we can
do actually let's just put it above the
show and hide stuff. We can set is modal
equal to true and we can just
controls.enabled and set that to true.
Again those are the orbit controls that
we had. Sorry I mean false. We should
set that to false because we want to
disable it. And then we can just copy
and paste this into hide model as well.
But this time we're going to set this to
true. And we're going to set this to
false. And now in our render function,
all we have to do is just have a guard
clause or an if statement for our
raycaster. So let's see where is our
raycaster stuff. It's right here. So if
does not equal. So if it's false means
that we can do this. We can check for
the ray cer and we should just be able
to place it right. Now, this seems to
start glitching out everything, and
that's probably because when we bypass
the raycast caster logic, none of this
stuff is being set. So, it's like
messing up. So, what we can do is come
over back into show model and update all
this stuff.
So, if current hovered object, then we
can just do the raycast caster stuff
here. Play hover animation current
hovered object, and we'll set that to
false. And then we'll just set the
current hovered object equal to null.
And then we can also just set
document.body
style cursor. And we can set that back
to default. And we can set that back to
default. And then we can also clear all
the current intersect objects. And we
just set that equal to an empty array.
And now if I go back. Cool. It works.
Now, if you want to wait to enable
controls, you can put it on on here.
Like if you had some extra animation or
something that you wanted to like wait
until you went back to your original
position and then you enable controls
again, you could totally do that here as
well. Also forgot to mention, don't
forget that we need to also put is model
open here. Whoops, sorry. Is model open?
And if it is, then we just want to
return guard clause for touch start and
touch end. Because if you have like an
overflow on your model that's open, it
will prevent that default scrolling
behavior where you like touch and drag
to scroll. So that would require you to
use the scroll bar instead of just
touching. And the scroll bar might
glitch out a little bit. So make sure to
have this guard clause here as well for
the touch start and touch end event
listeners. All right. Now, let's limit
our controls so they don't see the back
of this area. So if you remember when we
first started our camera started like
smack dab right over here. So that means
if if our camera spawned over somewhere
over here over there. So the origin is
somewhere over there which means we want
a maximum of 90° in this way. By default
a maximum of 90° this way is already in
place. But we can also go underneath the
surface. So here we actually want a
minimum of 0°.
So we just have to set this and this.
And if you want to be explicit, you can
set the top one as well. So the polar
angles, you know, just like north pole,
south pole, if you want to be explicit
about it, you can set it. So for
definitely the min angle, we can do
controls dominar angle. Min polar angle.
And we're going to set that to zero. So
now we can't go below the floor. And
then we can set the max. So like when we
drag down instead, we can set it to math
pi / 2
or 90°. Right? Just like on the unit
circle over here, pi / by two, like so.
And then again, if you don't know where
these properties are, you can go to the
orbit controls documentation, and it'll
tell you what these actually stand for.
And then I want to set the left. Oh
yeah, I forgot to mention, but when we
go left, we don't want to go any
rotation. So we're also going to set
that to zero. So we'll call that minumth
angle. That's what they call it. And
we're going to set that to zero. So we
can't go any further left. And then
controls domax, a zero angle. And again
that will also be math.py / two. So now
if I go back you can see I can't go left
anymore beyond this. And over here yes
our camera starts here but those
properties are relative to the camera
starting position. So you can see that
we can't go below and we can't go above
and we can't go to the right. Super
cool. So we're kind of constrained here.
Now, another thing I want to limit is
the distance that they can go in and out
because if they keep going too far, you
know, then they'll see emptiness. So, we
can change that. We can also prevent how
close they get. Again, these are also
properties in the documentation. And
I'll set this to like five. And then
controls domax distance. I don't know.
I'm just going to take a wild guess and
say like 50 or something. So, now you
can see if I dolly in, I can't go any
for closer beyond this point. So, maybe
you want them to go closer. I don't
know, kind of up to you. And then when I
go farther away, this is going to be the
maximum that I'm looking for. And then
on mobile, this seems to be okay for
mobile as well. So the next thing I want
to do is limit how much they pan because
I don't want them to like pan off over
here, you know, into oblivion. Now, the
way we do that is by limiting the
target. So by default, orbit controls
has, you know, well, we have a camera,
right? And then orbit controls has this
thing called a target that it looks at.
So if we constrain the target to a
certain location and the target only can
move within this location then we
essentially also limit you know how much
a user can pan. Okay. So in order to do
that it's easier just to edit orbit
controls. So hold control and just like
click here just to quickly jump to orbit
controls code. And you can see here this
is all the orbit controls code. So let's
just copy this and let's come into our
own area source. Over here, we can
create a new folder called utils. And
then we'll just call this orbit
controls.js.
Let's just paste this in here. And then
for our main.js, instead of importing it
from our node modules package, we'll
just do slash
utils/orbit
controls.js
just like so. And you can see it still
works. Cool. Let's go to the orbit
controls that we created. Make sure
you're not in the node modules one.
Okay. So in our orbit controls, let's
just you can put it anywhere. We're
going to create a min and max pan. So
let's do const min pan and we'll just
set it equal to a new vector 3. This
time we're not using dot notation
because they imported it with object
deconstruction. When we did it, we did
import everything as three. So that's
why we're doing three dot vector 3 in
here. But here they deconstructed it. So
now we don't have to do three dot. So
now we can just set some stuff. I don't
know, maybe I'm just going to guess
maybe likegative 1gative 1gative -2
something like so. And then here I want
them to be able to go up in the y- axis
like 5 units and then you know maybe a
little bit on you know this will just be
the other corner pretty much. So we can
try something like this and let's change
this to max pan. And now what we want to
do is find the area where the pan is
being set. So there's probably some sort
of this.target area or something.
So if we look for target.
Yeah, we have this.target. So this is
where at some point they're probably
setting this somewhere. So we can just
search for that. Let's see
this dot move target to pan location.
Cool. So okay. So we should be able to
just clamp over here. So now we can just
do this.target.clamp clamp and we'll put
our min pan and our max pan in here like
so. And again, a clamp is a vector 3
method as you can see that I'm hovering
over there, which you can also find in
the documentation if you need to. So now
if I go back here, you can see that my
pan is limited. I can go a little bit to
the right and then over here I can't go
any more below that. Cool. And I can't
go any more above five. So if you want
to increase that, I feel like I want to
increase that. You can definitely play
around with this. I definitely want to
be and I can see I can go much higher.
So yeah, just play around with it until
you get something that you like. Okay,
so now what I want to do is have some
intro animations. So basically, you
know, once we load on the page, you
know, things animate in like this over
here, just to catch the user intention,
you know, areas that they can click on
later. So before I talk about that, I
just want to talk about you'll notice a
few things like the fish going up and
down and the chair going left and right
and why I didn't show that. And the
reason I'm not covering that in this
video is primarily because it's very
very similar to when we were doing the
fans. Basically, I created a variable
and then I checked for the name and then
I just set that child and then I just
set that variable equal to the child if
they find it. And then in my render
function, I just animated like so.
There's not much different than what we
did with the X and Yaxis fans. Now, you
might be looking at this and thinking
like, wow, this is extremely tedious.
You have to check for the chair name
every time. You have to check for the
chair. You have to assign a variable.
You have to do all this thing. That's
kind of extremely tedious. Is there a
better way to do that? And the answer is
actually yes. And the reason I didn't do
it in this video is probably because I
wasn't planning to animate so many
things, honestly. Um, but the the
general idea is when it comes to your
naming convention, what you can do is,
you know, like our names, they're like
really long like ray caster and then
like third and so on so forth. The the
idea instead of having to always check
the name and always creating a variable
and all that sort of stuff is you just
create like an object and you'll just
call it like const items, you know,
whatever you want to call it. And then
you can use like a split string or
regress, you know, however you want to
split up your string. And this like
first part can be like your key or your
object. So it'll just automatically
generate a key called chair top for you.
And then you can also check what other
things are included that string like ray
caster third so on so forth and then
associated with that you can have those
specific properties. So here you can
have like the mesh which would just be
the child itself. So you would
automatically generate the child. So
instead of having to always create a
variable and accessing it you can just
do items you know chair top chair top
mesh. That way you don't have to you
know create so many variables and then
any any item you want to do you can do
that. And then have other properties
like raycaster and then maybe true. It
doesn't have to be boolean. It could
just be a string too like raycaster
raycaster. Otherwise it'll be like null
or something if it doesn't have the
hover effect. And then when you check if
it has raycaster you don't have to check
if you know check for the name again. So
on so forth. You can just do items.
Chair top does you know. Raycaster. And
if it's null honestly just don't even
put it in the object. That way it would
just then you just go through the list
of items and then check if and then you
just check you know like does chair top
have the property of raycast like if you
know if items do chairtop raycaster and
then if it doesn't then it's like oh
okay it doesn't have raycaster so don't
do anything about it and obviously you
know when you have a loop this wouldn't
be manual this would just be you know
whatever item you put in here this would
just be the key that's going through the
loop right so this way you don't have to
create so many variables and check for
it and do all that stuff over and over
in. And honestly, if I knew I was going
to animate this these many things, I
probably would have done that in the
first place. But I just thought that,
hey, we just doing it one time, it's not
a big deal. But, you know, now it's
becoming a little bit of a big deal. But
that's totally okay. And it's kind of
too late to change it because we would
have to change a lot of things. So,
we're just going to finish out this
video just by creating more variables
for our final animated objects. Yes,
it'll be a little bit tedious, but, you
know, copy and pasting helps a little
bit. So, one thing I definitely want to
animate, like I said earlier, is these
planks in here and then these coming in
here. And then I guess everything else
is kind of a little bit more optional,
but the reason particularly not only for
visual appearance, but also to, you
know, let the user know what are going
to be the more primary areas for you to
click on. So, in order to animate these
to a scale of one, well, then we have to
set an initial scale for all of them to
be zero or however you want to animate
it. So it could be a rotation that you
set initially as well. So I'm not going
to bore you with typing that out. But
here you can see that I just found my
name and then I set the child scale and
then I set all the variables here equal
to the child as I go through there. If
we find it now again you'll see a lot of
redundant code here. And yes, this isn't
great. You could also go back into your
Blender file and for each of the things
you want to animate, you can do
underscorean animate, you know, and then
check for that and then set all the
scales with animate to 00 or whatever
you want, you know, like if animate and
hanging plank_1,
then do this instead. Otherwise, you
know, just set 000 here. You know, it's
like we're just hard coding everything.
And again, and yeah, like like I said
earlier, you know, I would definitely go
for a more automatic approach than what
we're looking at right here, but you
know, it's totally okay because at least
at least uh at least you know, people
know what we're doing here. So, it's a
little bit crazy and you know, people
are going to judge you for it, but you
know, it works and um you know, at least
it's it's it's readable in a sense.
Okay. So, now what I want to do is
create a function like play intro
animation. So, I'm just going to do play
intro animation, but name it whatever
you want. And I'll play it as soon as we
add our GB scene or scene. We're going
to later move this after our custom
loading screen is done. So, I'll just
come over here and do function play
intro animation like so. And I want the
side over here to play at the same time
as my Boba stuff over here. So, what we
can do is create two GSAP timelines. One
for the set over here and one set for
over here. If you want to, you don't
have to use Gap timelines at all and you
can just like hardcode when it animates
in and that would work perfectly fine as
well. Additionally, you could use one
Gap timeline rather than two different
ones and then adjust the timing factors
on the single one rather than two.
Again, that's really up to you. I'll be
doing two timelines, one for here, one
for here. Now, you might be asking,
okay, if you have three different ways
to approach this when it comes with
GSAP, which one's best? And for this
specific idea, for this specific
project, all three of them are perfectly
valid and they're probably equal in
terms of complexity. Honestly, it's
probably just your up to your preference
at this point. If you wanted to, again,
you could also go back into Blender and
give them IDs and names to automatically
generate a timeline for you in a
specific order rather than hard- coding
it yourself. However, I will be hard
coding it just so it's a little bit
clear. So, the first thing I'm going to
be doing is creating a const T1 gap
timeline. These have timeline like so.
And I want to set some defaults which
means every time we play an animation,
it has these certain animation features.
So one is probably duration and I'll set
that to 0.8. So every time one of the
meshes scale, it'll take about it'll
take 0.8 seconds. I also want to do the
same thing with their ease. All the
eases will be back dot out. And I want
to probably probably put in a intensity
of like 1.8. Again, if you don't want a
consistent ease, you can actually just
replace the ease in the timeline itself
and it will override the default. Cool.
So now what we can do is use T1.2. So 2
and GB just takes your original value
and goes to the new value. So we'll do
plank one scale, which is what I call
hanging plank one. And I'm going to set
its Z to one and its X to one as well.
You can see that that's exactly what we
get. And now we can just do method
chaining. So we can just do two. Again,
if you want to split it up to T1.2,
T1.2, so on and so forth, you could
totally do that. But I'm just going to
be using method chaining. Okay. So let's
do plank 2.cale
like so. Come over here. And this time I
want to set all X, Y, and Z to one. So
let's just go in order X and then Y and
then set it to one. And then we might as
well finish it up right now. So I'm just
going to paste that. Paste it again.
Paste it again. This one will be work
button. This one will be I think it's a
bad button. Yes. Cool.
And then this one will be contact
button. So if I go back it should play
in. It comes in goes down up like so.
And you can see that comes just like
that. And uh we have an issue. And
that's makes sense because we are saving
in our user data the initial scale
position and rotation. So that means all
we have to do is just move this below
that. So let's see. Hopefully that is
outside of
this ray caster. Let's see. It's right
here. Yeah. So, we should just be able
to move it below this and everything
should be fine. Yep. And now everything
is back to working. Cool. So, it copies
So, it copies the original scale before
we set it back to 0 0. Super cool. Now,
I don't like how it goes one at a time.
I want them to sort of overlap with each
other. And the way to do that is by
using relative values related to your
previous animation or your forward
animation. And you also have absolute
values as well that you can use of if
you want to as well. But for us, we're
going to be using relative values, which
means it's going to be relative to
something. In this case, it'll be to our
previous animation in the timeline line.
And here you can see there's a lot of
different ways to do that. And then
maybe for plank 2, I want to start a
little bit early at plank one scaling.
So we can do like minus= 0.5 seconds. So
essentially this should start at 0.3
seconds in plank 1.scale and then we can
just copy that for these other ones. I
don't know if so I don't know if I want
to offset it any differently. So we can
just copy it to the other ones as well.
So now if I go back it should play.
It seems like the easing is not working.
So let's take a look if I messed up
somewhere. And indeed I did. I don't
have the defaults object that we need to
put our defaults in. Whoops. So let's
just move that into our defaults object.
And now you can see it works
appropriately.
Cool. Now I want these to play a little
bit faster on their own animations cuz
right now it seems a little bit too
slow. So we can just change this to like
0.6 like so.
And now you can see we kind of get a
more nice effect. Now for the boba and
the work items, we can actually do the
same exact thing. So we can just copy
and paste this. Again, I would probably
automate this in the future rather than
what we're doing, but you know, it's
totally okay. So here we can change this
to T2. And then we can change this one
to T2 as well. And we can change this to
Boba. And Boba also has a scale uh this
time of Y as well of zero. So we're
going to set that to one. Then we can
change plank 2 to GitHub YouTube like
so. and then Twitter.
Twitter and then we don't have anything
after that. So, we can just get rid of
this. So, now if I go back and refresh
the page, you can see they're playing at
the same exact time. Super super cool.
Super cute. Super awesome. Also, by the
way, if you get something that you
really like, except it goes a little bit
too fast. You don't have to, you know,
hate your life and then go back and
change every single value. There's
actually this thing in Gap called time
scale where you can just like set the
time scale for it. So here you can just
see after every time I created the
timeline, I just gave it a scale of 80%.
So 80% speed. Of course you can change
that per your timeline. Here you can see
it plays 20% slower. Super super cool,
just how I like it. Okay, so now I just
want to talk about my loading screen
here. So if I refresh the page, you can
see loading and then I can hit this
enter button and then I'll enter and
just like so. So I want to briefly talk
about how I did that. So the first thing
is I needed some styles here. So what I
did was I made the entire loading screen
a little bit larger than the screen
itself. And that's because I wanted the
border to not be visible initially from
the start. Especially because I have a
border radius. And if you have a border
radius, the tiny little corners there
would show. So I made it expand a little
bit out of the viewport. Additionally, I
kind of like the style better when the
loading screen didn't have a border
around it, which is why I don't have a
border here. And yes, I know I'm mixing
pixels and rims and things like that.
It's not the prettiest code, but I am uh
my prototyping habits die hard. For the
intro stuff, I used the loading manager.
So, here you can see that in 3GS.
Basically, you just attach it to your
con loader. So I created my manager
loader and I just attached it to the
gltf loader. So here you can see I just
passed in my manager to that glTF loader
and that's pretty much all you did. And
then just like the gltf loader then
we're loading our models. This also has
a onload callback function that you can
do something you know once the loading
is completed. So that's all I did here.
I just set once everything was done
loading I just set a bunch of styles and
then also you know when it's done
loading what I did was I add some event
listeners to loading screen button so
that way I can click on it and then it
triggers this handle enter event which
sets some more styles it also changes
the favi icon and then play some music
which I didn't talk about but I will get
to in a little bit and then it plays
this another function here called play
reveal and this just is another timeline
where I take loading screen, do some
animations to it. You might be
wondering, okay, how did I know this
looked good? How do you know what that
is at all? And honestly, I don't know,
honestly. I was just trying things until
I got something that I like. These are
just 3D CSS properties. You know, you
might just go for a basic opacity. You
might go for a reveal effect, you know,
a clip path animation. It's it's really
up to you. But one thing that's
important here is when it's done
animating, you want to remove the
loading screen from your DOM, not just
hide it. So that's why when the
animation is done I am loading screen
over here and now you can see instead of
adding it after this scene.gb sorry
scene.add
I removed that and then I put play intro
animation on complete of the play reveal
animation. So just again you can see I
just changed the button styles here and
then as soon as it's done playing it
plays the intro animations with all the
meshes animating in. So when it comes to
audio uh I like to use how.js JS because
it helps you know standardize things
across different devices and browsers.
It's fairly simple. You just create like
a how and then there's a lot of things
that you can do with it like yeah you
just navigate there and then you can use
you know like play so it should be play.
Yeah here you can see play when I click
it starts playing the music and here you
can also see I have like volume so you
can set the volume. Uh yeah that's
pretty much it. I feel like I'm going to
clean up some of the code, you know,
hopefully by the time this video is
released and then but for the rest of
it, it's mainly just CSS styling and
then a lot of bunch of other Gap stuff
that we already know how to do. It just,
you know, it's just a bunch of time
consuming stuff. Oh, actually, sorry,
one last thing that I didn't mention is
to make the starting responsive. What I
did is I just had one initial check, you
know, just below my controls on
window.in width. If it's less than 768
pixels, then I'm setting this target in
position. Otherwise, I kept our same
desktop one over here with some slight
modifications. That way, when they're on
mobile, the entire room is in frame
because if you leave this by default,
it'll be too close. Maybe whatever your
scene is going for, your desktop also
works for your mobile version, but mine
didn't. So, I set my camera a little bit
farther back. And this only runs once
and it only checks once. This is not a
on resize sort of thing. Okay. So now
what we can do is just push. So as like
set starting just so I have a camera
here. I mean a comment that I can push
or something. So we can just make well I
was pushing off camera but we can just
make one last push here and just do
let's go epicio. Let's do this. Woo.
Woo. All right. That's awesome. And then
we can just get push. Get push. And then
since we already deployed it earlier in
the video, it should automatically
deploy to Verscell. Yeah. So that's
pretty much it for the video. I guess I
just wanted to some final comments and
shout out to my Patreon supporter. Shout
out to Jason L. Thank you for supporting
me on Patreon. If you'd like to support
the videos that I do, you know,
definitely please check me out. Maybe
I'll post some more extra tips and
tricks here or something like that. Of
course, if you need help, you can always
email me. I am most active on Discord.
So if you need help, you know,
definitely reach out to me through
Discord. That would be my preferred
communication method. Email is totally
fine as well. So, you know, some future
challenges you could probably do like
this piano or like these fish and these
other things that I didn't cover in this
video, like we know how to target the
fish. And then we also know about the
sign function and things like that. So,
you could consider how to do that. Same
thing with the piano. You can imagine
that the origin points are over there.
When you download the blend roof file,
you'll notice that all the origin points
for the black keys are at their top over
there. So, all I did in Gab was just
rotate it and scale it when I clicked on
there, just like so. Yeah. So,
definitely share what you create. It
doesn't have to be a room. You know, tag
me. I'd love to see it. And um I guess I
will also mention that there's a lot of
things that you see that I did not
cover, like this coffee steam. This is
actually from Bruno Simon, a very very
popular, he's one of the most, if not
the most popular 3JS developer, and he
has this really awesome course that I
highly recommend. I'm not sponsored by
him in any way. I just really really
recommend it. And even if you don't
learn anything from the lessons, the
community that you get is well worth the
price. So, you know, if you have some
money, you know, definitely purchase it.
And it it goes on sale often for like
Easter and uh a lot of really big
holidays. So, you know, definitely keep
a lookout for that. I just mentioned
Easter because I feel like that's the
closest holiday here in the United
States. You also noticed that I have
night and theme toggle between switching
between day and night textures. This is
also a shader. You can see it over in
here theme. I was planning to cover in
this video, but I decided not to, but
the code is there if you want to take a
look. However, I do plan in my next
video to cover shaders. So, yeah. Thanks
so much for watching. Hopefully, you
enjoyed. Hopefully, you learned
something. uh you know definitely tag me
when you create something and post it on
social media. I'd love to see it and I'm
sure a lot of other people would really
love to see it as well. Again, thanks so
much for watching and I hope to see you
in my next video. Take care. Peace out.

transform messy, hard to maintain
JavaScript code into clean, readable,
and professional quality code that
scales. This course is created by Tapas.
He'll help you understand what code
smell is, why it matters, and how to
refactor step by step using proven clean
code principles, real examples, and
modern tooling like ESLint and prettier.
You'll learn to write code that is
maintainable, elegant, and futureproof.
Hey, how are you doing? I am Tapus from
India. Extremely delighted to bring this
session in front of you. You could call
it as a crash course to understand what
is code smell and how to make your code
clean. I consider this topic is very
fundamental in terms of software
engineering, software development and
that's the motivation to bring it in
front of you. Before we get started, a
brief introduction about myself. By
education, I'm a computer science and
engineering grad and by profession I'm a
software engineer. I have spent two
decades building products, software
services and delighted many customers
across the globe. Currently I'm working
really hard to push my dream startup
called Creovis and beside that whenever
I get time I love teaching and I teach
about software engineering, fullstack
engineering, software development,
everything that is fundamental. You can
check out my YouTube channel Tapascript.
I'm also a contributor to free codec cam
news with articles and the handbook
since last four years and also started
to contribute on their YouTube channel
and that's how I am here today. With
that let us now get into the session
agenda to understand what are we going
to learn today. We will start the
session with why clean code matters. Why
we have to think about clean code and
then we want to put some learning
objectives. See this is very important.
Everything that you'll be learning from
session, it should be the value of your
time. It means that you should have
certain objectives around that you can
map with everything that we'll be
learning in this session. Very
essential, right? And then we'll be
talking about very basic software
development life cycle and the coding
phases because this session itself is
related to coding. After that, we're
going to talk about the core of the
topic is code smell. I'm going to
explain to you what code smell means and
then why code smell is really really
bad. Then we'll be getting into
something called a clean code. Then a
very important topic how to detect code
smell. And the more experienced you
become as a developer you have to learn
how to detect code smell and how to tell
your peers even to yourself that this
particular piece of code doesn't look
good. After that we'll be talking about
the common code smell in JavaScript. So
the course mail and the clean code the
concept of it is programming language
agonistic. It is not related to a
programming language very strongly.
However, while demonstrating it, we need
certain programming language. I am most
familiar with JavaScript and TypeScript.
So I'll be showing you a a few common
code smell using JavaScript. The similar
code smells you are going to find in
Python or any other programming
languages as well. After that I'm going
to show you how can you refactor those
code smell to make them as clean code.
I'm going to give you certain best
practices to follow and then going to
leave you with few fantastic resources
that you can follow even after this
course. After that I'm going to give you
certain task and assignments so that you
can practice whatever you have learned.
Once you make it practice you find the
pattern and you become very confident
about it. One thing to call out if you
are a beginner to programming or have
spent only a few years in software
development I would suggest to go slow
in this session try to grasp everything
that we are discussing over here try to
take good notes and try to revisit them
later point in time if you're aware of
these concepts already it will be a
great opportunity for you to brush up
the same concepts and you can even go in
1.5x speed if you want
[Music]
Writing code is easy but writing good
code that's the challenge. Many projects
fail not because the code doesn't run
but because no one can understand and
maintain that code in a long run. I have
seen teams where adding a new feature
brings lot of chaos and after some point
in time debugging become real nightmare.
I like this analogy. Think your code
like your kitchen. If the kitchen is
clean, you become a master chef. You
enjoy cooking. But if the kitchen is
messy, you have to waste time in finding
things. You will make mistakes. You will
lose patience. And the outcome, which is
the food, is not going to be good at
all. Hence, the purpose of this session
is to make you aware of those
nitty-gritty in our code that we usually
put. we ignore them which will be
sitting inside the code and then spread
certain smell over the period of time
and going to create a lot of problem in
the long run. I hope you find it
meaningful.
[Music]
Before we dive in, here is what you will
be able to do by the end of this course.
These are the objectives that you need
to map to everything that we'll be
talking about in this session. At the
end of the session, you will be able to
identify common JavaScript code smell in
real code. And if you understand the
pattern, you will be able to identify
the similar code smell in other language
syntaxes as well. Then you will be able
to explain why each smell is harmful.
And this is for folks who take parts in
code reviews. You can review yourself
your code or you can review somebody
else's code. Both the time it is
important that you not only detect but
also articulate that why certain code is
a code smell and going to create harm in
the long run. Then you will be able to
apply practical refactoring knowledge to
turn the smelly code into a clean code.
You will be able to use simple tools
techniques to make a code smell to a
clean code. and then you'll be able to
complete at least three task and
assignments that I'll be giving you to
boost your confidence in case you were
not aware of these concepts. So please
keep these objectives in mind. Take note
of the things that we'll be learning and
then try to draw a pointer from the
things that we'll be learning to each of
these objectives to see whether your
learning objectives are meeting or not.
All right, with all these goals set,
let's place coding and refactoring in
context. Where do this practice really
fit in in the software development life
cycle, which is SDLC?
[Music]
Most of you probably already know about
SDLC. Software development life cycle.
Software development life cycle consists
of a bunch of phases. What are those
phases? The first phase comes where the
planning comes to build your software.
You start doing planning and then you
get requirement from your customer. You
start doing those requirement analysis.
Once the analysis is done, what you do?
You start getting into doing the design
and architecture. Once the design and
architecture reach to a stage, you are
supposed to start the implementation
which is also known as the coding phase.
As the coding phase goes on either along
with the coding phase or after the
coding phase based on the kind of model
software engineering development model
you are following you start testing and
quality assurance program and then once
the software is baked or a part of the
software a feature is baked you think
about deploying it. Once the deployment
is done it means that your software is
in the hand of your customers your end
users but that's not the end. You have
to put more features. If customer finds
issues you have to fix them that's why
there is another important phase called
maintenance come into picture. So in
STLC if you see coding is one of the
phase among many planning requirements
design testing deployment maintenance
are also there. However many of us as a
developer we stop here because it's
coding. This is directly related to the
job that we do every day. But in the
real world, maintainability is what
makes a project successful. It doesn't
mean that all the other six phases that
we have discussed so far are not
important. All these phases are very
important. But I'm talking about the
focus. As a developer, we give lot of
focus in coding. But we need to keep our
eyes, our ear open to make sure that we
understand where our coding going to. It
is going to till the phase of
maintenance. So for a successful
project, maintenance also plays a very
very important role. We all need to
understand that coding is not just about
typing and matching the syntax. It is
more than that. It is about describing
something to human and also to the
machine. Now that we know where coding
fits, let's talk about the enemy. Let's
talk about code smell.
[Music]
The term codemell was popularized by
Martin Fowler and Kent Beck. First thing
to clarify codes doesn't mean that your
code is broken. But it means that
something is off, something is not
right. It is kind of a hint that deeper
inside there is a problem that might be
existing which can cause a bigger
problem tomorrow if not taken care
immediately. To give you an analogy
again, think of it like you have a car
and the car is making a noise every day.
Whenever you're taking the car out, it
still runs perfectly on the road.
However, the noise increases every day.
Now, if you are not paying attention to
that noise, it can result into anything.
It could be resulting into making the
car completely stopped on the road in
the dark and you get lot of trouble. So
what you will be doing as a car owner,
you will be trying your best to fix that
noise as soon as possible, taking it to
a mechanic or fix it by yourself. That
noise is what exactly the code smell in
terms of software engineering. So if we
have to define code smell, we can define
it in this way. Course smell is any
surface level indication in the code
that suggest a deeper problem in design
or maintainability. Okay, your code will
work but there might be a problem that
you may be overlooking today which can
come back as a boomerang tomorrow to
cause more trouble. Can you see some
examples right away? Yes, we can look
into this. This is a code which is with
bad indentation and it lacks spacing.
Whenever we seeing somebody's code, we
would love to see that code formatted in
a better way because if the formatting
is missing, it takes away lot of
readability. And not only that, if
somebody has to come tomorrow and start
working on this piece of code, they'll
be really frustrated because there is no
proper formatting and there are high
chances that there might be missing of
certain operators like equals, greater
than sign, plus sign can result into lot
of bugs over the period of time. Here is
an example of a function sum. It works
perfectly. Whenever you pass two
parameters to it, it just sum up those
two number and then assign that to a
variable called result and return that
result variable from the function. Works
great but it doesn't look great and
there is a high possibility that it is
going to give us back certain kind of
problem tomorrow. Let's see one more
look into this particular smell here.
Long function doing many things. So
there is a function called handle order.
What is it doing? It is validating
input, checking inventory, calculate
total, processing the payment, sending
the email, updating the analytics. Okay,
I can understand that validating the
inventory, checking the inventory,
calculating the total, these are kind of
related to a order. How sending an email
is a generic thing, right? You can send
an email for an order, you can send the
email for anything else. Updating the
analytics can happen for any operation
in the system. Not necessarily that it
has to be clubbed with a single big fat
function handle order. Correct? So this
is another concern or another smell that
we find very often in our code where we
have to think about the responsibility
of each of the function and try to break
them into smaller function to make them
elegant and maintainable. Let's take one
more look into this. Here we are super
confident developer. Here we think JSON
string the parameter that we pass to
JSON.parassse is something that is
always going to be parsed. But what if
we pass something by mistake which is
not parsible and going to throw a
runtime error. We are not handling that
runtime error at all. We are ignoring a
potential error. These are the code
smell that I'm talking about. These are
like those weird noises that we get from
the car needs attention. This still
works but this needs attention. So if it
still works, we have to know why to
worry about it. It still works, right?
[Music]
Code smell is bad because you know smell
spreads. One bad function inspires
another. We as a developer we like
productivity. If we see something is
there and I can reuse the first
intention that I have in my mind is I'm
going to copy that and I'm going to use
that. What if the thing that I'm copying
is written with smell the bad function
that's what I'm copying and when I'm
copy pasting it elsewhere means I'm
using it elsewhere I'm spreading that
smell across my codebase so one bad
function inspires another and smell
spread so it is always good to catch
that early remove it make it clean
second it slows down development because
code smell ultimately going to give you
bugs the more bugs you have the more
time you need to deliver a feature and
of course it is going to scare lot of
new members, new team members. People
you know come with lot of their own
experiences in terms of coding handling
software product. So once they come into
a team and sees the code is full of
smell and if the person is knowledgeable
about course mail have worked a lot with
clean code they will be really scared
seeing such kind of code. And another
true thing is the longer a code mill
stays in your code the more expensive it
becomes because it creates something
called tech depths or technical depths.
What are technical depths? Technical
depths are something that you have
created a feature by following certain
customer use cases. You have delivered
that feature. However, out of that
feature there are lot of bugs. There are
lot of issues that came in. Now the
customer is on top of your head that as
per my SLA with you, you are supposed to
give me a feature that works really
well. Now I have found hundreds of bugs
because of your coding, your lack of
checks, your code smell etc. You have to
now fix those bugs. So these are all
technical depths that you have to fix
and give it back to the customer again.
Tech depths are something paying it off
is really really hard and nobody gives
you extra money for that. Sometime you
don't even get extra time for that. So
please make sure whenever you find a
code smell clean them up. Now take a
look into this code. Here is a function
and the function name suggests that it
is calculating something. It takes three
parameters ptr and it returns a
calculation. What is going on in your
mind when you're seeing this code?
There's nothing wrong syntactically.
Absolutely fine. If you pass three
parameters, if there's a number, it is
going to do some calculation and is
going to return the value to you.
However, there is a code smell. What do
you know? What are PT R? Over time, this
kind of unclear code makes maintenance
really really painful. You don't know
what are PT R. You really don't know
what exactly this function is doing.
What kind of calculation it is. All
these things seems very ambiguous to
someone who is lacking domain knowledge.
Just looking into the code and trying to
rely on the code that somebody has
written and believe that the code is
going to give enough indication of what
exactly this function doing.
Unfortunately, it is not. So this is
about code smell and why code is bad.
Now let's talk about the antidote which
is clean code.
What is a clean code? Clean code is a
code which is easy to read, understand
and modify. Clean code is not just a
short code. Many things that clean code
means a short code. No, it is not just a
short code but it is expressive. It is
predictable and it is intention
revealing means it clearly says what it
is supposed to do. You remember this
code we have seen it just now. The
calculate function with ptr is doing
certain calculation and we identify
together that this is a code smell. Now
if you have to write a clean code
version of this code smell one possible
version of that would be something like
this which clearly says the calculation
is about calculating the simple interest
ptr having very clear naming now P for
principal T for time and R for the rate
and to calculate the simple interest you
have to multiply them and divide by 100
that's the calculation same logic
exactly same logic left and right but
right side one is more like the natural
language which having a very clear
function, clear parameter definitions
and it says very very clearly what
exactly it is doing. So it is intention
revealing. It says what it is doing. It
is expressive. All the name are very
explicit. It is predictable because for
the same principle, same time and same
rate value, it is always going to give
you the same simple interest calculate.
So it's great that from a code smell we
have now refactored it to make a clean
code. But how do you even detect there
is a code smell? Let's look into that.
[Music]
Detecting a smell is about becoming like
a detective.
Okay. So there are few things that I
want to share from experience like how
can you detect a smell in the code.
Always start by the review. Do a self
review of your code. Do you understand
the code? Do you understand the purpose
why you have written? Keep yourself in
the shoe of someone else and try to read
is it clear enough? What exactly it
does? Always go for peer reviews.
Encourage peer reviews in your
organization. Give your code for review
so that other person can review it.
Proactively review the code of someone
else. Then the second thing would be
look for certain signs and symptoms like
code duplication. Whether the code is
getting duplicated in multiple places
and killing reusability. Are the names
unclear that nobody understand? Are
there inconsistent logic around? Look
for those kind of symptoms and sign when
you are doing the review. And then the
third thing is about the tooling. There
are great tools around which you can
plug in into your coding environment
which are going to alert you enough so
that you can be aware of those code
smell while coding itself and can
refactor your code in such a way that
your code become clean. So one of the
tool that I love is called prettier. It
helps a lot in terms of formatting.
There is another tool called eslint. You
know that there are bunch of rules that
it comes with and all those rules are
adjustable variable based on your need.
And what it does is like if there are
certain problem in your code, it is
going to shout out loud with those red
colors right on your editor. Without
this particular code at the right side
will run perfectly. with eslint in
picture it is shouting on every line
saying there are some problems in each
line of this JavaScript code we are
actually going to see this I'm going to
refactor it in a while the tool like
eslint also gives an elaborative report
which you can go through to identify
what's the problem in the code what kind
of code smell that we are dealing with
and you will be able to fix them very
very easily the another way especially
for the javascript folks if you are
using typescript
which is JavaScript plus the type
safety. There are few code spell will be
automatically be removed by TypeScript
itself because TypeScript always care
for types. You cannot randomly pass any
argument for any parameters things like
that which will be always caught early
at the coding level. If you're using
TypeScript also if you're using any
other type language but even if you're
using TypeScript or any other type
language there are certain kind of
smells like duplication of the code
logic inconsistencies like the bad
naming stays for ever if you are not
taking care of them. All right now big
thing let's explore some of the most
common code smells and we'll also see
how to fix them. One quick announcement
for you in case you are liking my
teaching. I think you will be liking
these two courses that I give it for
free. One is called 40 days of
JavaScript. This is a complete
JavaScript course from beginner to pro
and this is a taskdriven course from day
one to day 40. It's a 40 days of
JavaScript. You can check it out. And
there is one more course called 15 days
of React design pattern. Again, it is
for someone who knows a bit about React
but not very confident on how to write
clean code with React. This course is
free and is going to teach you at least
15 design patterns to make sure that
you're very confident with React. So in
case it interest you, the link of both
of them is in the description of this
video. Go ahead and check it out.
I tried to distribute the common code
smells into seven categories. Now there
could be more categories but with my
research reading experience I find these
seven categories are kind of standards
that we can bring any of those codes
smell in any of those bucket. So let's
get started with the first one which is
about the formatting and readability. So
if you have this kind of code smell in
your code it means that you have poor
indentation you are missing spaces you
have inconsistent quotes all this kind
of problem. By the way, we are going to
see example for each of these. But
first, let's get a familiarity with them
by understanding their name and what
kind of quotes mail that they bring in.
So, you understand about the formatting
and readability. The name is
self-explanatory. Second one is about
the name and the structure. It means
that it is misleading variables, unclear
function names, using of magic numbers,
all this kind of problem is in the
naming and structure kind of code smell.
Then about the code complexity, deeply
nested code, deeply nested loops, long
functions, we have seen the example of
it already, too many parameters, you
know, poor modularization of the code,
that kind of thing. Then comes logic and
the maintainability often found
duplicate logic, unclear conditions, not
taking care of the age cases. All these
thing come together in this kind of
smell where logic and maintainability is
crucial. Then comes design and the
architecture. Tight coupling, lack of
cohesion, not much on the performance
optimization. So this kind of thing
comes under design and architecture.
We're going to see code snippet for each
of this. Then comes error handling and
the resilience where we see silent
failures, not using try and catch, you
know, swallowing the errors,
inconsistent error handling, that kind
of thing comes under error handling and
the resilience. And the final one is
about the performance and efficiency,
which is like unnecessary rerendering.
For example, if you're from React
background, you know how crucial
rendering, rerendering is. You might
have blocking loops, expensive DOM
operations. All this kind of thing come
under performance and efficiency. So
these are the seven category. Formatting
and readability, naming and structure,
code complexity, logic and
maintainability, design and
architecture, error handling and
resilience, performance and efficiency
are the buckets where you can fit in
most common code smells. Now let us take
a look into each of them one by one. The
first one is formatting and readability
where it matters. It matters for visual
clarity and the consistency. What kind
of thing that you can think of poor
indentation, missing spaces,
inconsistent quotes, all this kind of
thing. This is the example we have seen
already. This mail is about the bad
indentation and lack of spacing. We have
seen this example. I'm not talking about
it again. Let's take one more. Here it
is very hard, isn't it, to read this.
You have a if condition. Then there is a
bracket and a single line. Bunch of
functions are getting executed one by
one. very very hard to read. Ideally how
you will be doing it you'll be
formatting it properly like each of the
function execution each line the curly
braces goes off there is a space between
if and the parenthesis all this thing
that will be taking care right then this
code look at this there is a function
called save user but to locate that
function save user you will take some
time oh where is that function save user
ah okay it's there why because a simple
function save user which takes a name
and email and then we are making a call
to the database to save that user simple
very selfex-
But there are commands like create user
object assign name an email save to the
database and it seems that for each of
the line of that code there is a comment
that is too much that's overdoing so
over commented code is also a smell
that's what I want to talk about right
this much is a function but this big are
the comments and then mix styles okay so
what does it mean you have a function
which is written in a very traditional
way the grid function see very
traditional grid function pass a name
and it returns hello name and there is
another function by which is written
with JavaScript's arrow function. Here
the reason is same which is like
function creation but you are creating
with the mix styles. It is good to
follow the similar style for function
creation throughout in the codebase. For
example, follow the regular style or the
arrow function whatever matters. You can
go for mix style only when it is
absolutely required. Maybe for certain
cases you have to use arrow function
because the programming has a demand of
it because arrow function and these
handles things differently than the
normal function and the this keyword in
JavaScript at least. So if you have a
different use cases for that makes sense
otherwise in most of the cases try to
follow similar kind of style. Also here
we could have used the template literal
instead of it we have used concatenation
using the plus hello plus name. We could
have used a template literal isn't it?
Then one more code smell on this
category is inconsistent naming. You see
how the variables are named throughout
the application. Somewhere it's called
user name. Somewhere it call user age
like a capital case. Somewhere it it is
is logged in. I don't know which case it
is two words but still it's not a camel
case. L is not capital. Right? So
inconsistent naming is another thing
which is going to create lot of
confusion. Right? So follow these things
properly. remove this code smell to take
care of the formatting and readability
so that it brings visual clarity and
consistency in your code. That's the
first one. Let's go to the second one
which is about naming and structure. And
the purpose of naming and structure is
meaningful naming and the organization
of your code. Samples, misleading
variable names, unclear function names,
magic numbers, etc. Let's see some
examples. This is the first one. Random
naming of files in a JavaScript project.
Follow a pattern, right? When you are
creating certain kind of file maybe a
test file you want to name it as
ABCD.est.js
name test.js all the JS files you might
want to give it a snake case or the
camel case JS but follow the same kind
of naming pattern here you are seeing
the header file JS title case in the
name JS J and S are small then come user
utils do.js JS where J and S are in the
capital letter right that also you need
to be mindful right when you're creating
so it's good to have the standard set in
the team so that this kind of randomness
doesn't exist create chaos in our
codebase next one we have already taken
an example of it while explaining that
calculate function this is another one
right can you tell me what is X and Y
here can anybody guess is it height and
width or it is something else we don't
know so it's always good to be very
explicit about the naming that you are
giving. One of my mentor told me long
long back that if you are in the
programming naming a variable is the
hardest thing and name the variable in a
way you should think that how you'll be
naming your own kid in future. You won't
like to call them as a b c d xyz etc.
You want to call them with some
beautiful names. Treat your variables in
the same way. You'll be happy forever.
So I think that's right and I like to
follow that. So please unclear variable
names are not something that you want to
see. Then look at this function doing
multiple things again. It is sending an
email. It is doing a lock change. There
is something that you can definitely
change over here. And then this one this
particular function create user. How
many parameters it takes? It takes five
I guess 1 2 3 4 5. So someone calling
this create user from wherever possible
has to type all those five arguments to
pass and execute. Can you do something
about this? So this is the problem with
actually the structure. Yes, we can do
we'll be seeing that when you go through
the refactoring for each of these. Okay.
So this is about naming and structure.
This kind of code smell contribute to
disorganization of your codebase. Please
take care of them. Let's go to the next
one which is about the code complexity.
And the purpose of it is to reduce the
cognitive load from the developer
because more complex your code is it put
more load in your brain and it brings
unnecessary complication. We have spoken
about this thing already. Long function
doing many things. A function having
multiple things a big gigantic one.
Anybody trying to review it any change
happen in any portion of the function is
going to be nightmare. Reusability is
killed here because a portion of the
function could have been used elsewhere.
Now for that reason that portion of the
code will be copied and pasted somewhere
else. Now tomorrow if it changes in one
place there is no guarantee someone will
be proactively working on changing in
other place as well. Problem. So why to
get into that problem? Make things
simple. Second thing about this class
similar to the function this is what we
call as got class. It does everything
right? It has many responsibilities
which we can really make it simple. Then
the complex loop logic what this code
snippet is doing basically it is trying
to identify if there is an active user
who is an adult that's it and in that
case it is going to push it to the
active data structure and it is using an
users array doing the loop and all this
thing. Can you break this complex loop
logic into something which is much much
more elegant and easy to read and debug?
Going to see them. And then look at
this. Can you tell me what is 01 and 0.1
here? It's hard. It's little hard. Maybe
0.1 is easy. That is a discount. What is
01? We don't know. So this usage of
magic values, why you call them magic
values? Because nobody knows what are
those. So don't use them. Instead create
constant and use the constant which is
having a very verbose name for each of
these value throughout the application.
And tomorrow if you have to change the
discount from 0.1 to 0.3
and if you have use that 0.1 in 20
places think about the nightmare that
all those 20 places you have to go and
change from 0.1 to 0.3. Why to do that
extra work? Create a constant and
tomorrow if you have to change 0.1 to
0.3 it will be just one place change.
That's it. All right, let's move to the
next one which is about logic and
maintainability. The purpose of this is
how easy is to understand and change
behavior. Okay, so look at this. It's a
pure duplicate code function add user
calling another method another function
called save to DB inside and after that
it's calling log action saving the user
to the DB and logging the action.
function remove user also doing the same
thing saving the user to the DB and log
action exactly same thing just the name
of the function is different but
underlying they're doing the same thing
say duplicate logic can we do something
about it yes we can do something then
about this one here is an unnecessary
temporary variable what we are doing
basically we are multiplying price into
quantity to identify the total value we
could have just written one statement
return price into quantity we don't have
to create another temporary variable
called total unnecessarily because we're
not doing anything with the total right
so that kind of thing then the deeply
nested conditionals look at this first
the check whether user is there then go
inside check if user is active go inside
then check user's role is admin go
inside and finally access admin panel
this code can be simplified can be made
very very short very elegant we're going
to see that then look at this there's a
switch case without a default default
case is missing which can cause trouble
And this one you all know right if you
run JavaScript do you see those two
equals you got to use the three equals
right the strict equality operator than
the loose equality operator. So that's
about the logic and maintainability. Let
us now look into design and architecture
problems. So purpose here is the highle
design issues to be caught. So what kind
of design issues we can see here like
tight coupling lack of cohesion I told
all this premature optimizations. Look
at this code. It mix the responsibility.
There's something called send email
which is sending the email but after
that it is updating the user status and
also adding things to the log which is
not right. Right? And then look at this
code or the next one. Both are kind of
similar like there is a global variable
but somewhere you are mutating the
global variable from a function. Now how
much difficult it is for someone to even
trace back like which function would
have changed the value of my global
variable. I was expecting certain value
for that global variable and I've
written this condition but in between
some other function got called in my
happy path or sad path of the code and
that function it seems that it changed
the value of my global variable and now
it is producing messy code. So global
mutable state function mutates external
variable all these things are design and
architecture problem gets into the code
you need to solve them. Next one we're
talking about error handling and
resilience. What kind of problem here is
the silent failures swallowing the
errors missing try catch that kind of
problem. Look at this we have seen this
right? We're expecting that JSON string
is something always parsible. What if it
is not? Then there is a try catch but we
are not doing anything with the catch.
we just ignored it, right? And then this
one here we're assuming the request is
always going to be successful. What if
it fails? We are not doing anything
about that. And the last one is about
the performance and efficiency. Here the
code smell are related to the
unnecessary rdering, blocking loops,
maybe DOM manipulations and etc. Here is
a simple code snippet of the smell
problem that multiple loops over the
same array. You have the number. You're
trying to find a even number and then
you have to find the double of them.
What you are doing? You're writing four
lines which could be one line simple
array method based code. It can be made
really really simple. Then the second
one inline function created on every
render. If you are from React you know
how problematic this code could be. Now
you know some of the common code smells
that impacts many different aspects of
your coding. All the seven different
aspects that we have described and given
example for that. But the code smells
are not limited to only this. There are
more. However, many of these if you know
to identify now by yourself while doing
the coding, you'll be seeing these are
like patterns, antiatterns that has been
followed in multiple different places.
So if you know how to break it to clean
this smelly part of code to a clean code
all those antiatterns now will be
rectified to good pattern and evolve as
good pattern across your codebase. With
that now we'll be getting into our code
editor and we're going to take some of
these codes examples. We'll be
refactoring them if not all a lot of
them and rest of it you are going to
find it on my GitHub. The link to the
GitHub repository is also in the
description of this video. You can check
that out.
[Music]
Here I have got my editor open and I
have a folder called code smell to clean
code. Inside that there is a folder
called src and I've created another
folder called session. Inside that there
is a index.js file where I'm going to
put all the code that I'll be mentioning
in this session. You can go ahead and
find it out from the GitHub repo as
well. All right, let me close this out
and get started. The first example, the
first one is the bad indentation and
lack of spacing. We have spoken about
it. I'm not explaining this again. But a
cleaner approach would be proper
indentation and spacing. If you see over
here, there are proper spacing with the
operators everywhere and there are
semicolons. If you're using semicolons
to terminate, if you're not using
semicolon, don't use anywhere. If you're
using it, use it everywhere. Even at the
end of the function if you see over here
it was missing and thus this is much
much cleaner approach than whatever we
had. So the bad indentation and the lack
of spacing is now modified with proper
indentation and proper spacing. That's
the first one. We have seen this smell
isn't it very hard to read if is logged
in and then everything is in the same
line. You have show dashboard update
user activity log analytics everything
in the same line. Very very hard to
read. Now the cleaner approach would be
much more structured and readable where
you have this if block and inside if
block each of these function execution
are in the single line separated by the
new line and there are adequate space.
The first example that we have taken the
indentation and the space is also been
factored in in this example. So from
smell this is the cleaner approach hard
to read from the structured and more
readable. Do you remember this mix
styles coursemail that we spoke about
where we were using two different kind
of functions? One is regular JavaScript
function and there was an arrow
function. And what the suggestion was be
consistent with the modern syntax as
much as possible. So we are using the
arrow function in both the cases. Now
both for greet and by before greet was
with the plain old JavaScript function
by was with the modern arrow function.
Now for both greet and by we are using
the arrow function. Not only that here
we used to get the concatenation using
the plus sign which is not that great.
We know instead of that in JavaScript we
have to use template literal which
almost look like the natural syntax of
writing any concatenation. So we have
replaced that for both greet and by
using the template literal over here. So
from mix styles we have now consistent
modern syntax. I got to mention about
this because this is something I find
very often whenever I do code review
especially with some of the opensource
project that I run inconsistent naming.
So we have taken this example before.
Now I have made it consistent with the
camel case. This is what I generally use
for all my variable namings. So if you
see user name become username with camel
case. Same for user age and for is
logged in as well. It makes things
really consistent throughout the
codebase. I hope you remember this one
right the x and y and I asked what is x
and what is y for. So in this case x
could be width y could be height. Please
be explicit descriptive about your
variable names. Very very important.
Remember this code smell you have a
function called create user where you
used to pass five parameters. That means
if someone is invoking create user from
the caller you have to pass five
arguments the value for each of these
parameter. Now it might grow from 5 to
8. Will you add three more parameters
over here? Instead of that what you
would do you would rather use an object
and you use the dstructuring of object
and use that as a parameter. The
difference over here is in terms of
calling create user over here somebody
has to pass it like this for name
tapascript age example one email learn
at typoscript.io IO address global is
admin true. Now there is a high
possibility that you might miss
something over here while typing. There
is a high possibility that there will be
few more getting added and you have to
again adjust that over here. Instead of
that you can now convert it in such a
way that create user accepts an object
an object like this user where you have
this properties name age email address
is admin everything defined and while
calling the create user you just passing
this user object you see the caller
doesn't have to really pass each of
these parameter because in the
definition of the function itself I'm
now using object dstructuring so I'm
dstructuring name age email address is
admin everything from this user object
and using it inside the function. So
calling of create user in this case
passing five things calling of create
user in this case basically passing just
one thing. There's a huge difference
because this user this object might come
in both the cases from your API call.
Here you are doing extra work here you
are not doing that extra work and you're
keeping the code clean. Now the story of
magic numbers the magic values the
numbers strings etc. Right? We spoke
about this code. We don't know what is
01. We don't know what is 0.1. And if
0.1
all this thing gets changed tomorrow
some value. You have to change it in
multiple places. The clean methodology
is use named constants. So for admin
role you might want to signify with 01.
For a different kind of role you want to
give 02 03 like that. Define each of
them using named constants. In this case
we have done admin role 01 discount for
admin is 0.1. Now this code is much more
cleaner. Not only cleaner tomorrow if
you have to change the discount from 0.1
to 0.3 and if this discount has been
used multiple places for some
computation you don't have to change in
multiple places. You will come here and
you'll change in one place. That's a big
win. So magic values magic string magic
numbers. Make sure you extract them out
and use named constants. Remember this
long function doing many things. Now
we're going to talk about that. So there
is a function called handle order which
is doing lot of things. Now what we have
to do to make it clean, we have to use
something called decomposition.
Decomposition means breaking out. Break
out the relevant logical things together
and make this function much more
simplified. Okay. So first thing is
handle order. Add validate input check
inventory calculate total process
payment send email update analytics.
We're going to break it saying validate
order, process payment and notify user
because validate input, process payment
perfectly makes sense for handle order.
Rest of the things seems to be about
notifying user. So if I go inside notify
user is talk about send email and update
analytics and validate order talks about
validate input and check inventory. So
if you see now validate input, check
inventory has gone inside the validate
order and we call validate order over
here. Process payment is something
staying as it is. Notify user is taking
basically send email and update
analytics. Remaining is a calculate
total. I think we will remain this
calculate total as it is over here.
Yeah. So this is even much more
simplified form because the send email
updating analytics all these kind of
things might be a reusable aspects and
can be used elsewhere. So instead of
duplicating these two lines everywhere
now I can call this function and that
will be my reusability for and also I
have broken the bigger function into
much more smaller function. Remember
this complex loop logic where we were
identifying the active user who are
adult. Now I hinted that we are using
array array of users and this is
JavaScript where there are plenty of
array methods that we get out of the box
from the programming language itself. We
don't have to really make this code
looking so hard using for loop rather we
can use the given methods from array
like filter map etc to make this code
much more expressive and in the
functional language style. So this code
works definitely it works. It gives the
same output but this code looks short,
elegant and more expressive. I hope it
makes sense. Let's look into another
logic smell. So here it is a deeply
nested condition. We have seen that like
if user if user is active if user is
active and user is there then check for
role. If user is there if the user is
active if the role is admin then access
admin panel. We can write the guard
clause and early return instead. We can
check it like if there is no user if the
user is not active or user role is not
admin just return don't process access
admin panel function at all. If that's
not the case go ahead and access. So how
many line from 131 to 137 is now just
these two lines. It is much simpler much
elegant and we have tackled it using the
guard clause and early return. Let me
know if you're already using some of
these styles. Would be great to know
like what you are using so that all of
us can learn together from your comment.
Switch case must handle the unexpected
unknown cases always and that is why you
should not missing out on the default
case. The smell code over here is
missing out on the default case. Admin
and user perfectly taken care. But what
if the role is not admin user? In that
case, what are you going to do? So make
it very clean by always handling the
fallback. In case it is not an admin,
not an user, you are going to handle the
unknown case and return something. This
is much better and there is nothing
unexpected that you're leaving out for
this program to happen or output. Here
is another smell where we are seeing the
first one is relying on primitives.
Primitives value mean string, integer,
boolean, all those things, right? in
JavaScript relying on primitives to
model a complex concept or a complex
data structure. Now this is trying to
model an order and is saying this is a
primitive tapus some string tapus
address some number some number nobody
understand what exactly this data mean
but clean would be instead of doing it
in this way create an object be
descriptive about each of the property
of your data structure. This is the
customer name. This is customer address.
These two I could guess but I could not
guess what is 2 and 299. Now I know okay
two is the number of items that is there
in the order and the total price is 299.
So this is much more descriptive and you
handled it in a proper way. This
particular smell is also known as
primitive obsession. So don't be
obsessed with primitives. Go for a
better degree of data structure that
available in the language. We also spoke
about this mail where the function
mutates an external variable. A very
very bad practice to leave the global
variables like this. Instead of that,
opt for something called pure function.
A function that returns the same output
for the same input. Right? And the side
effect is something that is very much
reduced when you're using pure function.
So read about pure function. Try to opt
for it where you can reduce the global
pollution a lot. Let's talk about few
smell around error handling. my favorite
subject. You know, I spoke at least two
or three times about this particular
smell, not talking again. But now I'm
talking about how to handle it. I'll be
putting this royally inside a try and
catch and inside the catch I'll be
handling it like if it is coming inside
the catch with an error. It means that
the parsing has failed and it is an
invalid JSON. Right? This is how I'll be
handling things. So make sure don't go
blindly relying on that JSON string is
always going to be something that you
can purse. On the same line, you have a
try catch, but it's rarely ignored.
There is nothing inside the catch. It's
always better that you report out that
error, what exactly happened and do
something with it. Maybe you want to log
it somewhere, want to show it to the
user. So do all that inside the catch
block. Don't silently swallow the error
messages. There is one more that you
have an array of numbers and you want to
figure out the even one and then want to
double them. How are you going to do
this? One approach is this. Perfectly
fine. It works. event. What you have
done is you have used the arrays method
over here. Great. To filter out the
event one and then again you are doing a
for each to do the double. Maybe you can
combine them with the using of reduce.
There is one more method in array
practically for this kind of purpose. So
you can write rewrite this one using the
reduce function and this is much much
clean as per me and reduces a lot of
smell because unnecessary declaration of
the variable is not required.
unnecessary explicit for loop is for
each loop is not required all this thing
that you can actually get rid of and
write the code in much more concise way.
So these are some of the refactoring
that I wanted to call out but there are
more that you can find out if you can
come to github.com/tappascript
go to repositories
and find this code mail to clean code
inside this repo you have this src you
know sessions and this index.js JS file
you'll find everything over there. Now
I'm going to talk about two super cool
tools that I rely on. One is called
ESLint. This is something help me to
understand where the problem where the
code smell is there in my code and also
help me to refactor to make the code
clean. And the second one is called
pitifier which is very very helpful in
terms of formatting your code. Okay. Now
how to enable them? How to make use of
them? Let's look into them one by one.
Let's start with pitifier. To use
pitifier, make sure that you come to the
extension. If you're using VS Code, I'm
sure like it will be there for most of
the editors. Search for Pitifier. You
will find this extension over here. Make
sure that you install that extension.
And once you install the extension, it
relies on a particular file called
pitifier RC. So come over here, create a
new file called pitifier RC. This is the
file and this is where you can define
what will be the format structure or the
metadata for your codebase. For example,
what is the tab width once you do the
tab? Whether it's going to take two
spaces, four spaces, whether you are
going to use single quote everywhere,
will there be a trailing comma, you want
to use semicolon, you don't want to use
semicolon, what will be your end of
line. There are plenty of rules that you
can specify for that. You can go to the
website or you can get these rules from
any of the well-known project, put it in
your code and start working. It's pretty
simple. This is very very helpful in
terms of formatting your code. But what
I love even more is the ESLint one.
Let's take a look into that. Now to use
eslint, I need to install certain
configuration. To install certain
configuration, I need to make this
project my project as a nodebased
project. Okay, for that I will do like
npm init and then hyphen y. This is
going to create the package.json file
for me with all the project description.
If I go inside the package.json file, it
doesn't have much. It's very simple
package.json file. But this will allow
to install other dependencies like
eslint. Now to install eslint, the
command that I'll be giving is yarn
space
at eslint/config.
What does it mean? I'm using yarn as my
package manager. So I'm using yan
create. If you use npm, you'll be use
npm specific command. If you use PNPM,
you'll be using PNPM specific command.
Now the documentation of how to use this
command, where to use this command is
there on ESLin site and the link to the
documentation is in the description of
this video. You can find it and choose
the command that suits your environment.
For my case, it is yarn. Let's go ahead
and execute it. Beautiful. So it is
asking me a few things. Where are you
going to use this lint? Okay, mine is a
JavaScript project. So of course,
JavaScript by default. Enter. Now are
you going to use it to check the syntax
and find problem or only for checking
the syntax? Of course I'm going to use
it for checking the syntax and finding
problems. Is your project using
JavaScript modules like import export
you know common JS or none of this? Mine
actually doesn't use anything but let's
go with import export because I might
use it in future. Okay. What framework
your project uses? It doesn't use
anything. No react, no view yet. So none
of this. Does your project uses
TypeScript? No, it's a pure JavaScript
and where your project runs. Okay, it
runs on browser right now. I might be
using this project for lot of DOM
manipulation and all. So, browser would
you like to install them now? Yes, go
ahead and install. What is your package
manager? As I told I'm using yarn. So,
I'll be going ahead with yarn. It is
installing my stuff. Let's stay cool.
And my things have installed. If I go
inside package.json now, I'll be able to
see all these things have got installed.
Beautiful. Now I have created a file
called bad.js
because this is really bad and it is
giving some error already. If I see
mouse over x is assigned a value but
never used this file is full of code
smell. You know there is ID is defined
but never used all these things. But
these errors are not enough actually if
I run eslint now what I have showed you
in the session like a report that eslint
gives. Let's see that. So the command
for that would be let me clear this up.
So the command will be mpxlint
and then the path of the file on which
we want to run this linting rules. So
for me it is bad.js file which is inside
src and the sessions folder. Let's go
ahead and run. It's running. All right.
So it's finding out error x is assigned
a value but is never used. Error ID is
defined but never used. Error unused ver
is assigned never used. So by default it
is shouting for these three. Now the
thing is there are multiple other
configuration files exist. For example
one exist from Airbnb configuration
files from XO. Let's pick up one from
XO. Again this is also there in the
documentation. Okay. So what I have done
yarn create eslin/config.
Last time we did yarn create esconfig
alone. But now we are giving a switch
called config and we want to use esl
config xo. Enter. Let it go and run. So
it's successful again. It is going to
ask whether I want to install. Yes, I'm
going to install them. I'm going to
install using yarn because that's my
package manager. The installation is
done. Look at this. Now the moment
installation is done. Now this file is
fully you know bloody file. Every line
of this file is having smell. This one
unexpected var use late or const
instead. You should not be using v. You
should be using late or const. Okay.
What about this one? users is never
reassigned. Okay, use const because if
you're using let it means that you have
chances that you'll be reassigning a new
value or other value to this variable as
you not doing in this code use let
beautiful it is here missing space so
another smell that it is catching here
of course missing space okay over here
ID it is never used yeah it's never used
this is formatting is completely gone
missing spaces before opening okay here
missing space before opening missing
space before opening unexpect expected
to do command to-do handle other you
know other things here unused is
assigned a value but never used and over
here new line required at the end of the
file that is not maintained so bunch of
things this is also missing semicolon we
have opted for semicolon as a rule so it
is missing now if I go to the command
prompt again here this up and now I will
run this one npx yes lint association
badjs look at this now look at the error
list the same thing that it is you know
showing over here and I'm going every
places and doing a mouse over and
finding out it is listing out everything
all the error all the warning that I
know very very clearly this is where
each of the code smell that you can
capture and you can now fix them how can
you fix them I am going to show a few of
them you can come over here for example
v x equals to 10 here you have something
called quick fix click on quick fix here
you have bunch of fixing options so
these are the refactoring option for
your quotesmail you read which one
actually make lot of sense to you and
you utilize that for this case if the if
it is something like x equals to 10 you
have declared but x you have never used
you might want to just remove this
variable that will be an option then fix
this no problem I'll click on this it
made it as late you see that it fixed
the problem but there is another problem
another problem is x x is assigned a
value but never used let's fix it fix
this prefer const because it is not
reassigned so I prefer a const. Okay, I
still have problem. What is the problem?
X is assigned a value but never used.
Okay, quick fix. I'll remove the unused
variable X. Okay, that's my fix. Still
there is a problem. What is the problem?
There is an extra space. I'll go ahead
and delete this extra space. Can I see
what is the problem? Comment should not
begin with a lower case. So, quick fix
would be make it capitalize. Now, that
problem has gone. You see how beautiful
it is. So, now each line by line you can
go and you can fix the problem. Make
this bad. js file as a good dot js file
and try it out. This is the first task
that you have that you need to do.
Bad.js file is given in the same
repository that I have showed you a
while back. Even the good dojs file is
also given over there. But don't look at
it at the first shot. Do with the bad.js
and then compare it with good.js. I hope
you like this tooling part as well. Make
tool part of your development cycle so
that you really don't have to bother
about lot of code smell that you'll be
introducing otherwise. also the reviews
and everything will be much more better.
Another thing that I want to call out
whenever you are using the tools like
pitifier or the eslint and if you're
working in a team make sure the
configurations for these tools are
similar across. If you are using some
configuration and your other developer
is using a different configuration that
is going to introduce code smell
conflict again for example you opt for
semicolon the other person doesn't opt
for semicolon you opt for double quote
other person other person opt for single
quote so unnecessary in the code review
you will see the diff in the code just
because of single code double code
semicolon no semicolon all these things
right so ensure that the configuration
option if you are using Airbnb
configuration exo configuration
default configuration your own
configuration. For ESLint, it is
normalized across for everyone in the
team. Same thing goes for pertifier as
well. Look into the documentation of
Pitifier and ESLin both. The links are
there in the description. I'm sure that
it will be very very helpful for you.
[Music]
So this will be a recap like some of the
best practices to follow. Of course,
follow consistent naming convention.
These are at least that you need to
follow consistent naming conventions.
Write small focused functions. Don't
make functions really big. Even you can
consider having a rule of what is the
number of line tolerance level you have
for functions and the classes because
after that it will force you to break
the functions into smaller functions.
Break the classes into smaller classes.
Then eliminate all the magic numbers
source of confusions. Create name
constants. We spoke about that. Prefer
clarity versus clever tricks. Tricks are
great. You can impress other people but
that's not so good from the
maintenability perspective prefer
clarity always and this is the point
that including me not many of the
developers like write test at least
start writing somewhere you know they
force you for a cleaner design refactor
regularly no one is going to pay you no
one is going to appreciate for you but
make it part of your coding practice
that you need to refactor regularly you
have to remove the smell regularly not
occasionally not after somebody is
saying you so I I want to know you like
the session so far. Let me know in the
comment. Please share this video. Please
like this one. Will be really awesome.
And if you want to go deeper, I have a
few suggestions for you.
There is a book called Clean Code, a
handbook of agile software craftsmanship
is written by Robert C. Martin and of
course many other mentors. It's an
awesome book. Try to get this book. It's
available online for purchase. You can
take a look into it and it covers a lot
of common sense making sense things for
quotesmail and the clean code. Go to
martinfor.com
and read the articles, read the thought
process over there. I'm sure that you're
going to learn a lot about good
practices in terms of software
development, software engineering and of
course about the code smell clean code.
I have created a cheat sheet and posted
on my website called tapascript.io. You
can come over here, click on books and
here you will find JavaScript clean code
cheat sheet. You can always access this
cheat sheet which is having a bunch of
examples. Some of them I have already
spoken today and you can take a look
into this as well. All the links that I
have spoken for you to further research
and learn is available in the
description of this video. Please take a
look into them.
[Music]
Let's put your learning into practice.
In the same repo coursemail to clean
code you will find something called a
task folder. Inside the task folder
there will be file called do.js. And in
do.js I have provided few task. For
example I asked you to refactor this
code. I asked you to remove smell from
this code. I asked you to make this code
clean. Not only that you will find a
folder called smell inside task with a
file called process order.js. this
particular file process order having
bunch of code smell into it. Once you
start looking into it, I'm not telling
you but once you start looking into it
you will figure out there are bunch of
code smells that we have learned from
this session are there. So your task
would be to remove those code smell. You
can use eslint or you can go for or you
can go by your own observation but at
the end of it your task will be to clean
those and make it a clean code. I have
already provided a version of
processor.js JS inside the clean folder.
If you want to get a hint, you can take
a look into that. So please do that.
Also look into the readmi file of code
to clean code repository. You would find
all the instructions over here how to
use it. That's all my friends. I hope
you found it really really useful. This
was my honest effort to teach you code
smell to clean code. Check my website
tapascript.io for many other resources
and my YouTube channel called
Tapascript. Links are there in the
description of this video. I'm sure I'm
going to come back with many other good
fundamental resources in the coming
days."

>> Have you ever wanted to build a backend
for your website? In this video, we will
learn how to build a basic backend for a
website from its first setup to running
its first request. Hi, I am Shivani, an
18-year-old developer from India. Let's
start. Backend is the brain behind a
website. It handles user data
authentication and talks to databases.
It makes sure the right response goes to
the right request. So basically every
button you click on a website backend
makes it do something.
Core components of backend development.
Okay. So the first one is a programming
language. You will use a programming
language to write your logic in to write
your backend server in. We can use
JavaScript, Python, PHP, Go, C++ and a
lot more. Then we have a database. Okay.
So a database is like a storage box in
which you keep all your data of the
website. We have two kind of databases.
One is SQL, another one is NoSQL. SQL
databases are the more structured ones
in which all your data gets stored in
tables in rows and columns. It's like a
spreadsheet. For example, Postgress SQL,
SQL light. But on the other hand, we
have NoSQL databases. NoSQL databases
are the more flexible ones where you put
your data in documents, in key value
pairs and in graphs. For example,
MongoDB. MongoDB is what we will use in
this video to get a look in back end.
Then we have a runtime environment. A
runtime environment is the underlying
engine which runs your JavaScript code
outside of the browser on your local
machine. So JavaScript is just text. It
won't magically run on your local
machine. So you need something to
execute it to interpret it. And for that
we need a runtime environment. We have a
lot of runtime environments for
JavaScript. We have NodeJS, Dino, Bun
and a lot more. We will use NodeJS in
this video as we are writing our back
end in JavaScript. But if we write our
back end in Python, we will use CPython
interpreter.
Then we have a framework. So what is a
framework? A framework is something that
helps you build your servers faster and
it it is basically just like a toolkit
for you. So you don't have to write all
the back end in from scratch and it
hides all the complex low-level stuff
which you don't need to worry about. For
JavaScript we can use express.js, Python
has Django, Flask, Java has spring boot
and PHP has Laravel. We have a lot more
but these are the basic ones. Then we
can move on to this analogy. So this is
kind of a flowchart which I have made to
understand this flow better. First of
all, you will be using a programming
language like JavaScript in which your
code and instructions will be. Then you
will use a engine that will run your
code which is NodeJS. Then we will use a
framework which will be express.js.
It is basically a pre-built toolkit for
us. So even if you don't use a
framework, we can make a back end. But I
think using a framework is a lot more
better.
Then you will use a database to store
your data. So every kind of data on the
website which needs to be stored or
retrieved at some point of time you need
to store it on a database.
And all of this stuff makes a backend
server. So to handle your APIs like
requests and responses, you need to make
all this together to make a backend
server.
Next, we have how a front end connects
to a back end. So on the left side, we
have a browser or maybe a user who is
making a request. Let's say it's you on
a website who is making a request. your
request goes to an API and take API like
a waiter here. So API is something which
will take your request to the back end.
Then backend will go to the database see
all the stuff uh it will see if you need
something from the database if you want
to retrieve something or if you want to
save something and all this stuff will
happen in the back end and then back end
will send you back a response through
the APIs. So APIs have a very big role
here. They are always in the between of
you and the back end. So APIs do a lot
of work here. And here is a small box
which I have created. So when a client
that is you the user who makes a request
to the server server is the back end
then that is called a request. But when
the server the back end gives something
to the client that is a response.
Okay, let's start writing our back end.
There are two must- have stuff which you
should be having. First is VS Code
because we will be coding in VS Code and
another thing is NodeJS installed in it.
Now let's take a look on how to install
NodeJS on your local machine. For that
we can go to the nodejs.org
website. This is the official website of
NodeJS. From here we can download NodeJS
for our computer. This is the download
button. You can click on it and then you
get redirected to this page. Here you
can select the version of NodeJS you
want to install on your computer. For
that we have the current version which
is the most latest one. Then we have an
LTS one but the current version is not
the most stable one. you can find. So
the LTS1 is the most stable one to
download. So everybody recommends that.
Next is the operating system you are on.
So select the operating system you're
on. I am on Mac so I will select Mac.
These two things remain the same. And
then by this button you have to install
the package. So when you have
successfully installed the package you
can just go on to your VS code and in
the terminal you can write node - v.
When you enter you get to see the
version of NodeJS your computer now has.
If you see a version like this that
means you have successfully installed it
or if you don't see it then it's not
installed.
Now
let's hop on to our sheet and let's see
the next thing which is the folder
structure for the project we will be
making in this video. The back end and
the front end are going to be split up
into two different folders and for the
ease to maintain them. So back end and
front end are going to be different
folders. Nextly let's have a deeper look
into the backend folder. So these are
the files which we will be making in
this video. The front end will be empty
because we are not working on the front
end. We are learning intro to back end
in this video. Now let's start the
project. So we will go to the desktop
make a new folder named
intro to back end. Okay. And then we
will drag this into the VS code app. Now
that I have this folder opened in the VS
code, I can start making my folders. So
the first folder which we will make is
the backend folder which we are going to
work on. Nextly I will make readme
dot MD file because we want to
initialize this repository. So we have
to write something.
Now let's initialize this repository by
this button and let's write a commit
message which can be initial commit
and then we can commit this.
I will make it a public repository.
So it has been pushed to GitHub and now
we can start making other files.
The first file which we need to make is
the package.json file. So what does this
file do? This file is where all the
metadata about your project is kept like
all the libraries, all the dependencies,
basically all these fancy things which
you use for your project are kept here.
All the data about them. So to make this
file you have to go onto your terminal
and then you have to write npm
in it. When you write this and you click
enter you get a set of questions to
answer. So the first question is the
package name. It has written it intro to
back end. I'm okay with it. I will click
enter. Then the version. The version is
one. And then a description. So a
description can be a tutorial
or intro to back end.
Then the entry point is going to be the
index.js file. We will be talking about
how does this entry point is resided and
how does it work in the later of this
video. Test command is something the
test scripts we will write ourselves. So
let's keep it like this for now. The G
repository which we just initialized
comes here. And then keywords if you
want to write any keywords you can. We
will leave it empty for now. Then the
author's name uh my name is Shivani. So
I will write that. Then the license is
ISC. Let's keep it. And then it will ask
you is this okay? And yes we are okay
with it. So I will click enter. Now you
can see we have a file here which is
named as package.json.
You can see it has a name uh version
description all the things which we
wrote and clicked enter to. These are
the scripts which we will be writing and
enhancing over the video.
The repository author name license. Yes,
this is how this files look like. When
you will install any dependency or any
library, their names will come here and
we will see them further in the video.
Once we have set up our backend repo,
the first thing which we will do is to
connect to a database. Our database is
going to be MongoDB Atlas. And to create
that, we can go to the Mongodb
Atlas website.
So this is the website. You go on it.
You can create a account
and I am signing here because I have an
account already.
Okay. So this will look like this. If
when you have made an account here, when
you go on this, you can see we get to
see the projects we have made. I will
click on this button and make a new
project.
Now we have to write the name of our
project. The name of project can be
intro to back end.
This is optional. So we will leave it
empty. Then we click on the next button.
Then you can add members and set
permission. So we don't need to do them.
We will just create the project by
clicking this button.
Okay. Now we can create a cluster. So we
can create create a lot of clusters for
even one project. But we will need only
one cluster for this project. Here you
can see they have different plans. We
will click on the free one. And so we
have a lot of regions here and you have
to select the region which is the
closest to you. So I will select Mumbai.
and then I will create this deployment.
Once you do that, you get this window in
which you can get a username and a
password for your database. So for every
kind of cluster, you will have a
username and a password because nobody
should be able to access your database.
So this is the password to it. When I
click on this button,
I can copy this and then I get this to
create this database user which is me. I
will click on this and then I can choose
a connection method. We have a lot of
connection methods and I will choose
compass. Here when I choose that I get a
connection string. So this is an URI
which we will be writing in our server.
For that I will go to the folder in VS
Code, open it and then we will make a
new file named as env.
But what does this env file do? So we
have to create av file. What does this
file do? This file keeps all your
environment variables basically all the
secrets of your project. So these are
the things which you don't want to push
on your GitHub profile and you don't
want to show people because earlier I
said that you don't need anybody to
access your database. So this is where
we can safely put our things like the
database name, username, passwords and
all those things. For that I will write
here MongoDB
URL.
And you must be wondering what is an
URI. So URI is like the older brother of
URLs. URIs are uniform resource
identifiers. These are just like URLs.
You know what a URL looks like but these
URIs have much much more packed in them.
So basically you have the database name,
you have username, passwords all in this
one string. You can see that here. So
this whole thing is the string which I
will copy from this button [snorts] and
then I can paste it here. You can see
this thing is the database name and here
I have to put the password. Now
here is the database access button. You
can see who are the people who have the
access to our database. So we have one
user which is me and I am the admin
because I created this. So when I click
on this edit button I can see this
window where you can edit the password.
So we have to write a new password.
Let's just write
intro to
backend. I have written intro to
backend. I can show that to you and then
copy it.
Now you have to update the user because
we changed the password and they are
deploying it. So we have to wait for
some seconds. Till then we should be
writing the password. So I will cut this
and paste in the password. Now that I
have pasted it, let's save the file and
let's make let's move on to the another
file which we need to make which is
constants.js.
So this is the file where you will be
keeping all the constants. So becomes
easy for us to use in our server. So
what can be the constants like? Okay,
first of all let's make a source folder
in which we will be keeping all our
files. Then I will make another folder
which will be config. [snorts]
And then in this I will make a new file
named as constants
constants.js
and let's write export. Okay. One thing
we can see here is that
we cannot write ES modules here. So we
have two kind of modules ways in which
we can write this. For that I have to
come here in the package.json file and
write the type in which I'll be writing
all my JavaScript modules which will be
the module type. So we have two types.
One is common JS and the another one is
ESM. So we will be using the ESM one
because they are the new ones and they
are the standard way to write
JavaScript modules these days. I will
save this file and then we can go back
to constant.js
and then write export con DB name
equals to whatever your database name
is. Our database name was intro bracket.
This was our database name. So this file
is not that important but it's a very
good practice to have a file like this
because now you can see that I can just
write DB name anywhere in our server in
our backend code and it will point to
this intro to back end. So I don't have
to write intro to backend everywhere. I
can just write DB name and the server
will know that what DB name is actually.
Now the another file which we need to
make is app dot js. We have to set up
our express app. Express.js is the
framework we are using in this project
and app.js is the file where all your
requests come firstly. So we will
understand this later also. Now let's
make the app dot js file. I will make
this in the source folder app.js.
Now the first thing is that you need to
import the express app in app.t js file.
So import express
from
express. Yes, this is the syntax how we
write it. Now you can see that it's not
coming in the color. It's not it's
coming dull because we have not
installed the express. For that you can
write you can open your terminal and
then write npm install
express. So this is the way you can
install anything. When I enter
this takes a bit of time and then you
can see it has added all the packages
and all. When you go onto your
package.json JSON file. You can see that
we have dependencies and it's saying
express and then the version of express
which we have on our computer. Now
something
called as package log.json
file has also been created. We don't
have to worry about this but you can see
that we have this number here. Why?
Because we got a node modules file also
folder.
And you wouldn't want node modules to
you know push on your GitHub. For that
we need to make another file called agit
ignore file. For that I will make new
file named asit ignore.
Now the dotgit ignore file is a file
which in which you write all the things
which you don't want on GitHub to be
pushed. So as I told you that you don't
want your secrets to be pushed on GitHub
and also you don't want node modules to
be pushed on GitHub. For that we can go
to any browser and write that we want a
ignore generator.
You can get a lot of generators.
I will use this one. Here you have to
write node
and then you will just click on create.
You get a full file here. You can copy
it like this.
Copy and then paste it here. So what did
we just do now? Here you uh I can show
you. Okay. See here we have written node
modules. So now node modules won't be
pushed on GitHub.
Similarly, you can see env.est.p
production. These kind of files are not
going to be pushed on GitHub. I got the
git ignore file out of the source folder
into the backend folder because backend
has node modules and git ignore easily
would be able to ignore node modules.
Now we don't have those 600 things but
only five which need to be pushed on
GitHub. Let's get back to our point
where we were
which was creating the app.js file. So
in app.ts we wrote this and we installed
express but it's still not in color
because we have not used this yet in our
code. So let's write const app. We are
making a app
and it is express parenthesis. Now you
can see that it just got colored because
I used express. So if you don't use
anything, it will always be dull. Then
the last thing which you need to do here
is to export this because we will be
using this app in our another files
also. So you need to export this. Export
default. Okay. This way you [snorts]
export this. Now we have made our app.js
folder. And let's write a comment here.
Create
an express app.
Okay. The next folder which is our
database.js.
So this is a very important file. It
connects your back end to the database.
Now for this we will be making a new
folder in config
new file named as database.js.
Now we have to import some stuff again.
Import mongus from mongus.
So you must be thinking what is mongos?
You need something to talk to MongoDB
because we need something between our
server and the database which will be
talking to the database and mongus is
what does it also mongus lets us define
the structure of the data types which we
will be making in the models in the
later of the video. So for now what you
need to understand is that mongus is
something which talks to the database
and it's important when you are using
MongoDB.
Now open your terminal and again we have
to npm i mongus.
Also one thing that if you want to write
install you can write that but if you
just want to write npmi and the
dependency name it just works similar.
So npmi mongus enter and then you will
see that mongus will get installed onto
your computer. Now I will make a const
and I will write a constant as connect
TB because we are connecting to database
in this folder and I will write async an
arrow function.
Now you must be wondering what is async.
Now async await is something which we
use when we want in JavaScript when you
want some task to finish and then only
the next task should begin. So this is a
very good thing which async and await
does and this ensures that when one task
finishes then only the other task should
begin and it is very important thing
because if we don't use a async await
things will go messy and we won't be
able to handle one task and then
another. So that's why we will use async
aait. Another thing which we will be
using here is try and catch method. So
when you click on this you get this try
and catch is also a very good thing in
JavaScript where you can just write the
process which you want and catch you you
can catch your error. So if the app
crashes you can catch the error
specifically and this is a very good
thing to catch all the errors which are
coming and this is a good practice
because if any error comes you get to
know it. Now let's write a const and
then the connection instance.
We are connecting to the database.
Okay. So I have written a wait here and
mongus will do its thing and we will be
connected to MongoDB and this line here
says that we will be using
the MongoDB y which we just wrote in the
env file. So it will be extracted from
envi file and then for ourselves we will
write a console log. So then in the
console log we can write a sentence for
us which will tell us that yes our
MongoDB has connected we have connected
to the database for that let's write a
console log and I will use baptics
because after the sentence I want the
host to be written so I want the address
of the connection instance also for that
I will use back and then we will write
our line. You can write your own line. I
will write MongoDB uh MongoDB connected.
Yes, let's write this MongoDB connected
and then three exclamatory marks. Then I
will go on to the another line. We will
use a dollar sign and then curly
brackets and then I can just write
connection
instance
dot
connection
dot host. So this line will tell me the
address of the connection instance. We
will see that in the terminal in some
minutes. And then it is completed. Now
the another thing which is very
important that's why we use try and
catch is that I will write a console log
here too which will tell us about the
error if any comes. So I can just write
MongoDB connection failed
and then it is an error. So error also
when you we are using
await that's why I will write process
doexit
and one so this will ensure that when I
when this whole process gets done
this process gets exit and then we move
on to the another task. Lastly, we will
write
uh export because that is important to
use this connect DB constant this
connect DB constant in our other files.
So I will export connect DB. I will save
this file and then we can go onto the
another file which is the last file
which is index.js. js and the most
important file.
So, so far now we have made like these
many files and I can say that if you
want to write this database.js and
app.js all into the index.js file, you
can do that. So, index.js is the file
where you start your server. This is the
file which starts your backend service,
your backend server. So let's make the
file in the source folder a new file
which will be named as index.js.
In this file we will write how our
server is going to start. For that we
will import.
First thing is that we need the stuff
from env file in this folder. So for
that I will import
from env. Now what is enven is a
dependency which again helps us to
extract environment variables. This lets
us use our environment variables in all
our server. So we can again we will
write npm I env. Okay. So it is going to
install. Now I can write env dot config
parentheses curly braces and then we you
write the path. So how will env know
that from which file do you need your
environment variables? For that we can
write dot / env. So you can see that we
have our envend
folder.
So we write it as dot / and then env the
f files name. This is how env is going
to know that what do you want from which
file do you want your env variables
environment variables also here is an
important thing you need to give this
thing here because it tells it to stop
basically
if you don't that's okay but it's a nice
practice
then we have to make another constant
which is going to be start server
basically This whole file is about
starting our server. So I will name it
as start server. Okay. Again I will be
using a sync
and then an arrow function.
Again I will use prian catch. Now I will
write await
and connect db. Now you may remember
that connect db was okay. So I just
clicked on that suggestion you saw and
it got this import line from there. So I
imported connect DB from the config
folder which was database. Here one
thing is missing that I should be
writing database.js
because that is how the server will know
to get the file. And let's continue it
from here. I will add parenthesis
and then the next line. So app is now
going to be on. We are going to switch
on our server.
And then you write error for any errors.
And then again we will use
uh
error function. And then I can just
write a console log because if any error
comes we need a line which tells us that
yes there is an error
and then you just throw error.
So here I missed one thing in this
error. We need to wrap this up in
another parenthesis
and
then a parenthesis here.
Okay. Now another thing is that you have
switched on the app. Now you want the
app to listen. So you write app.list
lesson and then
the process do env.
Now what is the port like app is going
to listen but from which port? The ports
are like you know that your laptop has a
lot of USB ports to input stuff and
similar to that online in the digital
world we also have a lot of ports from
which your application is going to hear.
So your application is only going to use
one port and that port can be specified
in the ENV folder. like I can just come
here in the TNB file and then I can
write port equals to like let's say I
give it 4,000 and then I save this and
then I go on to index.js
and then I write here process.v.p.
So from the env folder we are going to
take out this port from which we are
going to connect from which our server
is going to listen and then as an or
sign we can assign like 8,000. So if by
any reason this port doesn't work or
this port is busy somewhere we will use
by default 8,000 for to you know just
not get errors and easily do make the
app listen. Now we write arrow function
and then again we will write a
console.log on whatever port our app
listens we get to know that. So we can
use back tick. We can write server is
running on port whatever port you're
listening. So we don't know which port
we will be listening. So I can just
write dollar sign and then
the process.
So now we know that this port is going
to come from thev folder from the env
file and it will be written in the
terminal when we will connect to our
database. Now we need to catch our
errors also. So let's write again a log
a console.log
and then we can write mono db connection
fail and then it's an error. So I will
write error. And lastly
here I won't be exporting anything. We
will just write start server parenthesis
and yes
save this file. And now we have
our server will start. No more files to
write for our database. Now one thing
which we need to do is go here and
in the package.json JSON file. The
scripts are what you write on your
terminal to start your server. So
basically I will cut this line and write
a script so that we can use that script
in our terminal as a command to start
our server and see if the database is
connected or not. For that we can write
start and here I can write node source
index.js.
Why did I write source and then index
js? Because we have index.js in the
source folder. And now when I save this
I can go on to the terminal and write
npm rundev.
Okay, it's saying we have a missing
script as dev and yes it's right.
Another script which is important to
write is the dev script. Here I will
write nodemon
same source index.js.
Now
where from where did this nodemon thing
came? Nodemon is something which we can
install from our npm packages npm
i nodemon. Why do we need nodemon? We
need nodemon because if you want to
start your server like let's say you are
the developer and you are developing
some backend project. Now you want to
start your server again and again and
for that you will need some automation
and that automation is nodemon because
if you want to do it manually you have
will have to always click control + c to
terminate your terminal every time to
start the server again and that is
painful. So we use nodemon it's
automated. What it does is that when you
install this and in write it as a dev
script, what happens is that whenever
you save your files, it automatically
starts your server which saves a lot of
time. So let's install this.
And now I will save this file. And now
when you write npm run dev
then we run we can run it nicely but I
think we are getting some errors. It's
saying cannot find module.
Now we can start our server. So I will
go to the terminal. Now we can start our
server. So I will go to the terminal and
then write npm rundev. So npm rundev is
the dev script which we wrote here to
start our server and the start script
also can start our server by writing npm
start but we will go with npm rundev and
then I will click enter. So when I click
enter our server will try connecting to
MongoDB but I see that we got some
error. So let's see it says expected
connection string to start with this or
this. So if I go into my env file, I can
see that our connection string is
starting with this. So it is correct.
That means that we have another error
with this. One thing also I see here is
thatv is not in the root directory and
it needs to be in the env directory. So
I will drag it down to the root
directory.
Now I also see that we made mistakenly
two node modules files which are not
correct. We need only one node modules
folder. So I will delete this one and
I will keep this one in the root
directory as it is. Also whenever you
change files you have to start the
server again. So I will delete this one
and write npm rundev.
So it connected but then it failed and
we have an error named as app is not
defined at start server. Okay. So in the
index.js file we have start server and
it is saying that app.js was not
defined. So app is not defined. So I can
see that I have not imported app. So I
will import app. I can go with this
suggestion. And now we have imported app
because we were using app do.on and then
app do.listen. listen. So we needed to
import it. Now I will save the file and
let's see if it gets connected and yes
MongoDB has connected. The second thing
which we see is here is the address of
the connection instance of our MongoDB
cluster. And the next thing is server is
running at port 4,000. So this is how we
get it that MongoDB has connected
successfully and we can move ahead with
building our server. Now we should be
able to start writing APIs. So we will
write authentication APIs and then basic
grit APIs. So for the initial ones we
will be writing the login, register and
logout APIs which are our authentication
APIs. For that I will be showing you
this
ER diagram. But first of all we need to
understand what APIs are. So APIs are
basically application programming
interfaces. But this is not how you can
understand what APIs are. So we will
build them. They have a structure. So if
you see basic APIs like the
authentication ones, they have routes,
controllers and they have a structure
basically some models also. So the first
thing which we need to learn is what a
model is and this is an ER diagram. But
first of all, let's understand what is a
model. A model is the code version of
the structure of the data you want in
your website. So how you want to
structure every kind of data on your
website is what models are. They define
schemas and schemas are basically
structures. For instance, you can see
this is an ER diagram. What we can see
is that we have users and we have post.
So in our project for this video we have
only two kind of things. One is user
model and another one is the post model.
User model is for the authentication.
So whenever you authenticate on any
website you go and you write your email,
password, username and then you can
register there. So this is for that and
the post one is for the characters you
can post on the website which we are
going to make like you can post
characters which will have a name a
description age and this created and
updated at will be written in the models
we will write them. So yes, this is
basically the ER diagram. What it
basically shows is that what kind of
data exists in our system and another
thing is how they relate to each other.
So we have only two kind of data in our
back end which is the users and the
posts. So now we can start building our
models.
For that we will come back to the VS
code and then make a new folder in the
source folder named as models.
Now in this models folder we can make a
new file named as user dot model.js.
You can name it as user.js JS also but
so that we can if we write it like this
we can easily find it out that this is
the model for users. Now let's start
writing the code for this. We will start
with mongos because mongos is what will
talk to MongoDB for us. So let's import
mongos. Import
mongus. This has a different syntax.
When you write
models, schema is structure. So don't
get confused on it. Schema means
structure
from modules.
Now let's start making our
user schema, user structure which we are
making here.
Now the thing which I showed you which
was the EI diagram which we will use
that only to write this model file. What
are models? Models are the code versions
of the structure of your data which I
told earlier. So this is only going to
be the code version. So we can hop onto
those diagrams and get the code in this
file from there. Let's see how we do
that. Now let's say first thing was
username. You can see username is here.
So I'm starting with username. I will
write it as like this and then curly
braces. Now the first thing is what kind
of type it is. Type is written here
which is string. So
we can just write string here.
Next thing is that is it required like
is it a very required field or we can
not write it if it is optional or not?
No, it's not optional. Username is very
important. So we keep it as true. Then
the next thing is should it be unique?
Yes, it should be unique. So we will
write true also here. Then it should be
lower case also.
So we will again write true here. And
then you can literally write a lot of
things whichever you want for your
username
also we can write trim. So trim is used
for
the white spaces. So let's say I will
write a comment here. Let's say you are
writing your username. Okay. You write
your username as Lily and then you give
some white space and then you enter. So
what happens is white space means that
if I give space here so this space is
called as white space and these white
spaces gets trimmed when you make this
trim as true.
Now the next thing which can be is min
length. This is very important because
you wouldn't be wanting somebody to
write a 100 character username in your
website. So you would want it as like
let's keep it to 10
and okay let's keep it to one only
because it's minimum length. Next is max
length. Okay, max length is something we
can write from our own choices. We can
keep it as 30 as of now. And then let's
hop on to the another thing which is
email or password anything. Let's write
for password now. Password again curly
braces. Then the type
type is string. So we will write string.
Then is it required? Yes, it is
required. So we will write room.
And then we will write min length as
six. Yes, we can write it six or we can
write it 8.
Then max length can be a lot but I'll
just keep it at 50 as of now. Now let's
write email
and again curly braces then it's type
type is string again then I think we
have these things again here so we can
just copy and paste it like it is
required yes it should be unique email
should be unique it should be lower case
it should get trimmed and yes so we can
copy this much from here and then write
it as it is here.
Okay. Another thing is that you can have
a match like for emails you just cannot
go like this because emails should be in
the email format. For that you can add
some stuff here but for now we will just
leave it empty.
Okay.
Now another thing which you might be
seeing is that this created at. So this
is the date time when the user was
created. Now to get this we will write
another
another one here which will be
timestamps.
If you write it as true you will always
get timestamps of every user when the
user was created. So it's a really good
thing.
And the last thing which we should you
do is to export.
We should be always exporting stuff
always exporting the constant which we
take so that we can use it in another
files. So we made a con user. So let's
write it. And then this is the
syntax for this.
So
user schema.
So what is happening here is that mongus
is talking to MongoDB and then from the
model your user is being extracted. So
we can use it in all our servers just by
writing this user. So this user is the
user model. This user is not every
normal user but this is the user model
because you can see it has a big U here
which means it is the user model. Okay.
Now that we have written the model we
can hop on to another sides of our APIs
which is routes.
Okay. What are routes? Routes are the
addresses. It's like an address book. So
whenever somebody requests on something
on your website that request needs a
path to go on. For example, if I go to
any website like y combinator
if I go onto this website
I see a lot of stuff here. If I click on
let's say library.
So when I click on library I have chosen
that route. When I click on this
URL, you can see it has library here by
combinator.com and then / library
because I am on that library route. If I
go on to companies, let's say
then you can see the route changed and
it says company now. So whenever I
clicked on this library or this company
I requested this route that's why this
route came.
Now let's write routes for our register
model. Okay. So this was our
authentication model. This was our user
model. And now I want the users to
register on my website. For that I'll be
writing a new folder in the source
folder named as routes.
Now in this routes I will make a new
file named as
user.oute.js.
So this is the particular file for the
users. Now again let's start with
importing stuff. We will import router
here. Router is a tool which helps us
get roots in express. So let's write
express here. Express is our framework
which basically handles the roots but
router is the tool which we need to use.
Another thing is that we will make a
constant which will be router
and then equals to router
and then you export it. So export
default route. This is it for the routes
folder. Now let's make a controller.
Now we will make a controller. Let's go
into the source folder. Make a new
folder named as controllers. Now in this
controllers folder I will make a new
file named as
user dot controller.js.
Now roots was where you handled the
paths. So whenever a request came it
came to routes and routes take it to the
path where it needs to go to the
specific path to the specific route
which the request needs to go on. The
next step is where controllers come in.
Controllers are the things which really
decide what kind of response has to be
go on to the request. So basically they
are the decision makers. They handle
what routes has come to them.
Controllers are the decision makers.
They handle the requests basically. Now
let's write the controller for our
register model. We need to register a
user. So for that we are going to write
a controller named as
register user.
For this we will import user first of
all because we are doing everything for
users here. So we will import the user
model. Here you can see I am using this
capital U user because this is the user
model
from
user domodel
dot js. You can see that I am importing
the user model from models folder and
the users domodel.js file. Now let's
make a constant named as register user.
You can make a constant named as
anything but whatever the constant does
that name is the best we can keep for
it. Again I will use a sync aait here.
Async aait is nothing but something
which finishes one task and then
proceeds to another. It doesn't mess up
things. Also here I'm going to use this
and then
an arrow function. Now why did I write
request and response here? Because the
first task is to see the request and the
another one is the response. So this is
how it is the flow. Again we will use
try and catch method. As I told you, try
and catch is the best method we can use
to catch errors when any errors come to
our application.
Now we make a constant.
This constant is going to have username.
Our constant is going to have username,
email and password. These are the three
things it will ask for from the user.
and then we keep it in the request do
body because our request will contain
all these things. Okay. Then there are
some steps. There are basically a lot of
steps if you want in when you want to
register a user. I will have some basic
steps like
a basic validation. So
a basic validation for what? So
basically if when I'm asking the user to
type their username, email and password
and they don't type any of them then I
won't be registering them. So for that I
need a if statement which will check if
they wrote everything which we want in
our request body or not. Like if there
is no username
or if there is no
email
then
password then we will give an error
which will be return dot response. we
will give a response which will be uh
straight
400
because it is it's not an error but
basically it's like a response where we
give where we tell the user that all the
fields are required like we can write it
as message and then
write all
fields
are important. We can give a response
like this if none of them or maybe even
one of them is not being given by the
user. The next validation or something
like a check we can do is if the user
already exist in our system. If the user
already exists in our system, we cannot
register them again and again. We won't
be doing that. So for that we will check
if the user
exists
already.
For this we can just make another
constant name as existing and then
a wait write a wait here and then from
the user model we will get we will find
this user if there is someone named
exactly same to this one. You can find
the user by email or by the username. I
will be finding the user by the email.
So let's write email dot to lower case.
We want actually every email is going to
be in lower case but still we are
writing it like this. So that
every email
we find we are finding are in lower
case.
Now that when we find it after it I will
just write an if statement saying
existing.
If the user is existing I will return a
response
with a status code which is going to be
400. And now you just write a message
here like our message is going to be
user
already
exists.
Okay. Now we have done all our
validations two of them. Now we can
create a user. Now let's assume that the
user gave us all the three things
username, email, password and they do
not exist already. So now we need to
create the user and for that we will
make a const named as user. And now this
time you can see that I'm not writing a
a capital letter U but a small U because
the small U names one user but the
capital U means the whole user model. So
we need to understand the difference
between them and then I will write await
for the tasks to finish and then user
dot create. Now the model user is going
to create
our user. Now in this we will just write
all the things which are given to us
like username and basically these things
are going to be saved like this only and
you will see them in postman when we
will test our APIs.
So email will be in lower case.
If it is not then it will be converted
into lower case.
Password
and then
one thing more which is if they are
logged in. No they are not. So I will
just false this one.
Now the another thing is that we need to
catch the error. So we will catch the
error by this.
Now whenever an error comes like we need
to give status codes again we will
always get get different status codes
whatever type of the error is according
to that.
So if there is an internal server error.
So basically nothing is wrong on the
user side but on our server we have some
internal server error. So for that those
kind of errors we'll be writing
here a message which will be uh internal
server error and then it's an error. So
we can write this is an error message
also we forgot to write the response for
when we create a user successfully. So I
will write here west dot status and the
status code is going to be 2011 because
we have successfully created a user and
then we write JSON and then we write a
message which will say that yes user
registered successfully.
So
I can just write here user registered
and then I want the ID of the user in my
response also. So I will write user and
then their id. So I want to extract the
ID the unique ID given by MongoDB of the
user document and then I want their
email also. So I will write email
user dot email
and then the username also. So I will
write username and then user dot
username
and that's it. So these are the things
like the user ID, the user email, the
username are going to come in the
response when we create a user
successfully.
And the last thing is that we need to
export the constants we made here. So as
we made register user here to use it in
another files I need to export it from
this. So I will write register user and
then save it.
Now we can check first of all let's just
check that if our MongoDB database is
connected or not. So I will write npm
rundev
and I can see that yes it's connected.
So that's a good thing. Now the next
thing which we should be doing is that I
will tell you about this how a request
flows through an app. So this is
basically the journey of a request which
we just did. So whenever a request comes
on your website your backend takes it.
App.js JS is the first file which
receives the request. One thing is that
we need to write here is we need routes
to be imported here. So I will write it
as import from
routes
and then user dot route dot js. And the
next thing which we will do is to
declare the routes. So this will be
doubts declaration.
It will also look like app dot use. So
basically we are using the application
now which we made the express
application. And then we can just write
uh like API
version one and users.
So you must be thinking why did I write
API here and version one. You may not
write this but for the basics I'll just
write this is the API this is the
version one and its users. So whenever
we
write this we have to write the name
also. So this is the user router which
we are writing for. And yes so this was
important.
Now what happens is another thing which
I want to tell you guys what is going to
be the example
route. So basically the route I showed
you on the Y combinator website was
something like an URL. So what is going
to be our URL? Let's write that also. It
is going to be on local host because we
are developing on our local machine and
our port was 4,000 which you guys may
remember API
v1
and then
users and then register. So this is
going to be our
URL for now. Also we have to parse the
JSON requests we get from the users on
our website. So for that we need to
write app dot use and then express
dot JSON.
So what does this thing even do? Now
this express.json is something which
gives the ability to our server to parse
the JSON request it gets from the client
side. Now we were talking about the
journey of a request. Now from app.tjs
we receive the request. Every request
which comes to your backend server
always goes on the app.js file and then
it sends all the request to the routes
files. Routes files checks the address
the URL path and method. Method can be
get post which we will be talking about
further in the video. And then routes
when they handle all the parts and they
send all the request to the specific
controllers for them. Then we get to the
controllers and they does the task like
fetching, saving or deleting whatever
the user wants to do from the request
that happens from the controllers. Now
let's take a look on this flow in VS
code. So when I go to VS code we can see
the first file which where we get the
request is app.js.
So we go on to app.t js. We have written
everything but let me just show you the
flow which is here you import your
routes
like you have imported this file which
is the user.oute.js
and then you have used this. So here we
have this users path. This users path
which is going to have all the routes
for the user model. So whatever you are
writing in this controller file this
user.controller file all of them will be
under this one users root or user's
path. Now the next file is routes. Okay.
So in user.routs routes we have to
import
register user register user from our
controller file. So I will click on this
and we will get this line and then we
have to write outer dot post and then
parenthesis
slash now here is you here you write the
constant name so in the user.controller
js file we have this register user
constant. So I am going to write that
here but not that exactly the path we
want it to be. So I can write the name
here which I want to keep for this
particular path which is register and
then dotpost. Why am I writing post here
and here? Because post is the HTTP
method we'll be using here. I will tell
you about these methods soon.
And here you write register user. Now
this route file is completed because I
have written the route here. So what
happens is that when a request has come
into app.js, JS it will go into the
users path and then it will be directed
to this register path inside the users
and after that we will have the
controller who will send the response to
the request and we have written
everything here also.
Okay. Now let's
save the routes file and then
first of all let's see if our MongoDB is
connected.
We have some error which is cannot find
module user.controller.
Okay. So this is a wrong thing because
here it should be user.controller.js js
imported from user.troud.js.
Okay, in this in this file
user.trout.js,
you can see here I have not written JS.
So this was the mistake. Let's see if it
worked. Okay, now we have another error
named as cannot find module and then
user.modjs
imported from user.controllerjs.
controller js. Okay, let's see here. It
is saying that it cannot find the module
users domodel.js.
So let's see what's wrong here users
domodel.js.
It cannot find this file. So in models
we have user and I have written here
users. So this is wrong. So let's put
the s and now we can see. Okay, now we
have another error. Here it is saying
that type error it has a type error
argument handle handler is required.
It means that in the route file says
that as post. So here is some mistake
and I can see it. Okay. So here we don't
have to write post but we have to write
dot route. And first of all what is this
router? So router is the express router
object. As I told you guys, it helps us
define route separately. So we will have
different routes for post model and then
different routes for our users. And then
we have dot route which is the more
specific one which goes into these. So
if I have the user one, the user one is
going to have a lot of routes like
register, login and logout. So for
register one I am writing dot route
which specifies it and then the next
thing is the name of it which is
/register and then I have dot post which
is the http method for this particular
route and then the name of this route in
our controller.
Now let's see yes so when I saved this I
got that MongoDB has connected. Now
let's talk about HTTP. So you must have
seen that on browser whenever you visit
a page you always see that we have these
URLs which start with with HTTPS. So
what is it? It's hypertext transfer
protocol. So basically it's how
computers talk over the web. So
basically it's the thing between the
client and the server. It's between you
and the server which is on the web. It
is used by browsers, Postman, curl, etc.
to request and send data. And the other
thing which we will see here is that how
a URL is formed. The first thing which
we see is the protocol. So protocol
means how it's going to talk to the user
and how the talk is going to be
delivered between the server and the
client. Also here you can see that this
is HTTPS
and not just HTTP. The S here stands for
security. So you will always see that we
are almost always using HTTPS because
it's more secure. The next thing which
is the domain. So if I go on to this
website's URL, you can see that after
https we get excaled.com which is the
domain.
>> [snorts]
>> The next thing which is the most
important thing is the path. So whenever
you are visiting a website you see that
I just showed you on the Y cominator
website that whenever I clicked on
library or resources on any button the
path changed because my request changed
and those request had to go to specific
roots where they would be handled by the
controllers. So you can see that it has
API and then users. So it may be one
from authentication.
Okay. Now we have HTTP methods. What are
HTTP methods? These are the methods in
which your request go. So these are like
tags. On every request you send to the
server, it has a tag or say it has a
HTTP method. So if it has a get tag that
means that you want to get some data.
Get can be that when you open a social
media website let's say Twitter you want
to get a set of tweets on your screen on
your feed so at that time your request
is in the get http method but when you
want to post something when you want to
create data on a website you want to
post a post so at that time you use this
post also when you are registering as a
user you are creating data on at website
because you are registering as a user.
Also when you log in when you log out
all those request go into post because
you change some data or you create a
data on the website. Now we have put
which means you want to update the whole
thing like let's say you are you want to
replace your user's profile so you do
that. If you want to update a part of
your profile on a website, you use patch
and the delete one is to delete data. We
will see this in the postman app after
this.
Now the another thing which we can talk
about is HTTP status codes. So the HTTP
status codes we have a lot of them and
you can see the table is a bit big but
you don't have to memorize every and
each of them. We have some mains like
200 which means that yes your request
was successful. 2011 means that yes you
created some data. So if you logged in
if you registered as a user you created
some data and you will get 2011 or 201.
The another thing is 400 which means a
bad request that says a wrong request or
maybe you gave some invalid input. So
they were asking for a username but you
gave an email on their input field. So
in these kind of things you will get the
400 that means wrong request. You must
have seen 4004 which is the most famous
status code of all times and we all know
it which means not found. So if you have
requested for some data and it doesn't
exist so you will see 404 that means
nothing here at that address. The last
one can be 500 which we talked about
earlier in the video which was internal
server error where your server messed
up. So it's not the user's fault here.
It's the server's fault server messed
up. Now let's hop on to Postman to test
our APIs.
So I will open this Postman app in my
laptop. You guys can go onto the browser
and then you can access it there also.
So from this button I will create a new
workspace and this will be a blank
workspace. So we will just click on
next. After that you have to name it. I
will name it as intro to backend.
and then I will just create it.
So this is the kind of window you'll be
getting after you create a workspace in
Postman.
But first of all we need to know what
Postman actually is. So Postman is an
application for API development and API
testing for which we are going to use
it. We will create a collection here.
And you will get this window. Here we
have to name this collection. I will
name this connection as O because we are
making O APIs like register, login and
sign out. Oh sorry log log out. So for
those I will write it as O. And then I
will click on this plus button to make
requests. Now you can see that we have a
request window where you have you can
see we have a lot of HTTP methods and we
can here enter the URL. So first of all
just name it. We will name it as
register because this is our register
API. And then I will go on to VS code
and I will go on to app.js. Here is the
example root or the URL I wrote down
here. So I will just copy it and then
paste it over here.
So let's dissect this part. Here is the
http which is the method.
Uh also here we need to select this post
method because we are generating data on
the website. We are creating data on the
website. So that's why we are going to
use the post method. After that our
server is running on localhost 4,000.
This is how Postman is going to talk to
our server and get the code. Then API v1
users. Now this part this part this part
I have written in app.js. You can see
here roots declaration. In roots
declaration I have written this for the
whole user model. So whenever I will be
using this this will mean that my
request is going to this users model or
coming from it and then after it you can
see I have this register word here
which means from the root register it is
going to go onto the path of register
and then the controller will handle
register request.
Now
there is something called as headers.
Headers can be a lot of things but the
one we are using here is the content
type. So the content type is going to be
JSON. The next thing is the body. So the
request do body which is taken from the
user. So when a user is trying to
register on your website, they want to
give some data like username, email and
password which we wrote in our
controller. For that we have a lot of
options here like form data and raw
binary graphql.
You have to select this raw and that too
in JSON. So I will select JSON and then
I will write the data here. Let's assume
that I am the user and I have come to
your website and I want to register. Now
I am asked my username. So I will write
that. I can write Shivani here and then
this will also come
like this and then a comma. Another
thing is the email
and then again the email can be shani at
thegmail.com.
After that the third thing is the
password.
I will just write it as 1 2 3 4 5 6.
Okay. Now that I have saved it, then I
will click on send. And when you send
it, you get a 2011 created. So I send it
to my server. And it got me this. This
says that the message is user
registered. User has an ID which is a
unique ID given by MongoDB. Then the
email and then the username. Also you
can see this is the status code which
says a new resource was created
successfully.
So this is how you get a response on
Postman without even needing a front end
to check how your back end is working
and that's why Postman is a great tool.
Now the next thing which is
to show you guys how this has gone into
our database. For that I will take you
to MongoDB.
When you go onto your own project that
is intro to back end which I made, you
can see we have a button here named as
browse collections. You click on this
and you get to a window where all your
data is actually located. So now we are
going to see how data is actually
written on MongoDB Atlas in documents.
Now you can see here is a sample of what
MongoDB gives us to look onto but we
will be testing. We will click on this
and then users.
So you can see it's loading the
documents and we have one document here.
This document has an ID. So every
document also has its own ID and then
the username which was Shivani the
password and the email and created at
time and updated at time and the this
underscore_v is the version which is
zero of course of this document. Now you
can see that this is how data actually
gets stored on MongoDB atlas.
Now the next API which we want to make
is the login API. So your user has
registered but if they want to come back
to your website they need to login and
for that we are going to make another
API named as login. For that first of
all you won't be making any new model
for this because the user model is going
to have all these APIs where the user
registers where the user login or log
out. So these are the things where you
don't need another models. We can just
use this model only for this. Now I will
go to the user.controller.js
and here I will make a new function
named as const login
user. Same we will use async then
request response
and then
an arrow function and then try and
catch.
Now the first validation which we need
to do is that if the user already
exists. So I will write it as checking
if the user
already exists.
For this I will make a new constant
and then parenthesis sorry curly
brackets.
We need two things to login. So when you
want a user to login on your website you
want them to give some data because you
just cannot let anybody login onto your
website. So they need to give the email
and the password.
You can have the username also here to
let them put but I will just have email
and password here and then
I will just keep it as the request body
because this is the body of the request
we want. Now I will write const user. We
will take a constant named as user and
then a wait and then the the user model
which has a letter capital letter U on
it to find the user because we want to
find if that user already exist or not.
If it if they don't exist then we just
have to give an error message that hey
you don't exist on our website or on our
system. Also uh user dotfind one is used
to actually find from the user model or
anything and the dot here means that you
want to extract that thing from user.
Now in this I can just write email
because I want to find the user from
their email. Also this two lower case
means that I want the email to be in
lower case and then parenthesis
and here we can write a semicolon.
Okay, the next thing is what if the user
doesn't exist?
If the user doesn't exist then for that
I can write this and then we can just
return a response which will have a
status which will have a status 400
because
we couldn't find the user
we can write here 4004 also that's your
call I am writing 400 here and then
the message the message you want to give
to the user
which is user not found because we
couldn't find the user on our system.
The next thing is a semicolon here and
now we are done if the user already
exist. If they do then we go on to the
next level and if they don't then we
just give them a response which will be
an error response because we couldn't
find the user. The next thing which we
want to validate is to compare the
passwords. So now let's assume that a
user came on your website and they want
to login but their password was
incorrect. So you must have seen that
when you don't write your password
correct you cannot login. Why? Because
the server was checking it's checking if
your current password matches the
password you're writing. So for that we
need to do that kind of thing here also.
We need to compare both the passwords
and for that I will go to the user
model. Now I could have written this
whole thing in the controller also but I
want to make a universal thing in the
user model only so that I can use it and
it can work for all the functions in our
user model controller. For that we have
a dependency named as brypt. So what
does brypt actually do? Brypt is like it
can hash your passwords. It can compare
your passwords and it's a really good
thing. So we need to import it. But
we need to install it also. So first of
all I will just write this quick and
then we can hop onto our terminal. I can
terminate this and then write npn I
brypt. when I enter I get that this has
installed
and I have written the import statement
here also. Now I will just write how we
can use brypt. Okay. So I will just
write a comment here before saving
any password
we need to hash it. So you must have
seen in the MongoDB that the password is
visible. Now this is not a very good
practice. This is actually not a good
practice at all because what if your
database leaks
and if your database leaks then the
illegal person whoever took your
database can see that all the passwords
are not hashed and they can easily open
anybody's account and login onto your
website which is a bad thing. So we need
to hash it. when we hash it, nobody can
ever find the real passwords. For that,
I will just write here user schema that
means the user
structure and then pre. Now pre means
that I am going to save the passwords
but before saving them I have to hash
them. So for that before thing we need
to use prehair and then async
function because it's in function and
then next.
Okay. And then you just write next
because we need to move on to the next
task after hashing the password and then
parenthesis.
Then there is one catch here. So what
happens is whenever you are going to
save a password
when registering a user the thing is
that you don't have to hash it every
time the user logs into your website or
registers for that I will write an if
statement which will be this dot
modified
this dot is modified let's write it as
like that.
So what means by modified is if your
password is not modified. This
statements means that if your password
is not modified, it is not going to hash
again. If it gets modified, if it gets
updated, then we will hash it. So I will
write the password here, the password
word, which means that if the password
was not modified, it is not going to be
hashed again and again. Then I will
return next again parenthesis semicolon
and then I will write the normal
statement which means the this dot
password equals to await.
And now if this if statement comes true
then the password is of course not going
to be hashed. But if this statement this
40 number statement if your password was
actually modified then your password is
going to be hashed by brypt. So await
brypt doash because we going to hash
from decrypt here and then I will write
this dot password
and now is interesting thing I wrote 10
here. Why did I write 10 here? Because
you see we have salt rounds like
whenever you're hashing any text or any
number you can
set the salt rounds it needs to be
hashed in. I have set it to 10. So 10
salt rounds will be there to hash the
password. You can increase it or
decrease it but I guess 10 is enough and
it's great. The final next so that the
other tasks resume after this. Okay. So
I got this wrong here. I guess here is
the parenthesis which will come. Yes.
Now it's good to go. Now the next thing
was that we wanted to compare our
passwords. So to compare our passwords,
compare passwords. Now I will use again
user schema.
And then this time we are going to use
methods because we are going to compare
our password
and then equals to again async
function
password and then parentheses
then again return.
So now this is a method where you don't
need to write any if statement because
there is nothing to do like that. You
just want to compare the passwords and
then we are going to just return await
and I will let brypt compare the
passwords.
Okay. So now this is done. I will save
this file and then we can go back to our
user controller.
Now we were here. So I will write
compare passwords.
Now you must be thinking why am I
writing here also and then in that file
also about comparing passwords.
what we wrote in the user model was like
uh base. So from there I am just going
to extract that thing here so that we
can use it in logging function. So I
will write constant is match. So I'm
going to match both the password. So I'm
writing it as is match. We can write
anything here. Then I will await the
user compare
password
and then parenthesis. Again we are doing
this with the password. So that and then
here also you are going to use a if
statement of course because if it
doesn't match then you want to tell the
user that hey your passwords didn't
match so we cannot login you. So if the
password was not in match not a match
then you just write return and then you
write a response which is going to be
400 because
they gave invalid credentials.
So we will write a message here as
invalid
credentials. Okay. After this,
what if the passwords match and your if
statement if it did not come true and
the passwords really matched then you
need to give uh another response which
will be 200 because the passwords were
correct and you have successfully logged
in. So for that we can write a message
here user logged in.
After this we can write user because we
want some data of the user like their ID
and their email. So I will write it as
dot
id and then their email.
and also their username.
We want all these data when we get the
response.
And then we have catch. So here I'm just
going to write a response dot status
which will have 500
that must go for
our internal server error
message as
internal
server error. Okay, let's save this
file. Then the next thing is that you
need to export login user. Then let's go
to our roots file user roots and then we
will I will paste it and then name it as
login and http method is going to be
same as post because again we are
creating some data on the website. We
are logging in and I will name it as
login user. And you can see it
automatically came here. But if it
doesn't then you can just write it. So
we imported login user from the user
controller file and then we make a route
here for it. And I guess we have not
left anything. This should work. Let's
first see if our MongoDB is connected.
I will do npm rundev. And we have some
error. Okay. So it says the request
module user controllerjs does not
provide export for
this but I just wrote an export like
here. Let's save the file I guess. Yeah.
So after saving it connected. So always
remind yourself to save the files. So we
are successfully connected. I guess we
are good to go to go to Postman and
check if this API is working. So let's
go to Postman and then make a new
request.
We will name it as login.
Then the HTTP method is going to be
post. The URL I can copy this URL from
here and just put the URL here. We will
just change this into login because this
is the login one. We are still in the
users model. So that's it. Then the
headers will be the same. The content
type is going to be application / DSON.
The body okay so the actually what body
are you asking is email and password
from the user. So you want to draw you
have selected JSON then you have to
write the email which was shani at the
rategmail.com
and
then the other thing was the password.
So let's write the password. The
password was 1 2 3 4 5 6. I save this by
this save button. Now let's click on the
button send.
And then we see that our user got logged
in. Here is the ID and email and the
username. So this is how our login API
will work. Also one thing when we log in
a user that means that we are giving
that user a access token and a refresh
token that means we are creating a
session for them for how long they need
to be logged in on our website. So it
can be like 1 day or 15 minutes or half
an hour. It can be any time you set. So
if you set like 15 minutes after 15
minutes they will get logged out by
itself. So they will have to login
again. So this is where you create
tokens and you do that through JSON web
tokens but we did not do that in this
video. The next thing is that we need to
make another API which is going to be
the logout API. So if the user really
wants to log out from your system by
themselves they want to hit this API.
For that we will make another constant
named as logout user. Then again we will
use async
and then an arrow function
curly braces and then we will start
writing a try and catch. And now we will
start writing the request body which we
want from the user. For log out one you
don't need a lot of things from the
user. You can only get their email and
log out. So this is going to be our
request do body for this logout part.
And the next thing which we will write
is again the constant user await and
then we need to find the user because if
we cannot find the user how will we log
him or her out. So for that I will write
find one and then we will do this by
their email. So the email they provide
us will be the email from which we can
find that user. I will just write email
here and a semicolon and again if we
cannot find the user for that I am going
to use an if statement which will be if
we couldn't find the user then we will
give a message uh basically a response
which will tell the user that hey we
couldn't find your ID or user not found.
So for that we will give a status which
will be 404 404 and do JSON then the
message which will be
user not found
then a semicolon here after this if we
can find the user then that's a really
good thing we will give a status as 200
because it was okay it was clear then
dot JSON and then a clear return
response message that log out
successfully
and then we will
write a error which will be 500 for
internal server errors.
So
the message will be
internal
server error
and it's an error. So I will write error
here. So we are done with this API also.
Here a semicolon will come and then save
this file. Now we need to export this
constant also. Write logout user here.
And then the route file I will go and
paste this line
and write log out here. And this is also
going to be a post because we are again
creating some data on the website
because we are logging out from there.
So the website will be terminating the
session they gave us at the time of
login. Now here I will write
log out user
and then save it. Also when you save it
here you can see that we have got logout
user by itself and yes I think we are
good to go to check it on postman. So I
will go on to postman and then we'll
make a new request named as logout.
Then it is going to be a post method. I
will copy the URL from here
and I will name it as log out. After
that we will give the headers which are
going to be the content type that is
application/json
and in the body we are going to choose
raw which will be in JSON and then we
will give the email which is
shivanithegmail.com.
So we have logged in here and now I'm
going to log out from the same email. So
let's save it and then send.
You can see that we got in 200 okay here
which says that logout was successful.
And this is how our authentication APIs
are made. So this was the most basic way
of making these authentication APIs. Now
I will just commit on GitHub. So I will
save all the files and write a message
named as feature
add
APIs
which were register
login
and log out. Okay. So we can commit now.
Now that we have made the authentication
APIs, we can move on to make our CRUD
APIs. C R U D CRUD APIs. We will make a
new model file for posts.
We which we will name as post
post dot model.js.
Now one thing is that we need to go onto
this diagram where we made the users and
the post models. So we are going to look
at this table or this diagram and then
we will make the post model file. Okay,
let's import first of all mongus because
mongus is what we will use to talk to
MongoDB and create our schemas which are
also known as structures. Then this is
the syntax for this. We write schema and
that from mongus.
After this we will make a normal
constant post schema
equals to a new schema parenthesis
and then curly brackets. One more thing
which I want to tell here is that after
these curly brackets we can make another
curly brackets which will have
timestamps and which will be true
because we want the created at and
updated at dates here. So this is how
the whole thing looks like and the last
line is where you export things. So
export con post
equals to
mongus dot model because this is the
model which we are talking about here
and then parenthesis post and then
post schema.
This is how a model file looks like
exactly. Now in this part we fill all
the parts from this diagram such as
name, description and age. One more
thing that we are not going to have a
lot of input fields for our character
posts. We will only have name,
description and age to understand CRUD
APIs for now. So the first thing is the
name. So I will write it as name and
then type which will be string as
written in the diagram. name is in
string then a comma then another thing
is if it is required and yes it is
required because without a name how can
you post a character the another thing
is that we will use trim here so we are
using trim to cut all the white spaces
anybody could write in the name of the
character so I will write true here and
then we will hop on to the next thing
which is the description so we will have
one on one liner descriptions for every
character on our website. So this is how
we will write description. Description
is also a string because it will be
normal sentences. So it will be the type
string then a comma then required. Yes,
it is required
then a comma and again we can write trim
here because we don't want any unwanted
white spaces. So I will write true here.
Then we have the last thing which is
age. So we can write age here also. For
age.
Age is not going to be a string because
age is going to be an integer which we
can see here. So for that we are writing
type and then you can write integer here
also. I will write number. And then is
it required? Yes it is required. So I
will write true. Then age can have
maximum and minimum. So we will write
minimum 1 and then max can go up till
like
let's say 150. Okay. So after this we
are done with this post model file. I
will save this. And now the another
thing which we will write is the post
controller. So now why are we not
writing this post thing also in the user
controller. We can write it and it won't
crack, it won't crash. But for the
readability we will write another file
which will be post dot controller.js.
So now in this controller all the roots
of posts will come and the controller
will be deciding what kind of responses
has to go on those requests which are
coming for posts. So this is how you can
manage your code files nicely and
increase readability. Okay. So for this
file we are going to write we will first
import the post model because we are
going to use that here. So I will write
post and then from
from the models f folder and the post
model js. After this the first thing
which we are going to write is to create
a post. CRUD has C in its first place
which means create a post. So I will
write
create a post. For this we are going to
make a constant named as create post
and then we will be using async here
also. And then a response then an arrow
function. We will be using try and catch
as we always do. And then I will make
another constant which will be the
request body which we want from the user
to create a post. To create a post they
need to write a name, a description
and uh and the age of that character.
After that we will just write request
dot. These are the things we want in the
body of request. After this I will write
a normal if else statement because what
if the user doesn't write a name but
writes the description and age. We
cannot register that post. So I will
write name and then description
and then age. So what I'm specifying
here is that I want all these three
things or we cannot post. So if either
one of them is not provided by the user,
we will give them an error which will be
rest dot status 400 because they have
given us
invalid fields. So I will write it as a
message message like all fields
are required. So this is the message the
user will see and they will then know
that yes all the fields are required.
Then what if the user gave us all the
fields. So at that point you will have
to create the post. So I will write it
as const post because we are going to
create the post. Now we will use await
and then the post model dot create
see and then I will normally use
parenthesis and then curly brackets and
write name description and then age.
Now we have to give a response also. So
it will be a 201 response because
something has been created on the
website and our backend server will give
this response and with the message named
as post
created
successfully.
Now for the catch error I will write
rest dot status 500.json.
And you know what message we are going
to give here which will be internal
server error. So internal
server error. Now we will write a normal
export for this file.
Here I will write create post.
And yes that's it. The controller has
been made. Now the next thing is that we
want to make a root file. I will again
make a new file for the post routes to
maintain the readability in our code
files. So I will make a new post route
js file. Now in here you need to import
router first of all. So I will import
router
and then from express
then I will import the create post
controller. So I will write
okay this is the option I'm getting. So
I will just click on it and the whole
line comes here. So it is getting the
create post from the postcontroller dot
js file. Okay we are good to go now. Now
now it is normal like the one we did in
the authentication APIs. You just make a
constant router and then you write it
like this. Then on the next line you
just write the route to your create post
model. Sorry create post route. So you
write it as router.t route. And then
we will call it as create for now. Then
we are creating some data on the
website. So we will use the HTTP method
post. Here also this goes in these.
Okay. Now you write the constant name
here which is create post and this is
it. Then in the app dot js file here
also you need to make new roots. Till
now we were only using this user router
but now that we have made another post
router. So we need to import that also
here which is going to be post router
from dot routes folder from post route
dojs and then I will declare the root
also here as app dot use and then it
will be the same API v1. Now here in the
place of users I will write posts and
and yes it is named as post router. So I
will name it as post router. Now I think
we are good to go to test this API of
creating a post on our website on
postman. So I will go on to postman and
from here I will click on this plus
button to create a new collection which
will be a blank collection. You click on
this and then you get to a new
collection. We will name it as CRUD
because we are making the CRUD APIs in
this. Then I will click on this plus
button and then I will get to a new
request. This request could be named as
create post.
Okay, the method is going to be post
because we are creating data on the
website. And the URL is going to be
pretty same like let's copy this one and
then come back here and then just cut
till the users and write posts and
create. Okay. Now for the headers, how
do you know what kind of headers we want
to use? You can just go to the post
controller and see what kind of request
dobody we are taking from the user. So
name, description and age. we use the
content type header which will go with
application/json
the server is going to parse that then
in the body I will select raw which will
be into JSON and I will just write a
name which can be let's say kina and
then
basically I'm making a character so I
need to write the name description and
description can be a martial Art artist
okay and then I have age let's write the
age let's say 26 so I will just save it
and send it
okay the request model does not provide
an export
oh so in the routes folder I did not
write a export yeah so I will write
export default router now I think The
server should start. Yes, the server has
started. Now, one more thing which I
noticed was that in the post controller
file, we are getting some error here.
That's why I am seeing these in faded.
So, okay. So, this is the bracket I
think
I
used wrong. Okay. So, now we are good to
go. Now let's go on to postman and send
it.
So now we can see that we have a message
which is post created successfully. The
post has a name, a description and age
and then it has its own ID then created
at updated at because we wrote
timestamps in the model and version is
zero of this document. Now that we have
created a post, we can keep creating
posts as in we can make another post
named as lemon. So this person is a sore
person and its age is 150 which was the
limit we seted as the max one and now
save it and send it. So now we have
created a character named lemon and you
can just keep on creating this but we
will make our another API now which is
to get all the posts. So think of it
like you are on Instagram and you want
to just get your feed. To get your feed
you don't need to give any request dot
body. You don't uh need to give give
anything. You just need to get all the
posts. To get all the post we are going
to make another API in the same post
controller. So let's write another one
which will be named as const get posts.
Write it as read all posts. So now in
this also we are going to use a sync. So
I will just copy this and paste it here.
Then inside this I will write again try
and catch const get posts. Then again I
will use await here and then we are
going to show the user. We need to find
all the posts and for that I will just
write find here which will find all the
post which are uploaded on our website
and then we will give a nice response
for it which will be a good 200 response
and that will be in JSON and then we
will write post
because that is our
constant here and then we will again
write okay then we will write the error
of catch. So I can just copy this
because we are writing the same error
one after another. So I will just write
it here as the okay
so I have written this. Now we can save
it. Okay. So we are good to go. Now let
me just separate these. Okay. Now the
next thing is that you go onto the
routes folder and then you again copy
this paste this here and write
get posts.
This is going to be a get method. So I
will change the method from post to
guest get get here and I will write the
name as
get post because that was the name of
our constant
actually let me check again. Yes, this
was it.
So okay here in the constant I had to
write posts and now I will export it.
get post and now I think we are good to
go and we can we have made the routes
also so we can test this on postman now
so let's go on to postman create a new
request name it as get all posts and we
will okay so the http method is going to
be the get one only now I will just use
this one and then in the place of create
we will write the one we wrote in our
code which is in the roots folder get
post so I am going to write this let's
copy it and write this here
now what about the headers so headers
are used when you are like if you are
using the content type header which is
to parse into JSON but we are not giving
any data so No data has to be passed. So
we are not going to use a header here. A
header which could be used here was the
authorization header in which you would
give the application your access token
so that it can authorize you and show
you all post but we are not doing that
here. And in the body also we don't need
any body. So I will just save it and
send it. Oh, we need to start our server
first. Wait a minute.
Okay. So, we have some error here. Get
post is is not defined. It says in this
in the post roots folder
the Okay. So, here in this import file I
have not imported get posts which is
correct. So yes. So now now I think the
server started. So we can now send it.
Okay. So, it gives an error. Check how
if I have written the wrong URL. But I
think it's right because it's post and
then get post.
Uh oh. So, uh when I copied this, I got
post here. But we need to have get here.
So, I think this was the only problem.
Let's save and send it. Yes. So now you
can see that we have got a list of all
the posts we made. This was a test post
which I made earlier. This is the kina
post and this is the lemon post which we
just made. So this is how you get a list
of all the posts you made. So this is
how our get post API works. Now let's
make another API which is going to be
the update post API in which we will be
able to update our already made posts.
So for that I will go to the post
controller and then I will make a new
function named as const update post.
Again we will be using async here and
then request response arrow function.
Then we will start writing
our validations.
So we won't have a lot of validations
here only one which is that the user is
not giving us empty data. So for that
I'm going to write uh first of all let's
write this is the basic validation for
to to check
if the body is empty because we don't
want the user to give us empty bodies
and then our API is handling them. So
this is the most basic validation we'll
be writing here. So a if statement and
then object dot keys. So what actually
is this object dot keys? Now let's write
a bit here also that this is for our
request dot body. Now what does this do?
So our request do body is a string and
let's see here how this works.
So basically what is happening is that
this kind of
like see if we have three input fields
name description and age. So the name
was anything let's say it is x and then
the description
is y and then the age is z. So this is
the string we have. Now the thing
happening is here that we want to
calculate the length of this thing. If
the length is zero that means the given
data from the user is zero and which is
equal to empty which we won't be going
ahead with. So this is the kind of
string data we are having in request do
body. Object dot keys is something which
converts this thing into an array and
array of keys. So it takes out the keys
from this string. Keys are this is the
key and this x is its value. So these
are key value pairs. So we will just get
the keys from here like name,
description
and age. So these are only the keys. Now
these will be counted as fields. So this
is field number 1 2 and three. And if
the field number the field length is
equal to zero that means that our given
body is empty and we will give an error
message that you need to give all these
things to update your post. Now I will
write here dotlength which is equal
equals to zero. So if it is equal to
zero that means we will give an return
response status
which will be a 400 because
the data was not provided which we need.
So the message will be
no data provided
for update. So this is the kind of
message we can write here and then
semicolons here. Also one thing which
you must be thinking here is that why
can't we just keep the request dot body
and let this string be calculated. So
the thing here is that if you know in
JavaScript if we get this kind of curly
braces which are empty it is known as
truthy values which is not reliable
because if this comes as a truthy value
you won't be getting a good response
which will be empty which we want here.
So that's why we don't use this because
JavaScript behaves differently with the
strings and arrays and that's why this
thing is called as truthy value. So we
won't be using this. Okay. Now the next
thing is that what if the [snorts] user
gave us the values. So for that we will
be updating their post and for that I
will write here const post post equals
to await and then the big post which is
our post model and we will find the
post. We need to find the post to update
it. So to find the post we need to write
find by id and then update it. Here also
we need to write and update and then the
usual will come request dot parents.
This is also a new thing here
because the id of the post will be taken
out from the parameter URL from where
you created the post. So we will be
seeing this thing in postman just after
some time. So yes and then request do
body
and then there is also a new thing which
is new equals to true. So now that we
have updated the post we need the new
post which will have the new values and
I will put it as true because we need
the new one the new post which has been
updated. Now also another if else
statement here should be that what if we
couldn't find the post. So for that I
will write if we couldn't find the post
we will return a response as res dot
status which will be 404 because it was
not found and dot JSON parentheses
and then we will give a normal message
as post not found and then semicolon
here. After that if our post was created
we found the post and we updated it. So
now we need to give a 200 response which
will be that yes your post was updated.
So I will write it as JSON and then
parenthesis curly brackets and the
message will be post
updated
successfully. And [clears throat] this
is a post. So I will write post here.
And yes, we are done with this. Now the
next and the last thing is that we will
catch an error here. So for that I can
just copy the above error because this
always stays the same. I will copy this
and paste it over here. Okay.
Now we can write that post couldn't be
updated also. just but we can just write
internal server error because it is on
the server's fault and then the next
thing is that we need to export it also.
Okay. So there is some problem with
this. Let's see where it is not coming
right. So okay now it is correct. So we
need to export it. I will just copy the
name from here. So let's copy it and
then paste it here. save the file and
then we will go to the routes folder
which is here. I will copy this same
line and paste it here
and we can write here as
update. I will only write update here
because we can write the full constant
name here here. Yes, like this. So when
I clicked enter I can see that update
post came in this import line also. So
that's a good thing. Now one more thing
that here we have the HTTP method which
we need to use. This is clearly not a
get method one request but it's a patch
one. So we have put and patch as HTTP
methods to update data. Now patch one is
for updating some of the data and put is
for updating the whole data. So we will
use patch here and this is more reliable
also. The next thing is that update will
have an ID because we need to find the
particular post by its ID by its unique
ID to update it. So here we will put
that post's ID also. Okay, let's save
this and our server is running fine and
then we will go to postpan. We will
create a new request named as update
post.
[snorts] Then I can just copy the URL
like we can go for this and then in the
place of create I will write update
because we have update here and then
update we have an ID here. So ID will
come like this but the ID shouldn't be
written like this. We need to really get
the unique ID here and put it here. So
when we created the post of this lemon
one, we got an unique ID here. So I will
just copy this and then go here and then
in the place of ID, I will put it. Then
I will change this method to patch
because we are updating just some of the
data. And then I can go into the
headers. I have this content type which
is application/json
already. And then in the body also we
got this. So let's just change it a bit.
In the place of lemon let's write lily.
So lily is a flower. And I can write
here
a cute flower.
Okay.
Age age can be two. And then we will
save it and then we will send it.
So we got another error. Okay. So in
this error we can see that object ID
failed for value. It's saying that it's
not complete. So let's go here and see.
Okay. So I did not copy it fully. This
six was left. So let's copy it again and
copy it and then go into here and again
write it. So now I have it full six here
also. Now again save it and send it.
Okay. Now we have got 200. Okay. That
means post was updated successfully. And
then its name was changed to Lily acute
flower age 2. And then these timestamps
version zero. You can see the ID is
still the same because the document is
still the same. You just change its
values. So this is how it is. And now we
can just go on to VS code and make our
last API for this video which is going
to be the delete API. So now what I want
to do is as a user want to delete this
whole post. For that I will go on to the
post controller and make a new
function named as const delete post.
So now we want to delete the post and
for that I will always like always times
I will use async
then the same request response and then
an arrow function in it I will use try
and catch and then here okay so in
delete post you don't need to have a lot
of validations and I'm not writing any
here we will just go on to our constant
which is delete Ed
and then I will write await here.
Then from the post model I'll be finding
the id. So find by id
and delete now. So this time it is going
to be delete
and then I will write request dot params
because from the parameter URL of the
post id will get its unique id. So that
is it and then
we will return a good response which
will be okay for first of all before
that we need to write an if statement
also because what if you couldn't delete
the post because you just couldn't find
the post. So it will be same as post not
found which we also wrote in the in the
update one. So I will just write here
deleted and then we will return a
response as
404 because that is what says post not
found dot JSON and then a message which
will say post not found.
Okay, I forgot the quotes here. Okay. So
it is correct now. Post not found. And
then this I think something is wrong
here. Uh okay. So
yes, now I will return a response when
we can just write response dot status
here which will be a 200 because we were
successfully able to delete your post
after we found the ID. If it was not
found then you just get the 404 message,
the 404 response. But if it was found
then you get a message that yes your
post
post
successfully
deleted.
Okay. After this a mandatory catch
message which I will just copy from here
and put it here. So we are done with
this.
Now I will save the file. uh our server
is running very fine and then I will
export this which is delete post.
Then on the roots file I will go and
again copy this and write it here. Now
this time we are deleting it. So I will
just write delete and then again you
need the ID of the post. So I will have
ID here as it is and then as the method
it will be changed to delete. I will
have to write delete post. You can see I
am I'm getting this third option. I will
click on this and it will get delete
post in this import line. So that's a
good thing. And then save this.
And now I think we are good to go to
test this on Postman. I will go on to
Postman and then I will again create a
new request named as
delete post.
Then I will have the URL. URL
can be so we got the update one. I will
just change it this into delete.
And then I think this is the same as one
which we just updated. So yes, this is
the same. So we will just keep it
because we want to delete that lemon one
post. We don't need any headers here
because we are not giving any data which
need to be passed. Also, we don't need
any body here. So, I will just clean
this and then just save it and send it.
Okay. So, uh I did not change this patch
into delete. So, let's change it this
into delete and then save it again and
send it. So, now you can see we got a
200 okay with a message post
successfully deleted. So by now we have
made four APIs which were create post,
get all post, update post and delete
post and the another one were
authentication APIs which were register,
login and log out. Now we can just go on
VS code and we can push this all good
code on GitHub. So I will just write
here that we also added some more
features which were add
CRUD. Okay, let's write it as like add
CRUD APIs. So this is it. I will commit
it and then sync changes.
So yes, that was a wrap and in this
video I hope that you guys got a basic
understanding of what and how a backend
looks like and works that do with
Postman where you can test your APIs and
what are APIs like in the actual world.
Now uh you can tinker with this and you
can expand it very much. You can have a
lot of validations, you can have
indexes, you can generate tokens and you
can do a lot of things and that is what
backend is which is the behind the
scenes of a website. So let me know in
the comments how you are doing with back
end and what you guys are trying and
what you got to learn from this video.
Thanks for watching."

that kind of naturally formed
communities. Vue is more than just a
core library. There is a whole suite of
things like there's the official router,
there's the state management library,
there is the language tools, the IDE
extension, there's the developer tools
extension that runs in Chrome, the V
related plugins, there was Vue CLI. Over
the years, I kind of narrowed my focus
only on the Vue Core library. And I
never intentionally recruited people to
work on these things. Well, I actually
recruited one person to help me maintain
Vuecore full-time, but he was just a
part-time contributor. He was just
generally interested in these problems.
And he started sending more and more
PRs. And similarly, all these other
people who maintain these different
pieces, they kind of just step into
those roles naturally. And I was able to
delegate. So without the delegation, I
wouldn't be able to even have the
bandwidth to even consider taking on
other other"

podcast. I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and
founder of free codecamp.org. And today
we're talking with Harvard computer
science professor and CS50 instructor
David Men. He's taught millions of
people programming and this is going to
be quite an interview. Let's first take
a look at some quick community news. Uh,
Free Code Camp just published a one-hour
course that will teach you how
cryptography works and how developers
use it to secure both data and
communications. Free Code Camp published
this course to teach you Python
functions for symmetric and asymmetric
encryption. You'll learn about Shaw 256,
AES, RSA, and public private keys as
well. You'll even code your own command
line cryptography tool. It's a 1-hour
course on the Free Code Camp YouTube
channel. As with everything we do,
totally free. Check it out after you
finish listening to this podcast. Free
Coke Camp also published a course on
building your own 3D games that run in a
browser using 3JS and Blender. I am so
hyped about 3JS. I have loved this
technology ever since I first saw it.
You'll learn how to model characters,
design levels, detect collisions, and
make the camera follow your playable
character. You'll even deploy your own
game to the cloud so your friends can
play it right in their browsers. It's a
six-hour YouTube course. We also
published a course that will teach you
advanced JavaScript architecture. This
is a fulllength handbook that you can
bookmark for your own reference that you
can read. It's got tons of code
examples. You're going to learn about
event loops, task cues, call stacks,
back pressure, websockets, pub sub
models, and more. Take your full stack
development skills to the next level.
And be sure to share this with your
developer friends. This is going to be a
great reference for you going forward.
Free Coke Camp also published our first
ever guitar course. That's right. We're
doing music courses. You'll learn
beginner music theory concepts like
chords and scales. Then you'll map them
to the guitar fretboard. You'll also
learn guitar specific techniques like
bar chords. I learned guitar during the
pandemic and I am having an absolute
blast playing it and I hope you will
too.
Then I wanted to share with you this
year's uh JS13K winner. So JS 13K is a
competition where you try to code a game
that fits in 13 kilobytes of JavaScript.
That's not a lot of space. You got to
get the sound, the assets, everything.
And so this game is called uh I I
actually can't remember the name and I
didn't write it down, but it is a cat
stealth game in the browser. I've got a
link to it in the description. and
you're a cat sneaking around trying to
get revenge for your master who has been
executed by one of these hoodlams. And
uh you sneak around, you can like meow
to distract them. It's very Metal Gear
Solidish. And it's just really fun. It's
a quick game. I played it for like 20
minutes and got to level nine. I
couldn't get past level 9. If you get
past level 9, comment if you beat the
entire game, tell us your high score in
terms of speed and number of deaths. Uh
this is one of those games where you can
die a bunch of times and uh just keep
coming back and it's just about getting
better. But it's a great game and it
fits in 13 kilobytes of JavaScript.
Insane.
Other thing I want to do is share this
awesome song with you. The song of the
week is 1988's Kiss Like Judas by UK
band It Bites. I love the interplay of
the FM synthesizers, the guitar slashes.
I also love the steady off-kilter guitar
arpeggios throughout the verses and even
the vocal harmonies. Listen to this one
with headphones. Again, I've got a link
to it in the description. Check it.
Then, I wanted to pitch the Free Code
Camp shirt. It is made right here in the
States by Raphael uh Hernandez, who
hosts the Free Code Camp podcast, and he
also has his own screen printing
business. And we will ship it to you
anywhere in the States. If you're
outside the States and you want to get
one of these highquality tribal shirts,
uh tough. We We don't do international
shipping anymore. It's just too
unreliable and too costly. Uh but you
can just take the logo from uh one of
our assets directories and you can print
your own shirts if you'd like for
non-commercial use just for your own
personal use. But these shirts are 20
bucks. Super reasonable. I wear one
almost every day. I've washed it
hundreds of times and it just never
wears out. Uh it will eventually wear
out I guess if you wash it like tens of
hundreds of times which would mean
thousands of times. So let's jump to our
interview. Very hyped to have Dr. David
J. Mail on the podcast again. I had him
on in 2019, so six years ago. Uh over
the past decade, millions of people have
taken his CS50 course over at Harvard,
both in person and online. He joins us
to talk about why he still recommends
learning the C programming language in
2026. uh how he intentionally nerves
nerfs his students coding editors and
LLMs to help them learn fundamentals
faster, his vision for self-paced
learning and how it improves on
traditional university education and
where he thinks the software engineering
field is heading in light of recent AI
tool improvements.
David Mail, welcome to the Free Code
Camp podcast.
>> Thanks so much for having me.
Yeah, I just want to dive right into AI
because this is the big thing that
everybody's talking about right now,
grappling with in both education and in
software development.
>> You uh as part of CS50
encourage students to disable a lot of
code editor features like auto spacing,
tab completion, and essentially take
away a lot of the power of the code
editor. Why do you encourage students to
do this?
>> I would say it's stronger than that.
It's not so much encourage as it is we
require them to turn these things off or
at least we do so for them by default in
CS50's programming environment which is
essentially a cloud-based version of VS
Code. It's specifically to enable them
and empower them to develop the muscle
memory that so many of us after
programming for years take for granted.
But in those first few days, first few
weeks, even months or years of learning
how to program, I do think there's value
in actually having to remember some of
that syntax and get into the habit of
creating it yourself. And then these
tools like autocomplete and the like
really are meant to be productivity
boosters once you know what you're
actually doing. And so we do for
instance toward the end of CS50 when we
get to the world of HTML have students
uh allowed to uh have those tags
automatically generated for them. If
they open the tag it'll be closed for
them because that's partic not
particularly intellectually interesting
to be typing really the same thing you
just typed to open the tag. Um, but by
the end of the semesters too, students
are welcome to offboard themselves from
what we call csf.dev, which is our
cloud-based environment and turn on
anything and everything of interest to
them for their final project.
>> Okay. And when you do software
development yourself, to what extent do
you use uh LLMs?
>> Oh, LLMs increasingly. I mean, I have a
conversation with CHPT about one thing
or another. Probably most every day
nowadays. been experimenting uh all the
more with GitHub copilot which is one of
the in uh IDE uh AIS that you can use
nowadays uh experimented the other day
with claude code which is another
popular one. So I think my own usage is
only going to go up and up and up just
as it is for us in the course. Yeah, and
of course you just emphasized that
people need to learn how to do things
properly manually before they start.
What I often say is you need to learn
how to use your basic tools, your your
hammers and your saws before you break
out, you know, the power tools, the
chainsaws, the jackhammers and stuff.
And uh it sounds like you're thinking
the same thing in terms of uh people who
are coming fresh to programming that
they should learn how they should learn
like the basics. Uh one question I have
for you is how important is it to learn
all the data structures, algorithms, the
things that are traditionally tested in
job interviews? Uh you hear people
talking about like completing a lot of
leak code type challenges. How important
do you think that is going to be right
now and going forward with uh LLM being
able to produce boilerplate, you know,
code really quickly?
>> Oh, I mean all of those fundamentals,
data structures, algorithms and the
like. I mean that's what computer
science and really what engineering is
is an understanding of those
fundamentals, those building blocks that
you can assemble into projects of your
own. Uh it's the code and the syntax
that was never all that intellectually
interesting. And while it's valuable to
understand what it is you are typing
initially or what the AI is doing
ultimately, I think it just lends itself
ultimately to a better understanding of
the solutions you are creating with AI's
help to problems. So those fundamentals
I don't think are going away at all. I
think maybe memorization of or practice
with very specific APIs or function
signatures and the like that's always
been and can remain less interesting.
And I think that's what AI is really
helping with right now is enabling us to
do the fun part of solving problems and
assembling those building blocks without
having to worry about exactly what the
glue looks like.
>> Do you worry that developers in the
future are going to be doing more code
review than actual coding? And do you
think that that is going to be a net
negative for the field?
>> That's a really interesting question.
Um, and it's timely in so far as I've
indeed been playing with Copilot and
Claude Code and the like. And I find
that for instance, most recently in some
bug fix or feature that I was trying to
have Copilot implement, it was sort of
akin to the quality of like a junior
developer where I as the human did
indeed need to review code and I sort of
overrode some of its design decisions
and redid some things myself. It was
still helpful because it got me started.
I didn't have to slog through the
documentation to figure out this or
that. So, still was a productivity
boost, but it did cost me some time. Um,
I think my own interest in software
engineering would grind to a halt if all
I were doing was reviewing someone
else's or something else's code. But I
think this is probably a short-term
period in which we are spending maybe a
disproportionate amount of time
reviewing code that the AI has
generated. And I think we'll have to
spend less and less of that in time as
the AI gets better and better and we can
rather trust like a good PM that the
engineer even if it's an AI is solving
the problem as we would intend.
>> Yeah. And can you talk about what you
think that period is? So we had the
before uh LLM tab completion like really
before LLMs were used outside like
visibly by developers. They've been used
for years uh essentially for like Google
Translate and and tools like that kind
of behind the scenes but before they
became like a part of many developers
day-to-day workflow. What do you think
the next few periods look like? So right
now we're in the okay we do have to do a
lot of code review period. Do you have
any predictions for when and how that's
going to change to where we can hand
over more of the decision- making or or
the actual I I guess kind of like lower
level decision-m to LM without having to
babysit them as much.
>> Yeah, I mean no predictions that you
should trust because I think all of us
are just sort of guessing and going with
gut here. I will say I have been
consistently surprised over the past few
years how quickly things are in
advancing and how much better each uh
iteration of GPT for instance is from
OpenAI uh and their counterparts. Um so
I think you can probably take with a
grain of salt what I am inclined to say
but I would say just after a couple more
years I think we'll be worrying a little
bit less certainly within well-
definfined domains like software
engineering about hallucinations so to
speak about uh improper coding decisions
and I say this because all of these
tools increasingly let you tell them a
little something about your coding
preferences your imple your preferred
implementation details whether it's in
the form of a big markdown file or
something else that they're getting
better and better at adhering to. So
much like you would be training a human
uh junior developer to get better and
better. I dare say that's what's
happening already with some of these
AIs. And so I think within a small
number of years will we worry a little
bit less about having the same
conversation about the the fine print
the disclaimers that we have to put when
it comes to the these AIs writing code.
I think more likely certainly for non-m
missionritical type applications
self-driving cars and the like where
there's actually safety components
involved. I think it will probably
suffice to just look at the behavior of
the final product. Look at the web pages
for instance that are being dynamically
generated or QA it from a user
perspective at a higher level as opposed
to getting into the weeds of the actual
code. So I do think within a you know
medium number of years interpret as you
will uh we might have to worry less
about what the code looks like too. Um
but even then for the most important of
applications I think some smart humans
should be really getting their hands
dirty still.
>> Okay. Agree or disagree with this
statement and you can elaborate.
>> Okay. Within the next 10 or 15 years,
developers jobs are going to come become
more resembling
technical product managers. We think of
product managers today running like a
specific product and just technical
versions of those who can if necessary
dig under the hood.
>> Yes, I do suspect that's likely because
I think that's happening already. Uh I
for one who am not a full-time software
developer sort of welcome that future
because the part of software engineering
that I've always enjoyed is yeah sort of
the problem solving process but not so
much the code. I mean the fact is that
at least for me who enjoys coding as a
sort of hobby but also it's sort of
intertwined with my my vocation.
It's [snorts] just so much more work to
get all of the code out of my brain
through my fingertips and into the
computer than it is to sort of envision
how would I solve this problem. The fun
part for me is chatting with a buddy at
a whiteboard and sort of deciding like
what are our database tables going to
look like and what are the API calls
going to be look like and what's the URL
format or what's the UI going to look
like. all of the sort of highlevel
decisions that ultimately a PM would be
involved with and it starts for me
personally to get a lot less interesting
that I now need to sort of start
churning through that to-do list and
implement all of those wise decisions I
think I just made.
>> Yeah. And with that in mind, uh, talking
a little bit about the way you teach
CS50 students, and for most of the
people in CS50, this is just their first
exposure to programming and computer
science, but you do start with C. Uh,
and you do teach the C programming
language
>> and that is very low level. you're
worrying about uh you know memory
management and uh you're basically
accomplishing extremely simple things
when you program with that versus using
JavaScript or Python or uh even you know
building like an app where your LLM is
helping you with a lot of the
boilerplate or you're pulling in like
powerful libraries and things like that.
What is the value [clears throat] in
2025 2026 of still learning C? It is the
same as it was in October of 2022 before
Chachi PT came out. I think it's to
understand from the ground floor up how
computers work, how systems are
designed, what it is these programming
languages are doing for us. And I think
perhaps most importantly to really help
students appreciate that it's not magic.
Like at the end of the day, the only
building blocks we have at our disposal
are these zeros and ones. And inside of
a computer, there's hardware, but that
stores these zeros and ones and performs
operations on them like math. And when
you think about your computer's memory
as really just being this canvas of like
a whole bunch of zeros and ones that you
can lay out however you want, I think
there's something sort of liberating
about that in so far as surely nothing
we're doing in CS50 can be all that
complicated if at the end of the day it
reduces to just zeros and ones. And so
when we talk be by way of C about
pointers and memory management and how
you can actually build an array or a
linked list or a hash table or anything
more at the end of the day you truly
have this bottomup understanding of how
it all works. And I think the dispelling
of the other what you might otherwise
perceive as magic is just incredibly
empowering because I think for many
students a takeaway from that learning
process is like okay I got this and
that's indeed what we mean by building a
foundation. And I think it's less
interesting, less important to go and
build your own link list or hashts or
the like down the line. But
understanding what they do, I think is
compelling. And I also think in CS50
where we transition in the class from C
to Python, it is wonderfully eyeopening
when we transition over the course of
one week from our so-called week five to
week six that we can take the dozens of
lines of code we wrote the previous week
to implement a large hash table into a
single line instantiating a Python
dictionary object. And that is exactly
what we've meant all prior weeks when we
talk about encapsulation and abstraction
and and the like.
>> Yeah. I mean that's got to be a
remarkable moment like kind of an
inflection point in the learning where
uh I often liken like learning
programming to the movie the karate kid
where he's learning the basic movements.
So wax on wax off put his jacket on the
hook take it off. he doesn't necessarily
understand why he's doing all this, but
once he goes to the karate tournament,
he understands that all the key muscle
memory and all the key movements uh
necessary to they all kind of come
together and he's able to do it. And
part of that is just the the movie being
dramatic and uh not actually telling him
why he's doing these, you know, very
boring chores and these very boring
drills. But I do think that to an extent
uh what you're teaching in CS50 is those
skills coming together and suddenly boom
a single line you accomplish a week's
worth of work two weeks worth of work in
terms of uh writing a whole lot of
different um
>> you know very micromanagy code. So
that's that's really cool.
>> Agreed.
>> Yeah. And I want to talk to you about
theatrics.
One of the things that you do as a
teacher is you try to illustrate, show,
not just tell, how a lot of these
concepts work. For example, binary
search where you're ripping the phone
book apart. Uh showing how that's like
an efficient uh algorithm for finding
somebody's name in a phone book, for
example. Uh, and I want to talk about
the role of those kinds of showing
versus telling and how you come up with
some of those ideas for demonstrating on
the stage in front of all your students.
>> Yeah. Well, the latter question is easy.
I keep an eye on what other teachers are
doing and undoubtedly many most of those
demonstrations that I've adopted for
CS50 came in some form from some prior
teacher. In fact, the earliest one I can
remember is that on some years in CS50,
we talk about algorithms and the
importance of precision, step-by-step
instructions to give some other human or
computer or robot. And we do a peanut
butter and jelly making example. And
there was a dad and his child that went
viral a few years back for doing exactly
this on the internet. Like, hey, wait a
minute. My home room teacher in fifth
grade did exactly that for us. And her
goal at the time was to demonstrate just
how important it was for fifth graders
to follow directions carefully. And she
did this by way of having us give her
instructions for how to make a peanut
butter and jelly sandwich. And the mere
fact that I'm talking about this um what
30, 40 years later, I think is testament
to just the power of those memorable
moments where the overarching goal is to
instill in someone an understanding of
what could be an a a difficult a
challenging topic. But the goal is to
give them some visual or at least some
mental model that they can cling to when
trying to master that same topic. And so
with the phone book in CS50, the
overarching goal is to make a fairly
arcane topic like binary search and
logarithmic uh running time a lot more
real because students have that real
world example that even as the jargon
gets complicated and the ideas might
start to evolve to be all the more
sophisticated. They have that very
simple thing that even they could do at
home. And so much of what we do on the
stage in CS50 is really meant to give
students by way of theatricality
memorable moments that stay with them
far longer than some of the jargon or
the acronyms or the technical terms that
we might use verbally alone.
>> So you spent a great deal of time
thinking about these different ways of
conveying and making these concepts
memorable. uh and it sounds like that's
paying off a lot if you're able to uh
draw from your own personal experience
things that you have not forgotten over
the years and uh for people who are
getting into teaching uh and I I want to
address the teachers in the audience uh
of course I'm a former ESL teacher and
we have like pretty much everybody on
the free co camp team and a lot of
people in the free co contributor
community have a teaching background as
well uh what are some ways that you go
about thinking
and discovering these kinds of analogies
that you can teach. Of course, you said
you uh heavily draw from what you see
other people doing that works. But uh
what is one that you've come up with by
yourself that you're really proud of?
>> So during COVID times we had the
opportunity to collaborate with another
local theater, the American Reparatory
Theater in Cambridge, whose team was
otherwise furoughed because of everyone
was at the time working from home. So
there were no shows to put on. But we
had this wonderfully unique opportunity
in the fall of 2020 to collaborate with
this team of artisans, electricians and
carpenters and prop masters to bring to
life a lot of the physicality that you
enjoy in a physical space like a
theater. And so they helped us bring to
life any number of computer science
topics that way uh that year in ways
that I couldn't have done on my own. And
one of those was to help students
visualize a linked list, which for those
less familiar is this data structure in
memory where you have so-called nodes,
chunks of memories that are somehow
linked together underneath the hood by
way of pointers or in higher level
languages via something like called
references. And I had always fancied the
idea of trying to bring this to life by
using actual wooden blocks and somehow
interconnect them. And so with some
input to the prop masters there and
their their wood shop, they kindly built
these wooden nodes in the form of wooden
boxes. They had uh disconnected
electrical outlets in one in uh a orange
extension cord coming out of the other.
And the whole point was that on stage
while filming that year with no students
present, just a stage and some cameras,
we could literally interconnect these
nodes by plugging the orange extension
cable from one box into the other into
the other into the other. And I loved
that they were able to bring this to
life. My regret with that particular
visualization was that when they asked
me how big do I want these blocks to be,
I just kind of spitled like, oh, I don't
know, 3 feet, 4 feet, something like
that. Not at all appreciating how damn
heavy a 3 or 4 foot cylindrical block of
wood would actually be. And you can see
me even the video like struggling to
move these things around stage to sort
of maloclock them one out after another.
So, it was a nice idea, but poor
execution on my part. Um the the
carpenters did it exactly to spec. So we
have since disassembled those blocks of
wood, but uh the irony is that's perhaps
now more of a memorable moment for me
than for anyone else. But that was one
that I don't think I borrowed from
someone else because no one was crazy
enough to build such a thing.
>> Yeah. Yeah. I mean that reminds me of
the documentary mockumentary uh Spinal
Tap. This is Spinal Tap. If anybody has
seen that, you'll know exactly what I'm
talking about here. Uh great great uh
documentary if you're just late at night
you want to watch but yeah the carpenter
followed your instructions exactly but
that uh ended up being uh a lot of
backachche for you it sounds like so
>> yeah in the CS education community
there's this recurring theme of things
that seemed like a good idea at the time
which was that uh but not in the end.
>> Yeah. Well I want to talk a little bit
about CS50 itself. So the course
precedes you and and that's so cool that
you ultimately took over the course and
have you know elevated it to incredible
levels of prominence like literally
millions of students uh on edex YouTube
like all these different platforms are
going through the course and uh learning
a tremendous amount of computer science
of course free code camp we've published
a lot of your videos over the years
including a security video which I love
and I'm just going to I don't want to
spoil the course for anybody, but I did
go through the the course. And I love
how you teach social engineering
[laughter] uh in in a very illustrative
way. You're like, ""All right, everybody,
write down a password or write down one
of your passwords on this piece of
paper. Uh we're going to examine this.""
And and you basically trick people into
writing down a password and you're like,
""All right, I just social engineered
you."" And people are going to carry that
humiliation of like, ""Oh man, I got
duped that."" And they're never going to
forget what social engineering was,
especially the ones that actually wrote
the the name down. So in a very low
stakes way, you taught them a very
important lesson about security, right?
Um
let's talk a little bit about your
background with security
and that is what you study and I I
believe your your dissertation was
security focused uh when you did your
PhD, right?
>> It was. Yeah. On the rapid detection of
zero day outbreaks of internet worms,
which are like viruses that can spread
on their own.
>> Yeah. And a lot of people think, oh,
he's the more general CS guy, like he
teaches computer science in general. But
you do have that area of specialization.
And um what inspired you to create like
a CS50 course that's focused on
security?
>> Oh, so with CS50 cyber security, that's
just long been an interest of mine from
graduate school and even prior. So that
certainly informed my graduate studies.
Um, it's just so practical though
nowadays and it's just so important for
technical and non people non-technical
people alike to have a foundation of
understanding in what the threats are
out there, what the possible defenses
are to give them a healthy fear of
things they could do wrong when it comes
to something as mundane as like opening
their email and what can go wrong. Um, I
think it's very much consistent with
CS50's overarching vision of providing
students with the fundamentals of
understanding in any number of topics.
So cyber security felt to me a very
natural extension of that and it just so
happens to be ever more practical for a
broader audience even than the lower
level courses like CS50X itself.
>> Yeah. And let's talk more generally
about CS50.
What is the history? And I want to point
out that I did interview you maybe like
five or six years ago and that recording
is on the free code camp RSS feed. Uh
you might be able to find it in like
Spotify or Apple podcast if you search
for it. But uh what how did you end up
running CS50? Like the just like the the
very quick explanation of how you ended
up here and uh what you've done since
you got it uh to expand.
>> Yeah. Right time, right place. So I took
the course myself in the fall of 1996
when I was a sophomore in university. Uh
fast forward to graduate school where I
returned to Harvard for 5 years to work
on my PhD. And the year I was
graduating, spring of 2007, the previous
instructor for the course was moving on
to become dean of the school. And there
was an opportunity, a need for someone
to fill in. Uh the
school was uh intending to have a senior
faculty member teach this introductory
gateway course for the undergraduates,
but somehow or other, I talked my way
into the job for what was supposed to be
one year, after which they would find
someone more senior to teach it. Somehow
or other, that was 19 years ago. um and
I'm still at the helm and it certainly
evolved as you note over time to have
not only this on-ampus component but a
very large um outward-f facing online
component not only through Harvard's
extension school and summer school but
through platforms like edex and YouTube
that have really challenged us to think
all the more about how you teach
effectively at scale how to provide
resources for students not only on
campus but off and generally treat the
entire community of CS50 as as one class
taking it as the shared experience
Yeah. And CS50 has expanded and there
are like different variants of CS50. For
example, I believe you have like a CS50
for MBA students like Master of Business
Administration. You have like a CS50 for
lawyers. Can you talk about these
variants and how they differ and how you
kind of tailor computer science as a
subject for people in other fields that
are unlikely to I guess go directly into
software engineering but will most
likely be working alongside software
engineers? Of course, uh there's a
popular book called uh physics for
presidents which the the essence of
which is all about well what are the
minimal what is the minimal physics
knowledge that a president should have
to make good decisions and I think
that's true of every field not just
about physics but about computer science
as well and so in crafting this course
at Harvard Business School about 10
years ago now aka CS50 for MBAs the goal
was still to empower students with a
bottomup understanding of how computers
and technology work but the overarching
goal was not necessarily to transform
them into engineers, but rather better
decision makers. And those aren't
certainly mutually exclusive. But the
reality is at the MBA level for graduate
students probably don't need to spend as
much time on how to stitch together a
linked list or data structure like a
hash table in memory using C and
pointers. Rather, let's teach them what
those data structures are. Let's use
abstractions. Let's use pictures so that
they have a general understanding of
what those building blocks are. even if
they're never going to build them
themselves, give them a taste of
programming, whether it's with Python,
we use Scratch in the class for a day as
well, so that they have a general sense
of what it is software engineers in the
real world actually do, but accepting
that this is not their goal
professionally or personally. And their
goal is to just better understand the
world around them when they go off into
the business world or the legal
profession or beyond. And so with both
of those courses, we take at the
ultimately more of a top-down approach
whereby we introduce students to some
salient concepts, whether it's cloud
computing or cyber security or the like
and then give them a familiarity with
the underlying building blocks that
built up those higher level
abstractions. And the business course is
focused there for more broadly on how
you can leverage technology at scale,
uh, store large amounts of data, crunch
lots of numbers, leverage artificial
intelligence. Nowadays, the law class
had a bit more of a focus on
intellectual property and cyber security
that might intersect with the world of
law. But at the end of the day, it was
all about empowering a broad citizenry
to make better decisions and better
understand the world of technology.
>> Yeah. And on that note, I really want to
kind of get any advice you have for
teachers who are potentially trying to
communicate the fundamentals of computer
science to people, especially if they
are giving just like a talk uh where
they have only maybe an hour to impart
some important concepts. when you're
dealing with, you know, people that are
focused on business or focused on law,
like how you figure out the amount of
detail, like the resolution if you're
going to present concepts.
>> I I think in my courses, we certainly
don't shy away from level of detail. And
I do think that most of our courses
probably combine more information, more
topics, more concepts than is typical in
a course. Even CS50 for instance is what
we have long called an amalgam of what
other universities call CS1 and CS2
combined. So there's a lot we move
quickly but the goal really is to enable
students to understand a broad a broad
spectrum of concepts within the limited
amount of time that we actually have
with them. As for how I decide what goes
in there I mean I just don't shy away
from really getting into the weeds. And
for instance in CS50 for MBAs and for
lawyers we talk about pointers. We don't
show them the syntax of dreferencing and
following pointers using say C syntax,
but we talk about them pictorially in
terms of like here's an arrow and here's
a grid of memory and here's how you can
stitch something together therein. And I
think that that is valuable for the same
reasons it's valuable for the
undergraduates taking the the flagship
core CS50X in that it just helps them
realize that there's really no magic
here. At the end of the day, it's just
zeros and ones, and I can use it however
I see fit. And this is how people who
have come before me have decided to use
it to build up these building blocks in
computing. And so, I think the challenge
though is getting students to that that
level of understanding when you're
starting with literally just the zeros
and ones. And so, I generally approach
it as telling a story. And where does
that story begin? In CS50, for instance,
and in all of those variants, we start
with zeros and ones. And if that's all
you had, all right, well, how do you
count to the number two, let alone three
and four and five? Well, we talk about
how you can permute the bits and
actually represent numbers in binary
notation. All right. Well, once we can
represent our decimal world of zeros
through nines using just binary, well,
what other problem should we solve?
Well, how about being able to send a
text message using English or some other
human language? So, we talk about ASI
and Unicode. From there, it's a natural
progression to like colors of the
rainbow and therefore images and
thereafter video, if not music. And so
by the end of just like an hour like
we've already talked about this massive
stack of abstractions that has been
developed over the years and I hope in
retrospect at student to students it
doesn't feel like it was actually that
scary a ride because we started from
zero we got up to 60 but there was an
acceleration that was continuous and not
just discreet jumps week to week. Yeah,
that's really uh beautiful the way that
you've figured out a way to so quickly
kind of remove a lot of people's
apprehension from learning more about
math and programming and computer
science through your course because I I
think people are daunted and they do
think it's magic and and it sounds like
you figured out a way to demystify it
very quickly in in a very pain like low
pain low uh apprehension way. So, I want
to talk a little bit about questions and
answers and the way that you've
traditionally dealt with people wanting
to get their questions answered, uh, for
example, through office hours, uh,
through having TAs that can check in
with learners. You have something called
the CS50 duck. And for those who are
listening who are unfamiliar with duck
debugging, maybe you can explain that
and then explain what the CS50 duck does
and just your more general thoughts on
AI assistance.
>> Sure. So for those unfamiliar, it's a
thing in programming to you leverage
what's called rubber duck debugging
whereby you literally keep an inanimate
object like a yellow rubber duck on your
desk and the in the absence of having a
colleague or a mentor or a family member
or friend who knows more about you than
uh about code than you do, you should
literally just talk to the rubber duck
and if you're having some confusion or
some bug or mistake in your code, just
tell the rubber duck about it. And
invariably that process of communicating
your confusion step by step often yields
to like that proverbial light bulb going
off over your head because you realize
I've been an idiot because you hear in
your own words the mistake or the
confusion that you've had. Doesn't
always work but it can certainly work.
And so the exercise of talking to a
rubber duck is just to help you express
what your confusion is in hopes that you
better understand the problem and
therefore can find your own way to a
solution. Now, in the absence of being
able to find your own way, nowadays we
have um co-opted that idea of a physical
rubber duck and virtualized it thanks to
some of our my colleagues and some of
our former students back home in the
form of a virtual rubber duck. It's
c50.ai that anyone on the internet with
a free GitHub account can access. And it
is attenuated specifically to CS50, but
it answers your questions in English or
really in any human language with which
you engage. And it is designed to have
some pedagogical guardrails in place so
to speak whereby we essentially have
aspired through code to make the default
version of chat GPT less helpful because
chat GPT as many have discovered is all
too willing to just solve all of your
problems for you if it can. Um not to
mention and do all of your homework for
you which is not I think most people
would agree educationally valuable. And
so we've tried to make it less helpful
our duck in the sense that it tries to
respond akin to a good teacher or tutor
whereby we try to have the duck lead
students to solutions as opposed to just
handing it to them outright by giving
them the code in question. So more often
than not, the duct is designed to
respond in English, not an actual C code
or Python code or anything else, and to
really respond with some frequency with
questions of the students so as to help
them even more so than the physical
rubber duck can get to the uh point of
clarity.
>> Okay. So it's kind of more of a Socratic
method type approach. I mean, you you
you talk about uh pedagogical
guardrails, essentially nerfing the LLM,
and this is a recurring theme, nerfing
the code editor, nerfing the LLM, making
the tools less powerful so you can kind
of force people to uh kind of learn how
to fly for themselves. They're you're
pushing them out of the nest. And uh
maybe that's not the the like an exact
analogy for what you're doing here, but
um can you talk about the evolution of
the duck and kind of there's also a
system I believe called ED that you've
used with uh CS50 and how that has
impacted learners and office hours.
>> Yeah, for our onampus students and also
our on uh our on-ampus students and also
our online students. We've long used a
cool tool called ED or edsteem.org or
which is a wonderful tool for Q&A, sort
of a modern version of the Q&A form that
you can use for a specific class. And
early on, it was used only for human
interactions among students and teachers
and including myself. Uh but very
quickly did we insert some of our own AI
features into ED by having a virtual
rubber duck respond to students
questions back in 2023
uh when OpenAI and others first started
releasing APIs or application
programming interfaces via which you
could leverage their services in your
own applications. Since then we've
evolved into having our own CS50.AI tool
which is essentially our own version of
chatbt. We've integrated this virtual
duck into cs50.dev dev which is our own
adaptation of GitHub code spaces which
is essentially VS code in the cloud so
that students do have at their
fingertips um these various AI based
tools that they can interact with either
by clicking buttons or interrogating
them with uh written questions.
>> Yeah. And what are some questions that
uh a learner might traditionally ask a
TA or ask you uh that they're now asking
uh either Ed or uh Duck AI uh
>> almost Oh, sorry. Go ahead.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead.
>> Almost everything. Um, we have seen a
marketked decrease in the number of
questions that our human students are
asking our human TAs. It is a good thing
in the sense that there was not that
many years ago that we couldn't keep up
with the volume of questions. And in my
early days of teaching CS50, I still
remember to this day the night or two
before a homework assignment was due,
sending out an email to the teaching
staff pleading pleading with people to
uh pluck off as many questions as they
could because it was simply overwhelming
for any one of us to answer all of those
questions. Now it's it's dare say
crickets uh on the discussion fora
because students are turning much more
frequently synchronously to a tool like
the duck uh which is a good thing I do
think in terms of immediia for help. It
is there is it is a two-edged sword and
that some students we know statistically
are probably asking too many questions.
I I don't claim to know exactly what the
right number of questions is to ask on a
particular problem or homework
assignment, but it's probably not 200 is
one of the outliers we've seen
statistically in the data. uh feels to
me like the right model is thinking back
to you know maybe high school class
where you'd raise your hand or go to the
front of the room and ask the teacher a
question and at some point even the best
of teachers is going to say David you
need to go back to your seat and start
to wrestle with this on your own think
about the problem for a bit more and
that's what we've tried to do with the
duck so indeed it actually has a
built-in throttling mechanism
implemented in the form of uh hearts or
HP kind of like a Zelda game uh whereby
those hearts uh diminish uh decrease
over the course of your usage and they
automatically do regenerate, but at a
rate that we think is is reasonable. Um,
we've also seen a market downturn in
attendance at physical office hours,
which are in-person opportunities for
one-on-one or small group help on
campus. That too has been a good thing
in the sense that those two we could not
keep up with during the heights of
popularity of office hours, even though
our ratio of students to TAS has really
been invariant over the years. Um
nowadays we have sometimes more TAs than
students at office hours because they
too were turning to the duck. Um that
said I'm not sure it was ever the best
use of students time to have to for
instance slog across campus get in a
seat raise their hand wait for help. So
I do think we've provided better
pedagogical support. That said a side
effect that is I think we do a worse job
at training our own TAs or our own
future teachers because there's just
fewer students for them to interact
with. fewer students with whom to
practice the art of teaching, fewer
questions that they get asked to think
through and then answer in an effective
way. So that's little different from
what I think is happening even in the
software industry where junior
developers are uh potentially being
replaced by AI and so it calls into
question well how do you train the
senior developers if you have this gap?
So that too is a very valid concern but
one that I think can be addressed by
just all the more education, all the
more training so that the humans are
progressing from u 0 to 60 um and
perhaps even passing that that junior
step in some sense. Well, uh, it's cool
that you bring up this new problem, I
guess, that nobody necess not very many
people would have anticipated that, oh,
like people are these these LMS are too
helpful, uh, to the extent that, uh,
we're just not getting the teacher
training that we used to get. Uh, being
a a teaching assistant, you just don't
have the same volume of interactions
with learners because they can go and,
uh, ask NLM and don't have to be
embarrassed by their their own
ignorance. And that affects me even at
my level. I sometimes I'm like, is this
a dumb question? You know, [laughter]
and they don't have to worry about that
because the LLM won't judge them. Uh,
and the LLM, they can just delete the
conversation and never pretend that they
didn't know how to properly pronounce
pedagogy, for example. That was one of
the question before. I read this word
all the time. Is it pedagogy or
pedigogy? You say it one more time.
>> I say pedagogy.
>> Okay, cool. Yeah. And uh I don't have a
background in Latin, I guess, or Greek.
Maybe Greek is probably where that word
comes from. Uh but uh I guess public
service announcement, don't be afraid to
ask dumb questions. Uh but you know,
asking an LLM a dumb question, nobody
ever knows that you didn't know that,
right? [laughter]
>> Indeed. And hopefully it's not making up
the answer. So
>> yeah. Yeah. Hopefully it's not making up
the answer. Uh that's that's never good.
Uh since you mentioned like the the rush
at the uh right before the homework
assignment is due, the rush right before
the exam where people are asking
questions, I wanted to talk about
academic honesty because you did publish
a paper about this uh and uh even at a
you know high level like Harvard we
think basically one of the best
universities in the world. It's very
hard to get into Harvard. There is
academic dishonesty even at that level.
There there are people that will given
like a whole lot of pressure uh they're
like oh man if I go just turn in what I
have I'm going to bomb and I'm
potentially not going to pass CS50 and
that's going to be reflected forever on
my university transcript. So people do
have an incentive to essentially commit
acts of academic dishonesty and I wanted
to talk about how uh you all have
approached this over the years. you've
experimented quite a bit and uh what
some of the problems are and what are
some of the solutions you've tried.
>> Yeah. And it's a good question and
something that we and so many other
teachers wrestle with. Um and it was
painful in my early years of teaching to
see students crossing these lines by
submitting work that wasn't their own
either by having someone else do it for
them or submitting work that had already
been submitted or nowadays of course
leveraging AI uh in ways they that they
should not according to the course's own
policy. Um I do think it happens for the
very reasons you allude to. Students uh
at all levels are under pressure whether
it's academic or personal or
professional. They meet uh they have
some deadline to meet. They might be
taking a course that they don't
necessarily want to take or don't
particularly care about. And so in that
sense it doesn't feel all that important
to worry about those lines. Um, at the
end of the day though, one of the things
we've tried to do in CS50 as best we can
though is to instill in students an
appreciation of just how important it is
for your work to reflect yourself. At
the end of the day, you're putting your
name on this and it should reflect your
work, ideally good quality work, but if
not, uh, better that it be poor work as
opposed to that of another. And so we
do, like many peer institutions and
introductory courses, cross-co compare
all submissions that students submit,
looking for statistically unlikely
similarities across submissions. And if
we humans then upon seeing the results
of that analysis by a computer decide,
yeah, this just didn't seem to happen by
chance, we then refer the matter in
Harvard's case to the administrative
board or the honor council where a
different group of people um then
adjudicate the matter formally. Um
typically we administratively discipline
therefore 5 to 10% of CS50 student body
on campus. This is unfortunately in line
with peer institutions. Um, a silver
lining I can say in all of this is that
even in the advent of AI, we CS50 on
campus at least have not seen an uptick
in misbehavior. Um, I don't doubt that
there are some instances of academic
dishonesty that we're not catching and
that we've never caught, although 5 to
10% is already a big chunk. Um, and I'd
like to think that the fact that we
haven't seen a market uptick in
inappropriate behavior in CS50 is
because we've spent the past 20 plus
years messaging to students just how
important it is to be mindful of these
issues and also providing them to the
extent we can with mechanisms for
dealing with that stress and that sense
of being overwhelmed or up against a
deadline. So some years back for
instance in CS50 we introduced what we
call regret clause which is some
language in the syllabus that
essentially prescribes what students
should do if they realize that they've
made a poor decision. Because I think
all too often in CS50 and in academia
more generally you might very well make
a poor decision under stress under no
sleep at like 2 a.m. in the morning and
it's only after you finally get some
sleep and give it some thought that you
actually regret what you did and in
hindsight perhaps would not have done
it. But typically in a class there's
just no mechanism to then solve that
problem after the fact. And so what we
proposed in CS50 syllabus a few years
ago that if students come forward to us
uh within 72 hours of having made a poor
decision, the 72 is somewhat arbitrary,
but it feels to us like a reasonable
amount of time for students certainly to
have gotten some sleep and done some
reflection by then that if they come
forward to us um it will not be without
consequences still. will still still
typically zero the homework or the um
assignment in question. Um but we will
not escalate the matter further which is
to say we won't refer it further up to
the administrative board or the honor
council. So there is a bound on just how
bad that outcome might be. But more
important, more importantly,
educationally is it gives students an
opportunity to own that mistake and to
the extent they can make it right. And
it clarifies a priori exactly how bad or
scary the consequences will be because I
wouldn't fault a student not knowing
what's going to happen if they just come
forward to an arbitrary class that
doesn't have a stated policy. It just
feels even scarier um in situations like
that. So we aspired to try to turn this
into a so-called teachable moment by
defining the parameters by which
students could come forward.
>> Yeah. And uh I am very proud and I will
brag about this. I've never committed
academic dishonesty knowingly throughout
my entire academic career uh going
through K through 12 going to university
and grad school. Uh, but I can imagine
if you did commit some act of academic
dishonesty, whether that was just having
GPT write your paper for you or uh, you
know, cheating on an exam or something
like that, like there is an a chance
you're not going to get caught and
there's going to be no negative
consequence. Uh, so you have to do kind
of like an evaluation of okay, if I get
caught, it's really bad, but uh, if I
come forward, I'm definitely going to
have negative consequences. Just those
negative consequences are going to be
less severe. Uh so it's the kind of like
uh inevitability versus severity
trade-off that uh people have to think
about. But at the end of the day, it's
the right thing to just admit like, hey,
I screwed up and and this, you know, one
error does not need to, you know,
>> I don't have to feel guilty about this
for my entire life, right?
>> I I can just say what happened. And I
think it's so cool that you have that
clause. And I'm certainly uh we have
lots of people in the free code camp
community who come forward and they're
like you know what I did use an LLM to
write this code block for me and I
should have written it myself. I know
that I shouldn't have and uh then we're
like cool we've erased the challenge
just do it again. Uh and I I think like
actually adding some sort of regret
clause to pre-cooking because often we
have to strip people of their
certifications and stuff like that when
we detect these things. We do detect
these things. It happens a lot,
especially when you're outside of like
an academic setting. Like, nobody's
going to know that I just cheated my way
to getting this certification that I can
add to my LinkedIn. Uh, but I I think
it's a really cool clause. You also had
like something called a brink clause if
you can tell just I know that's no
longer something that you use, but just
in case people and I guess why you no
longer use that. Yeah, it was inspired
by a colleague Christopher Moretti at
Princeton who had a similar clause in
his syllabus. And the brink clause was
worded in such a way as to convey to
students that if you're bumping up a g a
deadline, which might be midnight for
instance in our case, and you're
genuinely concerned that you are on that
brink of making a poor decision,
grabbing a solution from the internet,
having a friend do it for you nowadays,
having AI do it for you. Um, you know
what? email us, explain your situation,
go to sleep, and we'll deal with it in
the morning, thereby giving you a bit of
extra time to work through it. Um, it
was a wonderful idea in spirit. The
intent was to be sort of a counterpart
to the regret clause to try to preempt
the poor decision by giving students an
out before they make that decision. In
practice, we felt that it was just
abused significantly in the sense that a
significant a number we felt was
significant of students were invoking
the bring clause right before the
deadline. And we did not, it was not our
impression from the the content and tone
of these emails that students were
indeed on the brink of making a a poor
decision with respect to academic
honesty, but rather that they hadn't
budgeted time correctly and they wanted
an out from the deadline, not from a
future bad act. And so it just wasn't
working as it was intended. And we felt
that um the regret clause educationally
was serving a better goal. And so we
eliminated the bring clause shortly
thereafter.
>> Awesome. And I really appreciate you
going into that uh experiment because a
lot of teachers might hear about those
sorts of things and that's anecdotal
evidence that people aren't necessarily
going to use it the way you intend. Uh
but it does sound like the regret clause
is working. Uh and you all intend to
continue to have that clause going
forward.
>> We do. Yep. And since we're talking
about academic dishonesty and academic
honesty, I did want to ask about
traditional A throughF letter grades and
whether you think those are potentially
deterring people from taking harder
classes like CS50 uh that would expand
their brain but potentially be a lot
harder than a lot of other electives
they might be able to take. What are
your thoughts on pass fail versus A
throughF grading skills and uh what have
what experimentation have you done in
that area?
>> Yeah, I think that risk is absolutely
possible in the students minds if they
takes a course that's too challenging
for them, too difficult, too much work
that they might indeed therefore hurt
their GPA and so they're not pursuing
areas of potential interest to them
academically for what I think many
teachers would argue is the wrong
reasons, the grading outcome. Um and
more generally with something like
computer science which has generally in
many students minds been a field to
beware in so far as they might think
themselves not computer people um we
have tried to attack that head-on in
CS50 and so at least on campus we have
long evangelized students taking the
course sat unsat satisfactory
unsatisfactory so to speak which is
essentially functionally equivalent to
what most people know as pass fail
whereby students simply have to meet a
certain threshold to be satisfactorily
graded in the course or unsatisfactorily
graded. It's it's binary, not uh
inappropriate for a computer science
course. The motivation though for us
within CS50 specifically is to been to
create an environment in which students
do not need to fear failure so to speak
even if failure is a B or a C or an
actual F. Um but rather they can feel
all the more empowered to explore uh
uncomfortable waters, less familiar
waters for them, particularly if they've
never studied something like computer
science or programming specifically. uh
within CS50 itself on campus about 30%
of students do now elect this sat onset
option it's not nearly as high as I
would like if I had my way the entire
course would be graded this way but
unfortunately there are other
departments on campus that require that
students take letter grades even in
their computer science course if they
want to get departmental credit in
another course so there's always been
some downward pressure there as a result
but online and at scale all of CS50's
courses via open courseware are
effectively graded un sat on in so far
as to receive a certificate students uh
need to receive a 70% or higher on all
of their work, which is consistent with
the line we draw on campus for SAT.
>> I'm a huge fan of Harvard and its work
in open educational resources. For
example, uh making a lot of massive open
online courses like CS50 available
through its partnership with MIT and
edex. uh and just in general I'm a fan
of CS50 and of you for taking so much of
your teaching and making it publicly
available to everyone to millions of
people around the world who want to
learn uh security who want to learn uh
CS fundamentals want to learn gamedev
from a Harvard professor uh I think it's
really really cool but I have to
acknowledge that even with uh everything
that Harvard's doing there is still
probably a gap between what is real and
what is potentially possible. Can you
talk about the gap there and like if you
could wave a magic wand how you would
change higher education in the US?
>> Wow, it's a tall order. Um so among my
recurring frustrations is the sort of
temporal structure of university
education and even high school and
earlier in the United States whereby in
the high school level at a place like
Harvard students are generally taking
four sometimes five classes at a time
and they're therefore multipplexing
among them over the course of a
semester. Like that's a lot of different
things to be spending time on and it's
to the exclusion of I think being able
to have a truly immersive academic
experience in the course. Um, by
contrast, for instance, a course I've
taught for years, uh, at Harvard Law
School is computer science for lawyers
or CS50 for lawyers. The structure for
which is wonderful because it fits into
what the law school calls their winter
session where is a three-week period
whereby the graduate students have an
opportunity to take one and only one
class immersively. And I dare say it is
among the most engaged, most committed
student audiences that I think we tend
to have over the course of a year
because they have so much less uh going
on during that same session. Uh this
allows us to have c for instance morning
lectures and then afternoon hands-on
labs and then to do it again the next
day and the next day and the next day.
And even though admittedly certainly
with something like programming I think
having some time for the material and
for yourself to breathe is important
certainly when it comes to certain
conceptual concepts certain hands-on
laboratories being able to do something
like that very immersively I think is
incredibly valuable. So for my part I
would much prefer to see the university
structure invol uh be that students take
one course at a time maybe two courses
just to give you a bit of variety and to
give you the opportunity to take a break
from one thing but three courses four
courses. I think back to high school,
seven different courses I was taking,
for instance, at any one time, one of
which might have been recess admittedly,
but that's a lot to sort of juggle all
at the same time and to distract oneself
with. So, I think structurally we can do
better. Um, and it's also, I think, the
traditional schedule that I think does
us a disservice. And I've been
increasingly feeling that students are
in a much better position taking a
course like CS50 online than they are by
physically coming to at least the
lectures in person in Sanders Theater.
And this is true for the undergraduates
who are not coming and are indeed
watching the lectures online and for our
many online students who are taking the
course via open courseware and platforms
like edex. If for the simplest of
reasons they can pause and fast forward
and rewind when something gets a little
bit confusing, they can go down the
rabbit hole of trying some code on their
computer or looking something up online.
And that is a lot harder, if not
impossible, to do synchronously when
you're in the lecture hall physically
with me for two hours and 45 minutes
because all of us zone out one or more
times during uh the day, let alone
during a class. And it's certainly not
to your educational benefit if that
completely derails you for the rest of
lecture just because you missed some
simple but important topic um just for
having zoned out. So I think leveraging
technology in a way that is a solution
to these temporal problems is just
significantly underappreciated by
traditional uh residential campuses um
at at all levels at least here in the
US.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So essentially making
education more convenient and also just
stripping out like the the time and
place uh to an extent so that people can
so so that they can fit people have to
petrist their lives around and
university not like non-traditional
learners if you're going to night school
if you're already working. Uh it can be
a huge burden to have to report to a
specific location at a specific time to
learn. And then there as you said the
fundamental restriction of you can't
pause of a live lecture. uh you can't
get up to go to the bathroom and not
miss something. You can't rewind to
rehear something like when I did this
your CS50 uh security course which you
taught which free co recently published.
Uh I just listened to it. Uh I I would
pull out my phone whenever there was
some sort of visual element that I
needed to see to fully understand. But a
lot of it I could just be uh you know
doing the dishes, taking my kids to
school and uh I could progress through
that over the course of maybe like seven
or eight different discrete se uh
sessions of learning. And granted, I
didn't do the labs or anything. I just
listened to the lectures, but I could
listen to them at double speed and I
could scrub back and relisten to a part
where I felt like I didn't fully
understand what was said. And these are
things that you just can't do in a
real-time uh lecture. So,
>> no. when we have a solution to this
problem and just so few schools are
embracing it for what it is good at I do
think.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. So sounds like
that's one of the biggest value unlocks
for an institution is to potentially
follow in your footsteps in terms of
recording the lectures and making them
publicly available so people can consume
them kind of at their convenience. Uh
are there any other like fast quicks uh
fixes that you think could dramatically
help universities and university
students?
>> You know that too is a loaded question.
Quick fix. I don't know. But I will say
another thing that's top of mind is
outside of the US. We were recently in
the United Kingdom for instance for a
CS50 puzzle day and a CS50 hackathon.
And they in higher education have a
somewhat different system in which
students generally have to know what
they are going to study before they get
to university. And I have long felt well
how do they even know what they want to
study at that level if they haven't even
been exposed to all possible subjects in
K12 which is surely not generally
possible. And so there too, I think we
should be rethinking what students
trajectory is from the youngest of ages
to the oldest of ages while still in
school. So that everyone does have a
genuine opportunity to find their way in
terms of their passion, in terms of
their expertise, um, and to really set
them up for success in ways that I don't
think the structure in the US and beyond
necessarily does right now.
>> Yeah. And, uh, I'm not one of those
people that thinks, oh, Europe's got it
all figured out. like but taking the
general ed requirement and like kind of
pushing it down into high school or even
earlier uh so that people get exposed to
more subject domain areas before they
have to make the decision. And in the US
I guess the big constraint is once you
get to a university it becomes like
costly in terms of money like if you
have to do like a fifth year of school
because you weren't able to decide on a
major or you weren't able to get all the
classes lined up. uh that can provide a
lot of disincentive. Like I I talk to
people all the time that are almost done
with a major in like nursing and they're
like, ""Well, I'm almost done and I'm
just going to get this nursing degree
and I I don't have time to switch to CS
and get all the requirements. It's going
to cost me a fortune. I'm going to go
even further into debt."" So, there are
practical realities to that as well. Uh
at least the European system, like if
you don't get to change, you don't have
to worry about that kind of a situation
emerging because you're already locked
in. Uh but that's not optimal either,
right?
>> No. And here too, technology offers us a
partial solution here. Even if a school
is not so fortunate as to have all of
the teachers that it needs, all for all
the courses that it wants. Well, other
institutions can offer the same and we
can lean on each other and pull
collective resources so that a student
at one school can take a course somehow
technologically from a school elsewhere.
And I think we do too little of this
right now.
>> Yeah. Well, I have a ton of questions
for you coming from the developer
community. I tweeted out that I was
going to talk with you, and I've never
done this before, but I may do it more
frequently, but of course, everybody
knows who you are, and they had lots of
questions for you. So, we're just going
to do a rapid fire uh question and
answer round. Uh, and I want to start
with a question from my Vong. Uh, she
asks, ""Which CS50 course is your
favorite to teach?"" Oh, I think I have
to say I love them all equally, but in
so far as we teach CS50, aka CS50X, live
every fall and continue to evolve it the
most, that's probably my favorite, if
only because it's the course that I
myself took uh and the one that provides
a gateway to so many of our other
courses now.
>> Yeah. And a question from Kyle Furchin.
He asks, ""How will CS50 adapt its
curriculum going forward?"" I think in
light of AI is the context there.
>> Yeah, if if that's the implied question,
not fundamentally, honestly. I think AI,
at least for us, is a wonderful new
resource for students and for teachers
alike to help them master material
without having a subject matter expert
by their side in their family, in their
social circle. we can now provide in the
form of the duck for instance the
equivalent the near equivalent of a
virtual TA to every student out there
that I think is gamechanging and I think
we'll continue to invest and to focus on
how that duck or its future form can
continue to support students. I don't
think that curricularly I don't think
that structurally we intend to change
the courses all that much because I'd
like to think that we've long focused
truly on the fundamentals that we feel
students should master with or without
AI and in so far as most of CS50's
courses are introductory in nature that
foundation is rather invariant across
the courses
>> and I'll just opine here that's
precisely how I view free code camp's
core curriculum uh we're not
fundamentally changing anything because
we're focusing on fundamentals And
fundamentals haven't fundamentally
changed. It's just that tools for
understanding and reasoning about those
fundamentals. Uh we have additional
arrows in the quiver, right? Uh
additional tools in the toolbox.
>> Uh what what's your workflow for
producing these courses? I don't know if
you can go through like just the general
production because they are very
polished.
>> Well, thank you. There's a whole team
off camera behind me and behind the
scenes that makes that all possible. Uh,
back in the day when I first started
teaching CS50 in 2007, I think we were a
single camera shot. And if you wanted to
see what was going on on the slides over
my head, we would just take the Sony
camcorder and just point it up here for
a few seconds and then back down here
wreaking havoc with the iris and the
lighting settings in in fact. But, uh,
it was still usable and we made even
that content available online early on.
Nowadays, I work with a whole team of
talented artists who operate as many as
five cameras at once. Uh, some of them
are now robotically controlled just to
give us beautiful shots back and forth
on the stage. One of which is always
locked off on our green screen which we
tuck off into the corner of the stage so
that you can actually see the code
composited behind me uh as large as
possible. Um, we then after capturing
the live assets which we do live stream
in raw form uh we then go back to the
drawing board and edit everything. So we
have an internal process where one or
more of the team members will take
charge of editing all of the footage
from those five cameras together even
though we do have a live cut with which
we might begin uh go we then have two QA
processes whereby a member of the staff
watches and reviews the content again
and again both for technical accuracy
and uh and academic accuracy. On
occasion, uh, we'll go back into Sanders
before, for instance, the next class and
shoot a bunch of audio pickups if I
misspoke or said something wrong or or,
uh, incomprehensible. Uh, or sometimes
video segments if either I did something
completely wrong or we ran out of time
or I don't like how something came out,
we might do those edits. Um, but it's a
very time consuming process and we try
to optimize ultimately for what the
student experience is, especially since
these courses in in our practice at
least tend to have a long shelf life of
at least a year if not two or three or
four or more years nowadays. So, we'd
like to get them just right.
>> Yeah. And shout out uh to the person who
asked that question by the way, Rulo
Aruda. The next question comes from Aul
uh who asked what advice do you have for
picking strong projects to build?
>> Oh,
I have myself chosen projects that are
just solutions to problems that I myself
have in my life and nowadays they're
almost always connected to CS50 or
teaching more broadly in some way. In
fact, I really enjoy working on some of
CSS's web-based tools and command line
tools because I know they have an
audience and there are tools I think
should exist. And so if I or we don't
make them, they just won't. And so
that's sort of intrinsically motivating
for me. Very early on when I was sort of
finding my way and learning computer
science and programming specifically, I
set out even then to solve a problem of
interest to me or at least people in my
world. So when I was a sophomore or
junior at Harvard, after having taken
CS50 and one other class in which I
learned a bit of C++, I set out to
create what was called Shuttle Boy,
which was a uh Unixbased program written
in C or C++ that simply let students
look up the next time and location that
a shuttle bus would arrive. Back in the
day, we only had printed uh sheets of
paper. Uh there was no GPS, there were
no smartphones. Uh and so the best we
could do is evolve it to something
digital. So if you, you know, went over
to the computer kiosk in the nearby
building, you could check the schedule
and then run outside to actually catch
the shuttle bus over time that evolved
into an instant messaging bot. Over
time, Harvard took it sort of back over
and had uh GPS added to the mix. But for
me, that was so wonderfully exciting as
an undergraduate having hundreds, maybe
even at the peak thousands of my
classmates actually using a piece of
software I wrote. So finding something
that you care about and better still
other people care about I think is the
best way to really uh immerse yourself
and learn more about code.
>> Awesome. So finding something you care
about that other people care about and
building something that people are going
to use and of course once you have
people using it you have a feedback loop
and it becomes very uh clear what kind
of improvements you need to make so you
can just continue to uh maintain that
project. Excellent advice. And then uh
we have a question from Nevin who asks,
""What tips do you have to self-taught
developers to make the process for
preparing for work as a developer as
short as possible?""
>> I'm not sure that should be the goal to
make it as short as possible. I
completely understand the motivation and
the opportunity cost of sort of spending
time educating yourself or preparing in
this case for a job. But I think the
reality is a lot of mastery just comes
with time and with practice. And I think
it's probably the wrong mindset, perhaps
an unhealthy mindset to go into
something trying to rush it or at least
to minimize that amount of time. I think
what you the probably a better way to
frame it is how do I maximize the value
of my time? So whatever unit of time I'm
actually putting into preparation or
learning something that I'm getting the
most out of it. And through the lens of
CS50 for instance, this is just one of
the reasons why CS50 itself is fairly
intensive and has such a large syllabus.
This amalgam of what other places tend
to call CS1 and CS2 because at least on
campus in a traditional environment,
we've only ever had our students with us
for some 12 weeks. So 3 months and so if
that's the variable that's constrained,
we want to optimize for what we can
achieve in those 12 weeks. So I think
that's probably the better way to frame
things as opposed to how you minimize uh
the denominator for instance.
>> Awesome. And one question I have for
you, how do you remember the names of
all your students? Uh I frequently hear
when you're answering questions from the
audience offscreen in your courses,
you'll address the student by name. And
you are sitting in the region theater
which is huge. You've got tons of seats.
Uh and you often record in other
theaters as well, right? Um and so like
imagine a class of potentially hundreds
of learners there. Like how do you keep
track of all those names? Do you have
any advice to people for remembering
people's names?
>> I admittedly don't. I don't remember the
hundreds of names that are there. But I
certainly over the course of a semester
on campus get to know uh some of the
students typically those who are the
most participatory in class. We also
have a tradition of bringing students to
lunch at a nearby restaurant most
Fridays during the term. The the
motivation for which is to help a big
class feel small and to actually meet
students wearing literally not just uh
hello my name is name tags but hello
world my name is name tags and that
helps ingrain some of them in me. I get
to know our teaching fellows quite well
on campus over time. Certainly those who
TA for us again and again. Um and then
when students come up onto stage uh if
I've not met them before that's the
moment to meet them, get to know a
little something about them. Uh at which
point they then tend to stick in mind
thereafter as well.
>> Final question. You have said get
comfortable being uncomfortable.
Can you elaborate on this for people who
are about to take the plunge and learn
something as potentially daunting as
computer science and programming?
Yeah, at least in the context of
computer science and programming, it's
just such a vast space already and it's
only getting larger and larger with more
and more advancements and technologies
and products out there that I don't
think you'll ever feel comfortable in it
because there's always going to be
something you don't yet know because it
only came out like the day before. And
this is true certainly for teaching.
Anytime I take on a new course, it's
incredibly uncomfortable because I don't
know what the students are going to ask
me and I don't want to look like an
idiot and not being able to answer their
question correctly. And even in an
interview like this, sort of being on
edge, not knowing quite where the
conversation is going to go. But I think
there's therefore value in just
embracing the fact, okay, I'm about to
do something, whether it's learning
something, teaching something,
interviewing with someone, that I will
be uncomfortable. also to just kind of
own that and to get comfortable being in
that space and not letting the
proverbial butterflies for instance get
the best of you. I mean, to this day, 19
years into teaching CS50, I'm still
nervous going into the very first class.
And admittedly, I'm not as nervous as I
originally was. The very first or second
year I taught CS50, I still remember
iPods did exist at the time already, and
I was trying to turn on some music just
to play as walk-in music as students
entered the class. and I couldn't
operate the iPod that day because my
hands were so sweaty the screen would
not respond. So for me that's sort of
the pinnacle of like nervousness and I
have throttled that back enough so that
I'm still nervous. I'm still
uncomfortable but I'm much more
comfortable now because I know it's not
going to be the end of the world. I know
that 5 seconds into class beginning I'm
going to finally feel at ease. Those
butterflies are going to dissipate. And
so through practice and through time,
I've just gotten myself comfortable
being uncomfortable just as we encourage
our own students when stepping foot in
the classroom for the first time
themselves.
>> Well, David, thank you for, you know,
sharing that vulnerability. Uh just the
discomfort doesn't completely go away,
but it does dissipate a little bit and
then uh you can feel confident that once
you get started, you're going to lock in
and you're going to be able to perform.
And I think that's advice uh listeners
can take to heart. I really appreciate
everything you're doing through CS50. I
appreciate the fact that you're making
so many of these courses like C uh
Creative Commons licensed and just
making them free and open for everyone.
I encourage everybody tuning in to watch
some of the CS50 lectures and
potentially even participate and do all
the assignments that are available and
things like that. Uh and I really
appreciate you making time out of your
busy day to answer my many questions and
these questions from the community.
Thanks again for everything you're
doing. Thank you for having me."

G9JxuWk7BDA,Discrete Mathematics Course for Beginners,"Learn discrete mathematics in this beginner's course. Discrete mathematics plays a key role in IT solutions, used in machine learning, accelerating queries in search engines and databases, in algorithms such as finding the shortest paths (graph theory), encryption, compression, and many other modern systems/solutions.

This field is constantly evolving along with the development of its key application: computer science. This course is an introduction to this group of mathematical sciences, and we will focus on the most important issues on which other branches of discrete mathematics are based: combinatorics, number theory, prime numbers, and several selected topics: pigeonhole principle, stars and bars principle, Stirling's number, and the Chinese remainder theorem. At the end of the course, there are tips and encouragement for further exploration of this field.

Karol Kurek teaches this course. He is a former math teacher and senior Python developer.

this group of mathematical sciences and
it focuses on the most important topics
related to discrete mathematics,
combinotaurics, number theory, prime
numbers. You'll also learn about the
pigeon hole principle, the stars and
bars principle, Sterling's number, and

Kurrick developed this course.
>> Welcome to the course on discrete
mathematics. In this course, we will
cover only a portion of this field or
rather this collection of mathematical
fields because discrete mathematics as a
whole is simply too vast. On the
beginning, let's say what is discrete
mathematics? It is a field or as
mentioned even a collection of fields
that focuses on the study of structures
and objects that can be counted meaning
those that are equinian numerous with
the set of natural numbers. In the other
words 1 2 3 4 5 objects we can count
them right even if there are infinity
many. So we are concerned with things we
can count like the number of swimming
pools not with continuously varying
quantities like the amount of water in
each pool as it fills up which could be
any positive real number. So we study
structures that are countable either
finite where we can simply give the
number of elements or infinite but still
countable in the sense of having a
onetoone correspondence with the natural
numbers. Natural numbers are just the
start. Integers and even rational
numbers are also countable. And in fact,
there are just as many rational numbers
as there are natural numbers. We will
explore that idea later. And this is
exactly where discrete mathematics comes
in. Focusing solely on the stepwise
structures. Take for example a sequence
of events like rolling a dieice. You
have the first roll, second roll, third
roll, fourth roll, and so on. There's no
such thing as a pi roll or a square root
of two roll. We don't even consider half
a roll. No fractional steps here, right?
So we can count those roles. As I said
earlier, discrete mathematics is
essentially a collection of branches of
mathematics or a subset of other
mathematical fields branches because
some areas of mathematics deals with
both countable and uncountable
structures. Discrete mathematics focuses
exclusively on the countable ones. Here
are just a few examples of fields that
fall under discrete mathematics. Graph
theory, number theory, mathematical
logic, linear programming. Note here,
despite the name, this is not directly
related to computer programming. Linear
programming is a branch of mathematics
that studies optimization problems
involving linear equations and
inequalities. So no it's not connected
with programming cryptography combinics.
In this course we will focus primarily
on combinotaics and selected topics of
number theory. We'll mention maybe some
other fields as well. Let's illustrate
this even more with some real world
examples. Imagine planning a trip to the
city. You have several cities to visit.
And each route has a cost. Cost in terms
of time, money or fuel. You want to
optimize your route. The number of
cities is usually finite and often quite
small, right? And discrete mathematics
provides the tools to analyze such
problems. Or think of digital photos on
your phone or in the cloud. A photo is
just a collection of pixels and each
pixel has a specific color from a
limited set. Discrete mathematics helps
us model such data, compress it and
analyze its structure, store it in
various formats, convert it between
formats. All of this involves massive
amounts of data and discrete mathematics
plays a key role in making it
manageable. Of course, this also applies
to processing audio, videos, texts, and
other structured data which are
typically finite and discrete in nature.
Another important example is
cryptography. Encrypted messages often
rely on prime numbers and discrete
mathematics is fundamental here both in
finding large primes and in designing
encryption algorithms that keep our data
secure. Protect it as it is written from
unauthorized access. So the applications
of discrete mathematics are everywhere
from data encryption through network
design all the way even to artificial
intelligence. To understand, to
summarize, discrete mathematics is the
study of step-by-step processes and
countable structures. It includes not
only combinatorics and number theory,
which will be our main focus here, but
also graph theory, cryptography, logic
algorithms, and more. Thanks to these
tools, we can model, analyze, and solve
real world problems, which is exactly
what we will try to do throughout this
course. Let's get started.
Welcome. Our first topic in discrete
mathematics will be permutations.
There are two main ways to understand
permutations. They are quite similar.
First, a permutation can be seen as any
rearrangement of the elements of a set.
For example, if you have the set AB,
then AB and BA are two different
permutations. both include the same
elements just in a different order.
Alternatively, we can think of a
permutation as a function or more
precisely a mapping. We won't go into
the formalities here that performs this
rearrangement.
Now in the first interpretation, if we
take the set 1 2 3, then its
permutations are 1 2 3 1 3 2 21 2 3 2 3
1 3 1 2 and 3 2 1. So there are six in
total permutations.
This means that in a permutation no
elements can be lost. If something is
present in the original set, it must
also appear in the result. In the second
interpretation, we think of a
permutation as a function that for a set
like ABC returns a new arrangement say
ACB swapping the second and third
elements.
second goes to third B and third goes to
second C.
So in this sense when we say permutation
we might actually be referring to a
permuting function. For example one that
transforms 1 2 3 into 1 32 by swapping
two and three. Yeah, this is what
function does. Swapping those two
elements. Such a function is commonly
written in Kosh's twoline notation where
we indicate that first element goes to
first, second element goes to third one
and third one goes to second or first
maps to first, second maps to third,
third maps to second.
You will notice something interesting
here. If we apply this per notation
twice, we start with 1 2 3
Then get one free tool
and then applying the same swap again
second and third element
we return to the original arrangement
1 2 3
we'll talk about this soon it's an
example of a cycle now if as in our case
the elements of the set x are numbers
here 1 2 3 we can write the mapping more
simply one maps to one two maps to three
maps to two
sometimes this kind of notation is also
used even when the set elements aren't
numbers in that case we treat the
numbers as indices as indexes quite
simple idea right yes they are simple
even though
a relatively simple concept they do have
real applications and are used to solve
interesting problems. One of them which
we'll implement is an algorithm that
generates all possible permutations of a
given set. Password cracking if a
password is rearranging of known
characters and an attacker may try all
permutation to guess it. A brute force
approach directly tied to combinatory.
This is why a longer password is safer.
The traveling sailors men problem. This
classic problem involves finding the
shortest possible route that visits a
list of cities and returns to the
starting point. And it's all about
evaluating permutations of cities.
Imagine you have seven cities and
traveling from city A to B has a certain
cost. From B to C has another cost and
so on. Every connection between the
cities has some associated cost. The
goal is to visit all seven cities while
paying as little as possible. For
example, in terms of fuel or money spent
on travel. The cost can be this paying
thing can be for example time.
Encryption algorithms like DS. Some
encryption methods like the data
encryption system rely on specific
permutations of bits or byes as part of
the process to obscure data. It is a
relatively old encryption algorithm. But
it's had many successes that continue to
use permutation as part of the encoding
process. This is a math problem. An
interesting math problem is counting the
number of possible car cycles in
permutations of n elements. And that
leads to interesting counting problems.
To move forward, we first need to
understand a few important things. The
first one being what exactly is a cycle
in a permutation. A cycle is any
permutation of the follow. similar to
this. So a cycle is a permutation where
the elements return to their original
positions after a certain number of
steps. Here one maps to three and three
maps to one. After applying the
permutation twice the elements go back
to where they started. One will be one
and and three will be three. Similarly
two maps to four, four maps to five,
five to two. We can see that here that
the spotation consists of two disjint
cycles. One cycle has length two and the
other has length three. We can write
this permutation in cycle notation. So
here one goes to three, three goes to
one. Here two goes to four, four to five
and five back to two. And we can convert
between this cycle form and the two line
koshi notation both describe the same
permutation the same cycles. Every
permutation consists of at least one
cycle. Sometimes the entire permutation
is a single long cycle such as one maps
to two, two maps to three, three to
four, four to five, five to one. Right?
Then the whole permutation is a cycle.
In other cases, we might have a fixed
point per mutation, meaning nothing
changes. One maps to one, two maps to
two, 3 to 3, 4 to 4, 5 to 5. In that
case, we technically have five one
element cycles. As we said, a
permutation with no smaller cycles, that
is one that moves all elements in a
single closed loop, is itself a single
cycle. The second topic is a permutation
of a multis set, not here for
non-English students like myself. In
other languages, it is often a
permutation with repetition. But in
English, permutation with repetition is
something different. Okay? So, up until
now, we've worked with elements like 1 2
3 4 5 no repetitions. But if elements
can repeat like in a list 1 2 3 4, we
are dealing with permutation
of a multis set. For example, in a word
barbarian, many rearrangements will
produce the same the exact same word
barbarian. Like swapping the first B in
barbarian with the second B on fourth
place results the same rearrangement.
The result still barbarian. So they are
not unique permutations.
what we were working so far. Penotations
with no repeat elements. They are
regular perotations or we call them
permutations of a set not a multi set or
simply permutations without repetition.
Now the key question is how many
permutations are there? We saw earlier
that for three element set X ABC there
are exactly six permutations. So for a
setup of n distinct elements the number
of the permutations is n factorial.
This leads factorial. Well factorial
means multiply
compute product of all numbers from 1 to
the given one. If n= 1 it is just 1. If
n= 2 then 1 * 2 is 2. If n= 3 then it is
1 * 2 * 3. six. So for permutations of a
multis set like in a world barbarian,
the formula for counting unique
permutations is n factorial divided by
n1 factorial * n2 factorial*
n k factorial
where n1 n2 and k are the frequencies of
each repeated element and k is the
number of using elements. So for the
word barbarian, B appears two times. The
letter A appears three times. R appears
two times. We will see that in a moment.
Let's look at some examples.
Example is a word disk. The word disk
has no repeated letters. So the number
of permutations is 24. 1 * 2 * 3 * 4.
And here we've listed all 24 possible
arrangements. Of course, most of them
are not words in a sense that they have
no meanings, but they are still
arrangements, right? On the other hand,
for the word papaya where P appears two
times, A appears three times, we have 60
possible arrangements
because 6 factorials is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 *
5 * 6, which is 720.
2 factorial is 2, 3 factorial is 6. 2 *
6 is 12.
and uh 720 divided by 12 is 60. So 60
ways and we have all of them here. And
there are 15,120
rearrangements of the word barbarian.
We won't list them all here, at least
not now, but we could write a plug to do
that later. But we can compute why
15,120.
So letters are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 in
total. So in numerator we have 9
factorial 9 factorial divided by in the
denominator we have
b and b is twice so two factorial.
A appears three times 3 factorial. R
appears twice. So two factorial
uh I and N
appears
once 1 factorial 1 factorial we don't
need to put one factorials but when we
put all those numbers 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1
should be 9 and so it is then we know
that we have checked all the objects
9 factorial Here we try to compute this
1 2 * 2 * 3
4 here
5 6 7 8 9
two factorial
3 factorial
2 factorial
and that's it. 1 factorial is one. Yeah.
And multiplying by one changes nothing.
1 * 2 * 3 cancels out.
1 * 2 1 * 2 is 4. So this cancels out.
And this is 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 * 9. It's
always an integer. Factorials are all
integers. So it equals 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 *
9.
Multiplication is commutative. So we can
multiply in any order we like. I for
instance want to multiply five with 6
and 7. So it is 30 * 7 210.
8 * 9 is 72.
And it equals we can check it
72
all without zero.
72 * 21 is 72
4
it is two
one one more five one. So it is 1 512
and zero.
So yes, there are 15,120
ways to rearrange the letters of
barbarian without creating duplicate
results. Okay, in the next lesson we
will try implementing something related
to permutations in code. See you there.
Welcome to work with permutations in
Python. All we need to do is import
permutations from the iterator tools
module. So we write from it tools import
permutations.
And that's basically it. We are ready to
start using permutations. But if we
simply call permutations like print
permutations for example using word disk
where all the letters are different and
we run it. We see that we got it to do.
Notations object at some place in
memory. What we actually get is an
iterator meaning we can iterate over it
to retrieve the elements one by one. Let
me mention right away we won't be using
an advanced Python features in this
course. So even if you are more familiar
with our different programming language,
you should be able to follow along just
fine. So we have an iterator but we
don't yet see the actual elements. If
you want to get the permutation as a
list, we need to convert it to a list.
We need convert this permutation iter
iterator
to list
and we run it here. Yes, we have disk
dsic
and so on. It should be 24 but it's not
the perfect way of displaying it. There
are tpples of characters not full
strings right. So let's join the
characters in each taple to form proper
strings. We can do this using a list
comprehension.
So we can put a list here
dot join
not this but
x
or x in. Okay. So uh x will be
every of those tpples and we will join
it to one simple string. You can see it
and we have it. We can assign it to a
variable let's say disk per term.
All these pairs
we can print them
and print the length of uh the list this
pairs
and it should be 24 right
24.
Next we can do the same thing with the
word barbarian.
So we change here to barbarian
run it
and there are 362,000
annotations.
Notice that some characters repeat and
as a result we get
many times the same word
here. N A I B A A B R. It's the same
here. Right?
We got monetized barbarian.
It shouldn't be dis
because it it is not disk right now.
If you want only the unique
permutations, we need to convert the
list to a set. We can do it by putting
set here or just using
set comprehension the same way as this
comprehension.
And then we should get our 15,120
permutations.
A quick warning here. The number of
permutations grows very fast as the
length of the input increases. This is
because the factorial function grows
very quickly. You can import factorial
from the math module. So math import
factorial
and let's see print factorial of 9.
It is our 362,000
as we had for B version when it was list
comprehension when we when we had
duplications.
And when we do I I put a ctrl D to
repeat the line.
When we put 12 instead of 9, we will see
that there is 479
millions permutations.
So the result is enormous and generating
all those permutations would take a very
long time. For example, if we try to
generate all permutations of A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, J, I, and J. If I'm reading it
correctly,
8 9 10. It will take some time.
Now we can see it. When we add another
letter,
it can take a lot of time. Maybe it will
not finish it during our life. No, maybe
it is. But but it will will take a lot
of time. Okay, we can stop it. So if you
only want to know how many permutations
there are, not generate all of them,
it's better to compute the count using
the factorial function instead of
generating all permutations and
converting them to a list or the set
what takes a lot of time.
And if you want to count the number of
permutations with repeated elements like
for barbarian,
we should write a custom function for
that.
Let's go ahead and create such a
function. We can call it how many
permutations. How many permutations
will pass an input for example the
string. It can be any iterable
collection but for us it will be string
and it will turn an integer.
Now the first thing we need to do is
figure out how many times each element
appears. Right? How do we do that? Uh
the easiest way in Python maybe pass
here is to use default dict collection
model. So collections
input default dict
with default dict we don't need to check
manually whether the key already exists
or not. Maybe let's see that normally we
would like do something like that. We
have barbarian. So we go with B.
We assign that B occured the first time
the same with A with the same with R but
now with B it occured previously. So now
we only increment the value add one.
Yeah. So it is twice. Now let's uh
program both versions. So normally
we create a regular dictionary called
letters.
And now for letter for each letter in
text. If
this letter was already in the
dictionary in letters if letter in
letters
then we add
one because it will again but in other
case we need to assign one because it is
not in our dictionary yet. Okay.
Now to calculate the number of
permutations permutations of a multi set
where elements repeat we compute
numerator it equals simply to n
factorial numerator
factorial of n regardless of that if it
is a permutation with or without
repeated elements. Uh n is the length of
text. So len of text.
Now when it comes to denominator
you remember from the presentation right
it's the product of the factorials of
the counts of each repeated element. If
we are dealing with uh perutations
without repetitions like this it is 1 *
1 * 1 * 1. So we are just multiplying
several copies of one factorial. The
product is still just one. This means
that denominator doesn't actually change
the result.
So it will work for permutations of set
or multi set as well for both of them.
Okay, the denominator is not this. Well,
it's actually not going to be that
simple. We first need to calculate the
factorial of the number of occurrences
of each element.
So
for the letter in letters
we need to compute factorial of how many
times it appears in text.
Factorial of
letters
of this letter. This is one way or we
can add here count
go by letter do items and use
count here
we don't really use letters or even we
can go by values
okay and those are just factors.
Now the denominator is product of all
those factors. So on the beginning this
one
for factor
in factors
we multiply the denominator. Denominator
multiply by current factor. Now we have
the denominator.
Finally we return that value of
numerator divided by denominator.
We can check if this code works. So
we know this maybe we can
comment this out it should be 15,120.
So instead of doing that or after doing
that we can call
how many perpetations in the word
barbarian
and it is 15,120.
And now if we try it with a much longer
word. So comment this out with uh
like electroc cardioraphic electroc
cardioaphic
graphic
when we call the old version it will
never finish. Yeah, it it will take a
long
a lot of time. But if we comment this
out but run this function for electroc
cardiographic, we'll see that there is
this number of permutations of those
letters. We know it without having to
generate them because that would take
far too long.
So uh as uh I mentioned earlier we can
discode replace we can greatly simplify
or shorten this code using default dict
instead of checking if the letter was in
dictionary and adding one or assigning
one we can use default dict
with integer.
And this means that for every new letter
there is already assigned zero. Zero is
assigned for any new key. So we just add
for letter in text
add one.
If it is in dictionary it will be
incremented. If it is not
then it is zero. So we increment it to
one as well. And it should give us the
same result. We can remember 422 378.
And now we have the same amount. You can
see how quick the program is. You can
check also if it is working for
permutations without the repetition. So
for the disk, it should be 24, right?
So now we have a function to count how
many per stationation exist both for set
and multis set and we also know how to
generate permutations using built-in
tools
like permutations uh function from ital
tools. In the next lesson we look at how
to build such a permutation generator
ourselves like this function
permutations. So we will explore
algorithm one of the many algorithms for
generating all permutations.
See you there.
Hello. As I said there are many
algorithms to generate all possible
permutations. One of the simplest is
HIPS algorithm which allows you to
generate all possible permutations in
such a way that each time maybe we can
see it.
I will
zoom it. Okay. Uh each time only two
elements swap with each other. So here
we have A B C D. After the first
swapping two elements A and B we have D
A C D. CD stays remains where it is. Uh
then during the second swap B swaps with
C and so on up to B C D A always only
once only pair swaps and that's it. We
know that it doesn't go from abd to dcba
but just guarantees us that the only two
elements will change each step right
because normally if we were doing this
where we would we would like to have a b
c d then a b d c the next element is a c
b d. Here we have three changes B to C,
D to B and C to D. Right?
Whereas here we swap only two elements
each time. Now let's go back
uh close this
100%.
And we can see that this algorithm is
incredibly simple. Here it is presented
in a different way.
K is actually the number of elements. So
in Python we can always count it using
plan. We have a list of elements. Uh K.
K is a number of elements on the
beginning because we have recursion
here. So initially it is the number of
elements. If you don't know what
recursion is, it is the calling of a
function by itself. So permutations call
permutations with other normally other
arguments. We'll talk about recollection
more in future. So we have a recussion
call for the same set but uh k1 smaller.
Now uh for i from zero to k minus one if
k is even we swap the current element
with the last one last in a sense of k
and if it is odd we swap the first
element with the last and again we have
a recursive call we will write a little
more pythonic code so we can make hip
permutations function have hip
permutations.
We have two inputs data and length or we
just put it uh s k like that like in
Wikipedia because it's not necessarily
the length of the whole array just the
length of the whole array at the first
time.
Uh now if K is one
and we can see it if K is one we just
write the array if K is one
as we have seen we printed data as it is
otherwise so return here otherwise for
every I from 0 to K for I in
0 to K we could write like this. Of
course, we can write simply K because
range has a default
um range K default value of zero. We
perform the operation recursively. If he
hip permutations
data k minus one as remember now if if k
is uh even then we perform as we have
seen swapping the given element with the
last. So if k modulo 2 is zero this is
even data i
data k -1 we swap this data k minus one
with data i. Else uh in situation k is
odd we swap uh first element with the
last one data of zero data k minus one
data k minus one data zero
and that's it. Um you can see that we
have one recursive call
here. There was two but it was with k
minus one. So I moved it after for loop
and merge with dot. We can see it
elements equals 1 2 3
and hip permutations
elements and len of elements initially.
Okay, let's see that
for the three elements we have six per
rotations.
One, two, three. Then we are swapping
one with two only one one swap. The same
three with two, one remains and so on.
We can see the same with one two three
four five. It should be 120 of them. You
can add information which one it is. Uh
but we can see that again we swap one
with three but five 4 2 here stays where
it was. To illustrate this even more I
load such a program quite simple one.
It is permutation uh permutations of
color balls
where we can see
per permutating elements. For example,
we can start animation for half a second
with three balls and we can animate
this.
So we see how they changed and we can do
like it was uh much faster because half
a second for five elements it is 1
minute. So now it should be less than
half a minute
and we can see how it looks like. Of
course you can
improve the code to see for example
three rows
uh the last three rows to see even more
that only two are swapping. But yeah uh
we cannot uh see all 120 especially if
it is small. Uh
of course we can uh we can write a
program uh that every of this uh
permutations is saved as an image and
then merge this image to to see
something like it was on Wikipedia.
Okay, this lesson is all over. I invite
you to the next ones.
Hello. Now when we know many aspects of
permutations, let's learn about
different type of permutations.
A k permutation sometimes r permutation
of a set. Also partial permutation
sequence without repetition or variation
is an ordered arrangement of k distinct
elements selected from the set. So for
example for our set X 1 to 3 those are K
permutations
we can say that there are three one
element K permutations 1 2 3 just like
that six two element K permutations 1 2
1 3 and so on and six three element K
permutations which are in fact
permutations right so yes the normal
permutation is The special case of K
permutation where K equals N. And we
have other type a K taple of a set also
known as permutation with repetition
sequence with repetition or variation
with repetition is an ordered
arrangement where each element can be
selected multiple times. So in fact it
is not permutation but it is uh often
called that way. So for the set x 1 2 3
some examples of k tapus are one one one
two three three to one or three three
two there are three one element k tapus
1 2 3 the same as for k per rotations
nine two element k taples 27 three
element k taples
in fact there can be four element K
tapus five element K tapus for three
elements because elements can repeat
right. So K permutations
K can be up to N from one to N. But for
K taples there is no upper bound. And
again we can say how many permutations
there are. The number of K permutations
of N element set. So without repetition
is given by this formula and factorial
divided by n minus k factorial or the
other form of the same formula. So we
start with n minus k + 1*
+ 1 + 1 + 1 up to n. The number of k
taples now with repetition from an an
element set is given by the formula n to
the power of k. So we have an example
how many free element sequences can be
formed from a set of seven elements
without repetition and with repetition.
We have these formulas. Alternative
version of this example of this exercise
could be how many letter words can be
formed using only the letters A to G.
Right? Because we have seven elements.
So A, B, C, D,
E, F and G. And we are considering how
many sequences we can formed without
repetitions
like a bc
like uh a d
and so on. So this is
p uh n is 7 k is 3
7 factorial / 7 - 3 factorial it is 7
factorial / 4 factorial
short hand here you add one to the
denominator it is five and times 6 up to
this number so it
210.
There are 210
sequences like that. And when elements
can repeat like
ABC again but also abb
a aaa and so on. We have
t 73
and it is just 7 to the power of 3. So
it is uh 49
* 7 it is 50 * 7 350 without 7 so it is
343.
Okay. So those are two let's say new
types of penotations but in fact we will
not use them too much because in the
next video we will learn much better way
to analyze uh exercises like that and uh
to compute the results. See you there.
Hello. Right after K permutations and K
taputs, we move on to the topic of the
rule of product which is a broader
concept that the two previously
mentioned but also easier to remember.
By the rule of product also
multiplication principle we call this
theorem that claims if a process
consists of n steps and there are a1
options or choices for the first step in
the process a2 options choices in the
second step of the process and so on.
Then the number of possible outcomes
of possible possibilities
is a1 * a2 * x* times a n. Important
note here the number of options
available at each step can't depend on
the choices made in the previous steps.
So if we have 10 choices at the second
step, it must be 10 choices regardless
of which of the A1 options is chosen.
Example, a man getting ready to leave
his house can choose from five pairs of
pants, eight shirts, and three pairs of
shoes. In how many different ways can he
get dressed for going out? By the rule
of the product, number of ways is 5 * 8
* 3, which is 120. And that's it. That's
the number of ways. Yeah. So, in each
step, he can choose let's say constant
number of clothes. I mean, he's not a
woman. So, so after choosing pants, he
still has eight shirts. here does not
apply situation where specific pair of
pants is not compatible with uh one
shirt. Right? More complicated example.
Many years ago in the United States and
Canada, there was a telephone number
format known as two letters, five
numbers. So the numbers were created by
choosing two letters from uppercase
alphabet and then five uh digits. In
fact here is five numbers that was the
name but there was five digits. Right?
So an example is PL1 2 3 4 5 which meant
dialing 1 2 3 4 5 through the telephone
exchange center plaza. That's why PL not
from Poland. So the first two letters
usually refer to the name of the local
telephone exchange. And again, how many
different subscribers could there have
been at most during that time? Not so
many. So the first letter could be any
of the 26 letters of the English
alphabet from A to Z. Regardless of the
first choice, the second letter could
also be any of those 26 letters. Then
there were five digits. Any digit from 0
to 9. So we can use rule of product to
compute that in total there were 67
millions and 600,000
possibilities. So the standard couldn't
last up to this date but back then was
reasonable. The rule of product is a
more general concept than underly
permutations including K permutations
and K tapus and we can see it. So the
rule of product as a permutations when
we have seven floors including the
ground floor and six people that enter
the elevator and they want we don't know
for what purpose. Maybe they need to
investigate something, but they won't
get off on a different floor than how
many different ways they have. So on the
first floor can get out anyone from
those six people. On the second floor,
anyone of five remaining and so on and
so on. You can also think that first
person has six choices. Then the next
person have five choices and so on. So
the total number of possibilities is 6 *
5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 which is 6 factorial
720 ways. It is just a permutations,
right? Because there are six people, six
floors to get off. They are on the
ground floor, right? So, we just need to
permutate them all. Now, the rule of
product is a K permutations. The same
situation, seven floors, but only three
people and they also want to get off on
a different floor. So, the first person
has six choices. The next person has
five choices and the next person has
four choices, four floors to choose. So
in total is 6 * 5 * 4 which is 120. And
it is exactly the formula for k
permutations, right? 6 factorial divided
by 6 - 3 factorial which is 3 factorial.
And we didn't need to understand it or
remember that it is capable per
mutations. We just multiply. And again
the rule of product as a kapus. Now we
have we have the same amount of floors
five people but they can go whenever
they want. Of course when they are on
ground floor they don't want to go to
ground floor. So the first person has
six choices, six floors to choose. The
second person has again six floors to
choose and so on and so on. Each of the
five people have six choices. So firstly
six choice, second six choice, third six
choice and so on six to the power of
five which is 7,776.
And it is exactly as how many there are
five taples with repetitions of the six
element set or how many there are five
letter words consisting each solely of
the letters A B CDE E F but they can
repeat. So the rule of product replace
everything we know so far permutations K
permutations and K tapples we don't need
to use them anymore. So the rule of
product says that if the first bag or
the set contains n1 objects, the second
bag contains n2 objects and so on, the
cave back contains n k objects. Then if
we randomly select one object from each
bag, the total number of different
possible outcomes final states after all
selection is multiplication of how many
objects there are in each bag. Again
remember that choosing one from from one
bug does not change the number of
elements in the second bug. Right? And
the last information the role of product
is closely related to the logical
connector and when you hear and you you
can read it as multiply. So in the first
example, one of five pairs of pants and
one of eight shirts, it means five * 8
and one of three pairs of shoes times
three. Each occurrence of the word and
corresponds to a multiplication
operation. So it is extremely easy.
Every time we are considering how many
ways there are and we can build a
sentence with only with and as a
connection then it is a rule of product
and we just need to multiply
possibilities. Okay, let's see some more
difficult examples. See you in the next
lesson.
Hello. Now when we know the rule of
product, we can solve many combinatorial
problems. I've chosen five. Let's do
them all. Exercise one. How many
five-digit odd natural numbers are there
that contain only the digits 0 1 2 3 in
the decimal representation.
So we have five places
I mean digits. Here
there is a constraint that the numbers
should be odd. So the last one can be
only one or three. So there are two
options. So uh as you can see I will put
the number of options above
the lines and options if I put options I
will put them below the line. Now let's
go from the left to right.
As the first digit can be 1, two or
three. It can't be zero. Right? The
natural number can't start with zero. So
there are three possibilities. Now it
can be any of those four digits. So the
there is four four and four. And this is
the way that normally uh we can solve
problems with the rule of product. So
the answer is 3 * 4 ^ of 3 * 2 which is
let's count it 6 3 * 2 4 * 4 is 16 * 4
is 64
and it is 6 * 4 is 24 6 * 6 is 360 so it
is 384
+ 20, right?
There are 384
numbers like those five ones, 1 2 3 0 3
and many other that are five digits odd
natural numbers only with those four
digits. Okay,
let's go to exercise two. How many four
digitive and natural numbers are there
in which the decimal notation contains
only the digits 2 4 7 like 72 72 and so
on. It is similar but we have four
digits. So four lines
and uh it is even natural numbers this
time. So only two numbers two digits can
be at the last place two or four. But on
the beginning can be any of any of 247
2 47 and 247 again. Right? So we have
three possibilities. Three
possibilities. Three possibilities. And
when we multiply it, it is 3 to the^ of
3 * 2 which is 27 * 2 which is 54.
Now exercise three. Consider all
fourdigit codes formed only from the
digits 1 3 6 8 with each of these digits
occurring exactly once in each code. How
many such codes are there?
So we have four
digits for places to put a digit. Right?
We do not have any information that
those uh codes should be odd or even. So
we can start from the beginning. At the
beginning we have four digits right?
If we choose
one of them we have one less. If we
choose three we have one 6 eight. Now
right
then we have two options and then we
have one options. For example, if we
have chosen one, we have 68 here. And
the same if we have chosen six, we have
only eight here. So the answer is four
factorial, which is 24.
We didn't need to think that it is a
factorial, right? We just compute it.
Now two different vertices are drawn
simultaneously from the vertices of the
cube ABCD efgh.
What is the probability that these
vertices will be the ends of the
diagonal of the cube ABCD E F G H?
So let's uh see the cube
maybe I am
able to draw it.
Okay,
we have a cube
A B C D E F G H.
uh we haven't talked about probability
yet but uh in this course we'll consider
only classic probability. So it means
that probability equals to how many
options passes our constraints
divided by how many options there are
and that's it. Okay.
So probability is a fraction. How many
possibles are good for us? how many uh
possibles there are. Okay,
we want to draw simultaneous on the okay
two uh two different vertices. So we
have
in general
we have one of eight options and after
that we have one of seven options which
is 56.
But we want those vertices
uh to be a diagonal of the cube.
So if we choose E and H, it's not the
case. A and E, it's not the case because
it is a side of this cube, right? It is
this line of this cube, not a diagonal.
The same with A and F. It is diagonal
but of this side.
uh it is a diagonal of side A B F E
which is a square diagonal of A from A
is to G right this is a diagonal of a
cube the same with B and H and similar
so on the beginning
we can choose any of those vertices that
are eight of them but since we have
chosen for example H we have only one
possib probability P to be diagonal of
the cube. So only one then
the probability is 8 / 56 which is 4 /
28 which is one of the seven.
Okay. Now the last one exercise five. A
player rolls a symmetrical six-sided die
twice and calculates the sum of the
numbers rolled.
Calculate the probability of event A
that the sum of the numbers rolled is
equal to four or five or six.
So again
probability is how many possibles are
good for us divided by how many
possibles there are. And those how many
possible there are is often written as
the size of omega which is the size of a
set of all options but it is
uh on the first die we have six options
and on the second die we have also six
options which is 56. You can see that I
omit those lines. I don't put them
anymore because uh they are not
necessary. Yeah, they were only for the
beginning to understand the rule of
product. Okay, but how many
uh good events there are?
We can count them. If the first row is
one
then on the second row must be three
then the sum is four or four the sum is
five or five the sum is six.
If the first die has two points, right,
points of the die, then on the second
die must be two points or three points
or four points to
to be some four, five or six.
If the first d is one,
the number of dots is three. Then on the
second die the number of dots must be 1,
two or three to make the sum four, five
or six.
Now if the first d is four
on the second die we have only options
one or two. We cannot have sum four. If
there is four on one dice.
Uh if uh on the first die we have five
points dots then uh on the second uh
must be one and then we have sum six. If
the first I have six points dots then
there is no option to have the sum four
five or six. So the set is empty. How
many how many options there are? 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
12 options are good and are 36 options.
So the probability of the event A
that the sum of the number S is equal to
four or five or six is 12 / 36 which is
1 / 3 which is approximately
0.333
and so on. Right? So you can see how the
rule of product is simple in use, right?
Okay. In the next lesson we will check
some of those computations
programmatically.
See you there.
Hello. I've run a python such an
interactive python cell and now if you
want to count how many there are
completely not optimal but just how many
fivedigit
number odd numbers that have only the
digits 0 1 to three in their
representation
we can use for loop. So let's say that
how many is equal to zero for now for in
a range between 10,000 we go from 10,000
which is the first possible number
to the last possible number which is
99,999
since uh the interval is open I add a
one here so that 99,000 and so on is
also the inclining to account now I make
the condition that the number must be
odd. Um that is the number is not
divisible by two. So the remainder is
equal to one. If I divided by two the
remainder is equal to 1. Then I change
the number into a string.
Then the string I change to set. So I
have set of digits. Right? set of digit.
Okay.
And I check whether the set of digits is
only 0 1 to 3. Uh but what I mean is if
the number if those digits are a subset
of digits 0 1 2 3 we can see it in a
moment. So let's say if set of digits
is subset
of the set it is string so I need to put
it in apostrophes
0 1 2 3 then we want to count it. So how
many plus equals 1.
Initially we have uh how many equals to
zero and then we can check
how many
and it is 384
which is exactly what we were supposed
to get.
Why I haven't checked if a set of digits
is exactly 0 1 2 or three because it
would uh pass only if it is like this
number but it wouldn't pass when it is
five ones because five ones has only one
digit one. So we cannot check if set of
digits is equal to one set of the only
element 0 1 2 3 because then
uh this case wouldn't be counted. You
can check it right. Okay. Go back. What
about the probability exercise? So very
similarly we can also write a program.
We can simulate dice flows
twice throwing the dice and whether our
condition will be met. Our condition is
when the sum is four, five or six. And
we can see how often we get it right.
And this is the same as probability.
Okay, this is neither a perfect way to
solve this programmatically
nor an optimal way in terms of speed but
it is a very simple way and in this way
we can quite quickly check whether our
result makes sense at all. Quickly I
mean in terms of writing the code not
code running. For this we will import.
So from random import rand from random
library we import rand
in int.
Okay we write down the number of
simulations. So let's uh let it be a
million. So 10 to the^ of six
for each simulation for in range n
for each of them. And now we are
actually drawing the numbers from 1 to
six. We should also write successes for
example
right and okay we are now drawing the
numbers. So the number a is rand between
1 and six
and uh the number b run and again one of
uh 1 to six. Here both ranges are
inclusive in run int. So successes
initially are equal to zero. And now if
a + b if a + b is in set 4, five or six
in four, five or six, we increase the
number of successes by one. Successes
plus equal one.
Okay, we press enter and wait a while.
We can't uh we can check the successes.
it is 333,000.
Okay, we count the probability
P in that way that it is the number of
successes successes sorry divided by all
the number of events which is n. So the
probability is this in this way we can
show it
we will print even
verbility
is
P and we can multiply it by 100 see it
as a percent with two decimal places
with rounding. So it is 33.33%.
So we computed it correctly. You can see
of course that if you compute it many
times you can get different answer.
Now let's again compute P and again
it is 33.37.
To get closer to our correct answer,
math correct answer, we can increase the
number of events. How many times those
dices are those dice are rolled. So we
we can change n to the^ of 7 which is 10
millions.
And then if we compute it, it will be
much more accurate. So it should be
33.33
always.
So
this is uh a problem in this way that we
can have a wrong
uh answer if uh n is quite small. You
can see that even here we don't have a
good answer but when we repeat it we
should get 33.33
much often that for the first uh way
when n was only
uh 10 ^ 6 it is not accurate yet. Yeah.
uh you can change n to 10 ^ of 8 and
then it really should be 33.33
but it will compute for some time. I
will cut the video here and you can see
that when you increase the number of
events the result is much more accurate.
Okay, 15 seconds later, we can compute
the successes and it is 33.33.
So the math way is much more precise
that this way. Okay, that's it for this
lesson. See you in the next one.
Hello. Related to the rule of product is
the second rule, the rule of sum. And
this is because the rule of product is
insufficient. By the rule of sum also
the addition principle or the addition
rule, we call the theorem stating that
this is my definition that is correct
but suited for solving problems. If we
have to break down the multiplication
rule, the rule of product or any other
analysis into separate disjoint cases,
the number of possibilities we are
interested in is the sum of the number
of possibilities in each of these cases.
Example one, which is obvious in the
three drawers we have in turn five
balls, four balls and three balls. First
door have five balls. Second drawer has
four balls and the last drawer has three
balls. In how many ways we can choose
one ball from among the first two
drawers? Here is the solution. From the
first drawer we choose one of the five
balls or from the second drawer we
choose one of the four balls. In total
nine ways. This is pretty obvious
intuitive. Anyone on the spot would
answer that if we have five balls in one
place, four in another. And someone
asked us to give one ball, we can choose
one of the nine. But you can already see
the rule here. There are separated cases
and we add possibilities. And a more
serious example too. How many five-digit
even numbers are there with different
digits? It may seem that we can solve
this with the rule of product. And we
will try a solution attempt. We write
down our underlinings five lines. Well,
and we can start with the last element.
Due to the fact that the condition is
set there, parity depends on the last
digit. We start from it. We put one of
five digits there. 0 2 4 6 or 8. At the
last place, right? The number must be
even. So here must be 0 2 4 6 or 8.
Right? Given what we know from the rule
of product, we would simply insert a
five there because one of the five
digits. And now there is a question. How
many digits can we now put in the first
place here?
Well, it would seem that eight because
we can't put a zero at the very
beginning and we can't put the one that
we put at the end, right? So by default
we can put here one of the nine digits
at the very beginning from 1 to 9 you
can't put a zero. If we inserted 2 4 6
or eight here at the very end we cannot
put them at the beginning as well. So
eight possibilities but yeah by default
we can insert one of nine there is that
but if there is a zero at the end we
still have nine possibilities. If you
put 2 4 6 8 we cannot put zero and for
example two here we have eight
possibilities. But if it is zero here
then we cannot put only zero here. We
can put 1 2 3 up to nine. So nine
possibilities. So we don't know whether
to insert eight or nine here because it
depends on what we inserted here at the
at the end. And we have this conclusion.
If while analyzing a problem we notice
that we cannot solve it using only the
multiplication rule the product and that
a different number must be used in a
given step depending on the case. Then
we consider these cases separately and
sum the results. So now let's solve it.
We wanted to use the rule of product
here. We already know that it is
insufficient. The result depends on
whether there is a zero at the end or
whether there is a one of these digits
at the end. We break down the solution
on the left side. If there is a zero at
the end, if zero stands at the end, then
there is one particular digit, a zero,
one particular digit. And if it stands
any of these, it means one of the four
digits, right? one possibility zero.
Four possibilities for numbers 2 4 6 or
8. Now we go from the left. If a zero is
inserted here, how many possibilities
are there? As I said, you can insert any
number from 1 to 9. So there are nine
possibilities. If on the other hand we
inserted a 2 4 6 or an 8 here at the
end. For example, imagine that we put a
six here. Then you can put digits from 1
to 5 or 7 or 8 or 9 here. So there is
eight possible digits here. That's how
much we insert. Now we are considering
the second place in both cases. If here
is inserted a zero and here n of the
nine digits for example one here it can
be any digit from 2 to 9 there are eight
possible digits. Similarly here if a
digit is uh inserted here suppose a two
and here was suppose five then there
would normally be 10 here but you can't
insert those two. So there are eight
possibilities right eight here and eight
here. After that we go as usual since
all the digits are 10 and we cannot use
this digit this digit this digit. We can
put seven digits here.
And again there are 10 digits in total.
We cannot put one of those uh that is
put here. We cannot uh put that is on
the beginning. We cannot put that one
that is on the second place. So we have
seven possibilities and then six and
six. Here we have two different cases
depending on whether there is a zero at
the end or not. And we have to by the
rule of product calculate separately the
first case with zero and separately the
case without zero. The result for the
left side that is marked in blue. It is
the product of 9 * 8 * 7 * 6. It is
normal the rule of product for the right
side marked uh in green. It is the
product of 88 8764.
Also by the rule of product for the
first case we have 3,24
possibilities. For the second case
10,752
possibilities a total of 13,776
possibilities.
That is there are so many five-digit
even numbers with different digits. We
can check the result very quickly in a
Python. How many is already typed and
now like this 40 in range from we go
from 10,000 again five digits to 99999
and we add a one because the interval is
wide open. So we want to take 99999 into
account. We want even numbers. So is
even is equal to I the reminder when we
divide it by two is equal to zero. Yeah,
this is a B value about different
digits. Uh now we convert a number into
text
and text into set
and we want to check if that set of not
repeated elements has length equal five.
Five different
digits
equals to if len is of that set is equal
to five. If both cases, both constraints
conditions pass. If it's even and
five different digits,
then we increase the value of how many
how many plus equal one. Okay, we check
how much we got out. How many?
And it is 13,776.
Exactly what was in the presentation.
Okay, let's go back to the presentation.
Just as the rule of product
multiplication rule involves the
conjunction and the rule of sum,
addition rule, addition principle
involves the conjunction or. Here by or
we mean a conjunct that only one of the
situations at a given time is true. Zero
at the end or another digit at the end.
Either we were in this situation or we
were in that situation and we count how
many possibilities there are in total
being unaware of which situation will
happen. Okay. So if we see or in the
text that's probably where the addition
will be. The rules of product and sum
have much wider broader applications and
are used among other things in
combinations. This will be covered in
this course in future lessons. Formally
we can write I found a very interesting
definition while preparing this
presentation. The definitions from the
presentation about the rule of product
and that one in this presentation about
the rule of sum are correct. Here I will
present different equivalent
definitions.
Rule of product. If a choice involves
making k decisions in succession one
after another where the first can be
made in a1 ways the second in a2 ways
the nth in a n ways then such a choice
can be made in a1 * a2 * a3 * n * a n
ways. We know that. Now the rule of
thumb. If a choice involves making one
of k decisions where the first can be
made in a1 ways, the second in a2 ways
and so on the nth in a n ways then such
a choice can be made in a1 plus a2 plus
plus a n ways. Where is the difference?
The difference is here. decisions in
succession on consecutively
sequentially k decisions
just like we have five underscores and
consecutively
sequentially decide
sequentially does not have to be from
left to right because in our case we
used started from the last one right we
usually should start where there is a
condition for example that the number
must be even or odd
and then from left to right. So uh here
is k decisions uh in succession sequence
and here one of k decisions
like in our example one of the decision
is that a zero is at the end and one of
the decisions is that at the end is 2 4
6 or 8 and these cases should be finally
added up summed up in this text those
definitions you can see are almost
identical. It is a specially chosen
vocabulary to write down the definition
of both rules. Just like that, almost
identical. Okay. Finally, I will say
remind you that in the addition rule,
the rule of sum decisions must be
mutually exclusive. That is if we have
to choose one ball from two drawers like
in the first example, we cannot take
half from one drawer and other half from
the other. Yes, there will be more about
situation where these choices are not
mutually exclusive in the future. Okay,
that's everything here. See you in the
next video with more examples.
Hello. So, we have three exercises for
the rule of thumb. Let's do them. If you
want, you can stop the video now and do
them yourself. Then go to the end of
this video and see if you have good
results. Exercise one. How many
four-digit numbers are there that are
divisible by five if the digits can
repeat?
So we have exercise
1.8 A and if there are four digits we
have four underscores
1 2 3 four at the end if they are
divisible by five can can be zero or
five so two digits
at the beginning can be nine digits
because from 1 to 9 there cannot be zero
and here 10 and 10 we put
multiplications here and 9 * 2 is 18 and
* 100 it is 1,800
and that's all here.
Point B the digits cannot repeat. So at
the end can be zero
the specific digit and then here can be
any of digits from 1 to 9. So nine then
here cannot be this digit that it it is
here and this zero. So 8 and seven.
Similarly
if at the end is five
the specific digit one digit
then at the beginning cannot be zero and
five. So we have eight possibilities and
here cannot be this digit here and this
five. So eight again because zero can be
here right here was excluded and here it
is possible to put zero and seven here.
I don't uh put uh those dots for
multiplications anymore. we know that
there uh they are there and I will not
uh put once in multiplications because
it changes nothing. So the result is
like this
and we can compute it you can compute it
uh on calculator or by hand. I will make
some fun here. So for example, we have 8
and 7 here and 8 and 7 here. So it is 8
* 7 before the parentheses.
Then * 9 + 8.
So it is 56
* 17.
And uh to compute that we can write 56 *
17 is 20 without 3. So 56 * 20 56 * 2 is
112
and zil at the end
and uh 3 is uh 100 150 and 18 so minus
168
and that way we can compute that um 20
uh without 8 is 2. We have uh 12 here.
112 - 650.
We have 1,00 and uh - 100 is 952.
Here by the way there is an element of a
test to see if we have a good result. So
uh such a cursory check because this
result uh well the this is cannot repeat
must be always smaller. So this must be
always be greater than
the one where this is cannot repeat.
Right? So when this is can repeat is
always greater than where they cannot
repeat.
So here uh so that way we can easily
check if we probably have a good answer.
Okay. Exercise two.
Exercise two.
Uh point A.
Uh how many five-digit numbers are there
that are divisible by 25? If the digits
can repeat.
So when numbers are divisible by 25 uh
when at the end is
0 0 or the 25 or 50 or 75
and because uh digits can repeat we
could do it that way
at the end can be zero or five. So two
digits
and if it is zero so just before the
zero can be zero or five. So two digits
and if it is five before five there can
be two or seven. So also two digits and
we can put two but the the writing is
clouded here. Why two? Why not four?
Because we you know we have four digits
here right
two because those two or those two not
uh four possibilities right but uh let's
improve that even if it is digits can
repeat situation when digits can repeat
we can always break
those cases.
So we can put zero here the specific
digit and five here the specific digit.
If there is zero we can put
uh zero to two uh zero or five sorry 0
or five here.
So two possibilities and if there is
five at the end we can put two or seven
at this place. So again two
possibilities and now it is clear why
two okay uh this is can repeat. So here
can be nine digits and here 10 or 10 10
all 10 and we need we just need to
compute that in fact it is the same
number here and here. So we have 9 * 10
* 10 * 2 * 2 because we have twice the
same case.
This uh is 1,800. So it is 300600
3,600
the same as amount of seconds in an
hour.
Okay. Point B the cannot repeat. So
again let's start with zero at the end.
If there is zero at the end
digits cannot repeat. So 0 0 can't be
the case. So the only case is 50
again specific uh digit at the not at
the end but the previous place.
So we cannot put zero or five here.
There is eight possibilities. And here
again um there cannot be zero five and
this digit. So seven and six.
And the second case when there is five
at the end the specific digit. So before
that there can be two or seven. So two
possibilities.
Then here cannot be five. Let's say two
and cannot be zero. So we have seven
possibilities here
cannot be those three zero can be so
seven and six and again we have
quite a nice
computation
7 * 7 * 6 * 2 because uh 7 * 6 is
repeated here and here. So we can
compute it that way. uh 7 * 6 is 56 and
uh in parenthesis we have 8
+ 7 * 2 is 14.
So it is 56 * 22
and uh 22 is again * 20 * 2
uh 56
I said
uh sorry 7 u it was when it was uh 8 * 7
7 * 6 is not 56
it is uh okay
let's erase it
uh 7 * 6 is 42 Right. Yes. 42. And so
on. We need to erase
that as well. Okay. 42.
And uh again 42 * 20 42 * 2. 42 * 2 is
84. So we have 840 + 84 which is quite
easy. It is 924.
And that's all.
So you can see the rule of sum here and
here and you can see that uh even if we
use uh uh multiplication rule the rule
of product uh you can always split the
cases to use rule of sum instead of rule
of product. Yes, of course in one case
we multiply the uh possibilities.
Okay,
exercise three. In a certain soccer
team, there are three defenders, five
midfielders, and two forwards. The coach
decided to s two players from different
positions. For example, for interview,
for television. In how many ways can he
do it? So, we have
uh soccer era, soccer field probably
that's the name.
Okay.
Uh we have
place where ball wants to go
here and here. Uh let's say we have one
team. So here are defenders
D and D. Three defenders. Five
midfielders. So they are here.
Midfielder. Midfielder. Midfielder.
midfielder and midfielder
and two forwards.
Forward and forward. Okay. So, the coach
uh wants to choose two of them but from
different positions. So, he can choose
one defender,
defender
and
uh midfielder. This is one case.
feel that
in how many ways can he do uh do that?
uh he can choose one of three defenders
and one ends. So multiplication one of
five uh midfielders right so we have
five here
and uh three times five is 15.
He can also choose
differently defender and forward player
forward.
So then one of three defenders times uh
one of two uh forwards.
So six possibilities if he wants choose
uh defender and forward. And the last
case is that he wants to choose
midfielder.
We assume that um it doesn't matter if
he choose defender and midfielder or
midfield defender right because
yeah norally there is no
difference uh in order uh of choosing
people right midfielder and forward
there is the last case
so there are five midfielders and two
forward forward. So we have 10
possibilities
and to
to compute how many possibilities there
are we can see that those are cases that
does not repeat. So we can ch they are
disjoint right. So we can just use the
rule of sum. So the total number of
possibilities is 15 + 6 + 10 equals 21.
Okay, I think you can easily
program Python program or other uh
programming language program programs
that uh computes those
uh values to check if they are correct.
But uh we can talk how to program this
algorithm this uh choosing it's 31 sorry
not [snorts] 21 31 sorry okay uh how to
how to program a program that computes
that how to do it let's see that so we
have uh how many 38 we have 10 people
and we can call them that way. People
equals
defender defender defender midfielder
midfielder midfielder midfielder
midfielder
and uh forward forward.
As always we can put how many equals
zero.
And now we are choosing two people four
in land.
How many people there are minus one
because uh we want to choose one of
those. And if we choose uh one uh we
choose
uh people from the right. Right. It is
obvious because if we choose a defender,
we need to choose midfielder or forward.
If we choose midfielder,
we only want to choose forward because
the case defender and midfielder was
already considered. Okay.
So
for J in range I + one
two line of people
and you can see that uh here we have
choices up to here because uh at the
right of this forward there is nobody.
So we we step back for I I the last I
can be here and then J can be also be
chosen. Okay.
And in that way we consider all
possibilities.
Person one is people
I person two is people
J.
And in that way we can choose D and D if
I is zero and J is one
D and M MM and FF. Yeah, right. So
that's why we have I + one in that way.
Of course we can choose D and F for
example. But uh we are sure that I is
not equal J. And now if person one is
different from person two, they are not
from the same era, we increase how many
plus equals 1 and it should be 31. And
that's right. So that's simple program.
You can analyze it. Uh of course you can
write it uh differently. It's not it's
not that hard to do it. Yeah, we saw how
rule of product and rule of sum are
powerful. It was much easier to compute
it mathematically then write the code
and quicker. In the nearest uh lessons
we will see that rule of product and
rule of sum they are both not sufficient
for all cases and we will cover another
rule. See you there. Bye.
Hello. Before we jump to the new rule,
the new principle, we need to understand
two notations, two type of notations uh
that we will use in this course. First,
the sum notation. The result of addition
called the sum can arise from the
process summation of a large number or
even an infinite number of numbers.
often following a certain pattern
formula. In such a case, writing the sum
explicitly becomes cumbersome. For
example, when you have sum like that.
So, it is sum of squares from 1 to 12. 1
square 2 square 3 square and so on up to
12 squared. Instead of the full
expression, we can write the sum as 1 +
4 + 9 + 3 dots + 144. However, if we are
dealing with a situation where the last
element is unknown, we haven't
calculated it yet. Like here 12 squared
is known that it is 144. But 99 square
maybe we don't know or we don't want to
compute it right now. But we know the
number of elements to be summed. We can
use the following notation. 1 square + 2
square + 3 square + dots + 192 square.
We don't know how much is 192 square but
we want to sum all squares from 1 to 192
and this is nice short notation.
However, it is not enough. For example,
next we may encounter a sum of such
compressed sums. So sum of all integers
from 1 to 100 then sum of squares from 1
to 100. Then sum of cubes from 1 to 100.
And again it's going to be cloudy. Where
is what? To highlight the separateness
of the uh of these sums, we can use
parentheses.
Then it is more obvious what is going to
be summed here.
However, we may deal with a large number
of such parenthesis in which case we
write
so sum of integers, sum of the squares,
sum of the cubes, four power, fifth
power plus dots up to 100
power of integers from 1 to 100. You can
see that it's going to be hard to read
or understand even if we use dot
notation.
We may also arrive at a situation where
these sounds are infinite. Infinite
should be lower case here. Though the
result may or may not be. For example,
sum of squares of fractions, right? 1 2
+ 1 / 2² + 1 / 3² it is 1 / 9 plus and
so on. The same with third power. the
same the same the same up to 102 power.
All this leads to the need to shorten
simplify the notation. Even though those
uh parentities uh have infinite number
of numbers all those sums are finite
here and it is uh hard to read this
notation right. So we need have short
and simplified one. And here where sigma
notation comes in the summation notation
sum sigma refers to the notation where
the to the right of the large Greek
letter sigma we write a formula or rule
for generating the successive elements
to be summed. So on the right hand of
sigma there is a formula below the sigma
sign we write the index and information
about the starting point of the
summation. Mostly it was one in our
cases. Why at the top we write the
number of which we want to stop the
summation in our case was 102.
Substituting into the index. So
notations like those 1 + 4 + 9 and up to
144. The second 1 + 4 + 9 + dot + 144
which is shorter. All with squares
without computing exact values. 1 square
+ 2 square + 3 square + and up to 12
square as well as those I = 1 up to 12
I² and the same but not below and up but
on the right hand of sigma side are all
equivalent. So to understand that here
we have formula and we put numbers I = 1
1 square then i = 2 2 3 square 4 4
square up to this point with it with 12
squared and between all those squares we
put plus and that sigma notation means
exactly that. So some cases this is 1
square 2 square 3 square up to 192
squared. So this and this means the
same. Here we have a nice situation when
we had already a sum of all inteious
from one to 100. Sum of all inteious
from 1 to 100 uh to the square power to
the cube power. We can write it that
way. from I = 1 to 100 I from I = 1 to
100 I² from I = 1 to 100 I cube
and this can be even shortened because
it is sum right uh if it is sum we can
rearrange elements. So 1 + 1 square + 1
cube 2 + 2 square 2 + 2 cube ++ + 100 +
100 to the square power + 100 to cube
power. We can write it that way. So we
can write it i + y i 2 + i cube from i =
1 to 100. And this is this exactly the
same. We can write it that or in rear
end order. It doesn't matter.
Here we have I= 5 up to infinity to I.
So when I is 5, 2 * 5 is 10. When I is
6, 2 * 6 is 12. 14 16 18 20 and up to
infinity. The same here I = 1 to
infinity. 1 divided by 3 I. So I is one
is one third. I is 2 is 1 divided by 6.
I is 3 it is 1 divided by 9 and so on.
And now sums can also be nested. You
remember that situation. We can add some
colors here. And you can see that this
is one sum right. So here we have sigma
from i = 1 to infinity.
I am putting it with mouse. So maybe
it's not
ideal handwriting but that way here we
have the same situation I=
1 to infinity
but it is 1 / i to the power of 3.
the same situation and uh this is I = 1
to infinity
1 divided by I to the power of 102
and those sums
this plus this plus this
uh the only difference is here 2 3 4 5
up to 102 and those 2 three up to 102
can be written with sigma sign as well.
So this is how we write it.
First
this is this green part that we already
discovered and here are those powers.
So how we how we compute it? First we
assign I equ= 2.
So we have j = 1 up to infinity
1 by
j to the^ of 2 and this is this part.
Next plus because sigma is plus and we
put I = 3.
J = 1 to the infinity
1 / J to the power of 3 plus the same
the same the same up to 102
J = 1 to infinity
1 by J to the power of 102
and all those sums are those green
parts. So instead of writing this we can
write only this thing. Typically nested
sounds are not encountered multiple
times.
So mostly it is nested twice like here.
If you want to indicate that we are
summing all or certain elements of a
given set, we write the membership
symbol for the index under the summation
sign. Example, we have a set of results
from rolling a six side dice. First,
there was three dots, then four dots,
four points, four dots, four dot, 66,
and so on. And if you want to sum all
those numbers, we just write the
notation sigma for every x from x
uppercase set x and that represent the
sum of all elements of the set x. We can
write some constraints here. Uh while in
the notation
sum all x of the set x where two divides
x represent the sum of all even elements
of the set x.
So here it means that we sum 4 + 4 + 4 +
6 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 6. This means
exactly that. And at the end, let's see
some selected properties of the
summation.
We saw it already. When we have the same
limits below the sigma sign and above
the sigma sign, we can put those two
things in the same sigma sign.
The same with difference. If we have C *
A I, we can put C which is constant
outside of the summation. For example,
if we sum from E = 2 to 10
to I which is 4 +
uh when I is 3 it is 6 plus and so on up
to I is 10. So 20.
Instead of that we can write that it is
the same as twice
sum from i = 2 to 10
i and it is 2
and i is 2 + 3 + 4 and so on up to 10.
So it is the same.
We can always put the constant outside
of the sigma sign. And if we have nested
sum where those limits are different but
this part based only on this uh
indicator and this part bases only on
this iterator. we can separate those
sums and uh compute the multiplication
the product of those results.
Okay, that's it. Don't worry about those
things if you are new to them. We will
not use them heavily. It is the most
important thing to understand that when
there are sums and there is a formula,
we can shorten the writing. We can
shorten how we write this sum. Okay,
that's all in this lesson.
Similar idea to sigma sign set union.
Just as the sigma symbol is used for the
notation of numerical summation, the
union symbol can be used for sets in
similar situations. The notation A1
union A2 union A3 union up to A 100 can
be written in one of the following ways.
limits I from 1 to 100
A I or I is from 1 to 100 A I those are
the same. Similarly infinity notation A1
union A2 union A3 and so on is written
as this. We know some sigma sign I more
or equal 1 a I or just sum s some as
union right union of all uh sets that
are written here. The last notation is
incorrect if we do not intend the union
of all of the given sets. For example,
if you want um uh union only odd sets
A1, A3, A5, you would write I equ= 1 or
here I more than or equal one. And uh
that two is not dividing I here and here
but we cannot put it here. And just as
the sigma symbol is used for the
notation of numerication, the union
symbol can be used for the sets in
similar situation. Similarly for the
intersection of sets there is the set of
intersection notation that is upside
down union symbol and for the
multiplication of numbers we can use the
large pi notation.
Examples when we have a1 all numbers
from 0 to infinity or integer numbers a2
all numbers from zero to infinity but
without one a3 without one and two and
so on. Then union of all those sets is
the same as A1 because
none of those next sets after A1 adds
any element to A1.
But the intersection is zero because it
is the only number that appears
everywhere.
We can have another example. For
example, A1 is
all those or maybe start with A2.
Sorry for that. And we put all divisible
by two. 2 4 6 and so on.
A three
all divisible by three 0 3 6 9 and so
on.
and a five for example
or divisible by uh five zero
5 10 and so on.
So the sum of them
will be all those numbers. So zero the
next is two the next is three the next
is five not five four
then is five
six
then would be eight and so on but there
would be no one and seven we know and uh
okay this is close bracket let's say uh
and intersection of plus a i would be
all those numbers that appears in all
those sets. So zero
uh 2 4 6 8 10 no
probably the next would be 30 I guess.
Yeah,
30 60 90 and so on
because 30 is the common least common
multiplication, right?
Okay.
So that what those uh two notation means
and as uh with sums we know what does it
mean I = 3 up to 8 I² by 3 it means 3 2
by 3 4 2 by 3 5 2 by 3 up to 8 squar by
3 divided by 3 and sum all those numbers
and uh the same with pi means the same
numbers but not sum but multiplication
of them. Okay, now we are ready for the
new principle. See you there.
Hello. We return to our rule of sum. The
additional rule as you remember
describes the way of counting the
cardinality the size of the set of two
disjoint sets specifically the union of
two disjoint sets.
We had the situation where the coach
either chose a certain person from
defense, one person from midfield or one
person from defense and one from forward
or one midfielder and one forwarder.
This situation could not overlap in any
way. They were disjoint.
For disjoint sets A and B, we have the
size of union of those two sets is equal
the sum of the sizes where this sign
this bracket this module of set denotes
cardality. The size of the set or
infinite of the set S. More generally
for disjoint sets A1, A2 up to A N we
have size of union of all sets is equal
to sum of sizes of individual sets which
leads us the cardinality of the union of
sets is equal to the sum of the
cardalities of the sets A1 A2 up to A N.
Equivalently we can write sum with dots.
However, this formula does not hold if
at least one pair of sets A I AJ is not
disjointed.
That means we cannot simply break them
into several sub cases and add the
numbers obtained in each subcase if
those cases can overlap. In the next
lesson, we will see many examples when
such situations occur. But now we have
the inclusion exclusion principle. The
inclusion exclusion principle allows us
to count the number of elements of the
union of sets that are not necessarily
disjoint. When cases may overlap repeat
the formula for the two sets A and B
then it is the size of union A and B
where those sets can overlap is equal to
size of the A size of the B minus the
intersection of those two sets. Visually
it looks like this. We have customers
who buy both fruits and vegetables. We
have certain customers for fruits, maybe
10 of them. Certain customers for
vegetables, maybe 10 of them as well.
This doesn't mean we have 20 customers
because some of them bought both fruits
and vegetables. We only know that the
number of customers is at most 20 as
long as our store only sells fruits and
vegetables. We have an example
situation. Customers for fruits. Someone
counted them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11.
We have 11 customers for fruits. And
another person is tasked with counting
customers who bought vegetables. 1 2 3 4
5 6 7 customers for the vegetables. They
have vegetables in the uh shopping
basket. If we have a third person, a
third salesman clerk who counts people
who bought both fruits and vegetables
who have both in their basket, they will
count four people. And the total number
of customers is the number of fruit
customers, the number of vegetable
customers, which is 18, minus the
customers who bought both fruits and
vegetables because they were counted
twice.
and we have 14 customers. If you only
knew that there are 11 customers for
fruits and seven customers for the
vegetables, no one counted people who b
who bought both. We could only estimate
the number of customers. We only we
could only say that the number of
customers is at least 11 because 11
people bought fruits. So there must be
at least 11 customers and at most 18 if
uh those group were disjoint. If no one
who bought fruits, bought vegetables and
similarly in other way. Yeah. Then we
could only approximate the number of
customers that is between 11 and 18 with
those numbers. So if you only counted
fruit customers and vegetable customers
separately, we could only conclude that
thing that the number of clients
is between 11 and 18. From the formula
for not disjoint sets immediately
follows the inequality that if we don't
know if sets are disjoint or not. We
know this inequality that the size of
union of two sets is less or equal the
sum of individual sets the size of them.
If they are disjoint this is equal if
not this is less. Such diagrams like the
one we saw a moment ago are called van
diagrams. So this part was counted once.
This part was counted once. But this
purple part was counted twice. So if you
want to know the a let's say the area
the size of a union b we need to
subtract this a once. Yeah because it
was counted twice. So the formula is
like we saw for three sets we have a van
diagram and the formula. So the sum of
those three sets is a + b + c. But then
this part a and c was counted twice. We
need to subtract it. Then a and b this
part was counted twice. We need to
subtract it. And b and c was counted
twice. We need to subtract this. But
then when we see this part that belongs
to every of those three sets, it was
counted once in A, once in B, once in
three, three times, then subtracted
once, subtracted twice, subtracted for
the first time. So it was not counted.
So we need to add it again. And that's
how this formula looks like. So the
cardality formula of the union of two
non-isjint sets A and B is for three
sets it is this formula. The coinary
formula for the unit of four nondisjint
sets A B C D is sum of individual sets
then subtract all pairs
then add all three poolles the
intersection of three sets then subtract
four sets and so on and so on. Add sizes
of intersection on five sets. Subtract
six sets. Add seven sets. And so on and
so on. Right? General principle. Add the
cardinality of the individual sets.
Subtract the cardinality of the
intersection of two sets. Add the
cardinality of the intersection of three
sets. Subtract the intersections of four
sets. Add the intersections of five
sets. Subtract add. Subtract add. And so
on. We can write it like that. The
general formula for the cardinality
measure of the union of ainite number of
sets. But in fact we don't need this. In
typical problems, schools, university,
the inclusion exclusion principle is
used for two to four sets. For a larger
number of sets, computers are used. So
an example of nondisjoint sets people
enrolling in Polish, German and Spanish
courses.
Those are free sets. By the way, here in
gold
is uh the statement that if these sets
were disjointed, that is a personal loss
either in the Polish course or the
Spanish course or the German cause only
one and exactly one of them. They cannot
enroll in both or none. then we simply
sum that part and the rest is not
needed. But if uh those sets and
normally that is the case are not
disjointed because people can enroll one
or more language courses. Let's say like
this if 10 people enrolled in the Polish
course
10
and
in
Polish
cause
should be lower case
six in German.
German
course
and four in Spanish
and those sets those people had to
enroll in only one course. So those sets
are disjointed. We know that there are
20 people, right? This is obvious. 10
people in Polish course, six in German
course, four in Spanish course. If there
if those courses are at the same time,
people cannot be on both, we have 20
people, right?
But
if people could or student students
could enroll to one or two or even three
of those courses, we only know that
there are at most 20 people
and at least 10 people that uh this
amount of the greater set
And we cannot say anything more if we
don't have more data. If you know how
many people enrolled to both Polish
German, Polish Spanish and German
Spanish Spanish and we know how many
people enrolled to all of them. We can
say how many people there are for
example, right? We will see that in a
moment in the next video. See you there.
Hello. Now we have four exercises. I
know you see one for now for our new
principle when cases can overlap. So we
have a group of students was asked
whether they have a dog or a cat at
home. The chart shows the results of
this survey. So 15% of students have a
cat at home. 65% of students have a dog
and 25%
answer that they don't have
neither a dog nor a cat. But some people
that have a cat have a dog as well and
we don't know yet how many of them.
Determine what percentage of the
responders do not have a dog. So this is
quite easy.
Exercise 1 A. As always, you can press
solve the problem and then check your
results with my video. Do not have a
dog. 65% of people have a dog. So 100%
minus 65%
it is 35%
of people do not have a dog.
But exercise B, exercise 1B, have both a
cat and a dog. And this is what I wanted
to discover. To solve this, we need
again do this this uh vin diagram.
Normally in the probability, but not
only here as well, we draw a rectangle
that rep represents
a 100% of people.
So this is 100%.
there is a
circle or a disk that uses 65% of this
area.
So for example, we have
I have a cat is a set A. I have a dog is
set B. So the area of B is 65% of this
rectangle.
So this is B.
15% of this rectangle
is set A and there is an overlap maybe
but probably there is I have neither a
dog nor a cat. Is this place right?
Everything except A or B.
So everything except A or B is
100%
minus 25%.
Which is 75%.
That means A union B encloses bounds an
area of 75%.
But a + b so a union b is equal 75%.
Which is equal the size of a plus size
of b minus the overlap.
A is 15%.
B is 65%.
So we have 75%
equals 15% + 65% is 80%
minus the the size of this area that
overlaps.
So how much is this area? What's what's
the size? It must be 5%.
So a intersection b people who have a
dog and a cat or many dogs and many cats
are 5%
of students and uh this is exactly our
inclusion exclusion principle. Now uh
exercise
one C is much easier have a cat and do
not have a dog. So have a cat and do not
have a dog is this place right
only this without this overlap. So we
know that a is 15% this overlap is 5%.
So the answer is 10%.
And the last exercise 1d have a dog and
do not have a cat. uh 65% of people have
a dog only 5% of them have a cat as
well. So the answer is 60%. So the most
difficult part was uh the point B which
involves uh our inclusion exclusion
principle. Okay.
Exercise two the similar as it was on
the presentation. The students could
enroll in language courses Polish,
German, and Russian. 11 students
enrolled in the Polish course. Eight
students enrolled in German course. Six
in the Russian course, five Polish and
German. Four Polish and Russian. Three
German and Russian. Two students
enrolled in all three courses. How many
students in total enrolled in the
courses? We assume that they needed to
enroll at least at one of them. So how
many students is
the size of this union? And we know that
it is the size of A, the size of B, the
size of C minus the size of two uh sets,
the intersection of them, all
combinations and not A but B.
B and C
plus the intersection of all of them as
we uh already have seen at Vienna van
diagram.
So we want to know this.
Let's A be people who enrolled on Polish
course, B German and C Russian. So it
will be 11 + 8 + 5 -
oh uh 11 + 8 + 6 - 5
-
a and c is 4
- 3 + 2 and that's all we need to count
it.
8 cancels out with 5 and 3.
6 - 4 is 2 + 2 is 4 + 11 is 15.
And that's the answer. You could thought
that um this principle is a hard thing,
but as you can see, it's a simple
equation.
Exercise three.
In a school with 100 students, the
students could enroll in language
courses. They had to enroll in at least
one of them. Italian, Spanish, and
Portuguese. We have 100 students. And
again, how many students enrolled in one
second, third group, Italian and
Spanish? Italian and Portuguese.
Spanish and Portuguese. How many
students enrolled in all three courses?
So,
uh the same formula so I will not write
it anymore. It is 100 is = 72 + 50 +
38us
30 - 18 - 19
plus students that enrolled in all three
courses. So there's intersection of
those three sets. Okay. So 100 is equal
72 + 38 is 110
+ 50 is 160
- 30 and 18 is 48
and 19 is 5867
is equal for 160 - 67 is 93.
So this
unknown number must be seven, right?
Seven students enrolled in all three
courses.
And yes, this is such simple.
And the last one, exercise four. In the
new banking app, the bank has state that
each customer must choose a fourdigit
pin. But pins that contain three
consecutive identical digits are
considered invalid.
How many valid pins can customers
create?
And here we have two ways to compute
that. Let's use our new inclusion
exclusion principle. So we have four
digits
inclusion exclusion principle
four digits
a pin pins that contain three
consecutive identical digits are
considered invalid.
So in general how many pins there are
possible
in the first digit can be any of zero up
to nine digits. Zero is also okay for
the pin number. It is the same here,
here and here. So there are at most
10,000 valid pins but we need to exclude
some invalid ones. For example,
if we choose one digit here, one of 10,
it is for example five. Then if we set
five here,
the concrete number and five here,
concrete number, then it doesn't matter
what
number we put here, one of 10.
So here was 0 to 9 but we choose for
example five all those uh pins are
invalid
it is 100. It is similar situation when
we have for example
one of 10 digits here
we use the same digit in that place for
example seven and here seven and here
seven and it doesn't matter what we put
here
one of 10 digits it's also invalid pin
number
but in that case we counted twice a
situation. So invalid pin numbers are in
total let's say 200
but uh we counted twice situations where
four digits are the same. For example 0
0 0 1 1 and so on up to 9999.
We counted them twice as invalid
numbers. So how many there are n of 10
but here is the same here is the same
here is the same so there are 10 of them
right and we need to subtract them from
invalid ones so the total number of
valid numbers is 10,000
minus 100 they are invalid minus 100
they are invalid plus 10 because they
were excluded twice and this is 9,810.
This is the correct answer.
This was one way to do it.
But there is a second way.
We can use the rule of sum and the rule
of product.
role of sum plus the rule of product.
Again, we have
10 digits here, 10 digits here, 10
digits here, 10 digits here, at most
10,000
digits.
But we could count invalid ones in that
way to have disjoint sets. So invalid
ones are the one where we put any number
here any digit and this digit is the
same. This digit is the same but this is
different. So we do not use the same
digit like here is 555. So here n 0 to 4
or 6 to 9. Right?
Then
we have to exclude it situation when
here is any number any digit from 0 to
9. Here is the same here is the same but
here we do not repeat the same digit for
the fourth time. So we have nine
and we need to add situation because we
haven't counted it yet where all four
digits are the same. So here is n of 10
digits. Here is the same here is the
same. Here is the same. So the number of
numbers pins that we need to exclude is
90 + 90 + 10.
So it is 190. So the correct answer is
10,000
pins minus 190 invalid ones. It is
9,810.
So we counted it in two ways. One of
them is with disjoint sets and we just
use the rule of product here, here and
here and the rule of sum here and here.
Right?
There is no repeated situation in any of
those three sets.
All we can use we can don't care about
ensure that those cases don't overlap
and we just compute cases that we cannot
use where those three are repeated and
here is any digit.
Those three are repeated and here is any
digit. But some cases overlap. So we
need to count them as well and use the
formula for inclusion exclusion
principle. So we have two ways and many
times we can use two different ways and
the results must be then the same. Okay,
that's all in this chapter. See you in
the next one.
Hello. At the beginning of this course,
I mentioned that discrete mathematics
deals with sets that are equin numerous
with sets of natural numbers. We will go
over this information of what this equin
numerous city is. To compare the
cardinality size of finished sets, it is
enough to count the number of elements
in each set and compare these numbers.
We know this. Yes, we have two bags or
sets, right? In the first bag, there are
four elements. In the second bag, there
are five elements. Four is less than
five. So, there are more elements in the
second bag. Quite a simple rule.
However, we do not have the ability to
count the elements of infinite sets. But
this is also something that discrete
mathematics deals with because it deals
primarily with natural numbers. We can't
count all the natural numbers and see
how many there are, right? Because it
would take us exactly infinite time.
What therefore? Therefore, it would be
necessary to count the elements also in
these box in a different way. Another
way to compare the two sets can be the
childish method. This is my name for
this method which allows comparing sets
without knowing numbers. This child's
way is exactly the way a child 2 years
old, 3 years old at the most quite
small, completely unfamiliar with the
idea of numbers would be able to tell
that the number of elements in one set
and in the other set is the same. For
example, we give the child to check when
we make tableware that the number of
cups and saucers are the same. What does
the child do? The child puts the cup on
the saucer. the cup on the saucer. The
cup on the saucer fat crush the first
cup and saucer on the floor. Then the
second, then the third. And when it's
all broken, it will find that not a
single cup of saucer remains. This means
that the number of cups and saucers
turned out to be the same. Of course, it
is enough to put these cups on the
sauces to determine this. But if we add
the element of smashing on the floor, we
can additionally determine how many
saucers are missing. For example,
because there are two cups left on the
table, right? But this is already
ascertained by us. As I said, the child
does not have this knowledge of numbers
and at the time is able to determine
whether two sets are equal or not. And
in this way, we can also compare
infinite sets. Let's see that this way
works with an example with bags. We have
two bags. If the child were to determine
whether the number of elements is the
same, it would be enough for him or her
to tie such a golden thread between the
elements of one and the other bag. So as
to use all the elements in one of them
here in the first one, right? All of
them are and we find that some elements
from the second bag are still untied and
we no longer have no tight elements in
the first set from back one. This means
that there are more elements in the
second bag. Conclusion, the second bag
has more elements. So we don't need to
count the elements to determine whether
two sets are of the same size. If you
use all the elements in back one to bind
to the elements in back two and all the
elements in B two are used in this way,
then both bags would have the same
number of elements. What is lost here is
the information about how many elements
there are. But we know that there are or
they there aren't the same number and
that's often what we want to know if
it's the same not exactly how many right
also when we compare the numbers or on
which number is greater we don't need to
know by how much the question was which
one is greater so two sets or infinite A
and B are equinuous if every element of
set A corresponds to exactly one element
of set B and here is an assumption that
all the elements of set B have been used
that is you can't do in such a way that
with one chain from the back here we
connect multiple elements of the other
back so we cannot do this that is not
allowed and it's not allowed that an
element remains unbound in one back or
the other if either of these two
situations were happen. We do not find
equinuosity.
As elementary as it sounds, this is
exactly the definition of equinuosity.
Only it is more mathematical. Definition
of equin numerals of sets. Two sets or
infinite A and B are equinu if there is
a bjection between them. A one to one
and onto function. What does this even
mean? You don't need to understand it
because it's exactly the same as what we
wrote above. But in general, the
function means that from one element can
go at most one string. So like those uh
golden ones, right? From one element
goes only one string. So the situation
when for one element we connected two
strings is not a function at all. The
definition of function is precisely
that. It is a certain mapping that
assigns to each X which is precisely an
element of the source set at most one Y
which is at most one element in the
target set that is two strings can't go
because then it's not a function and an
one to one injection function means that
at most one string is also pinned to
each element. that is an onetoone
function is not a situation where this
element is pinned to two source
elements.
Right?
If that's the case that two source
elements are pinned to one target
element, it is a function at all because
two source elements can be assigned to
the same value but it is not an one to
one function. And the fact that the
function is so called on to more
professionally that it is also a
sjection means that we have used every
element from the target back or from the
target set and this is exactly the same
definition as we had before. They mean
exactly the same. So okay the
definitions are equivalent. The latter
is strict mathematical but means exactly
the same thing as the formula. The sets
are not equinuous. If such a function
such a matching does not exist, if we
are not able to connect all the elements
one to one, it means that the sets don't
have the same size. Not when we failed
trying to do so, but when there is
really no such possibility, right?
Example, prove that there are as many
even numbers as odd numbers. So if we
are able to connect in quotation marks
with a string every number from one set
to every number from another set, it
means they are identical number of
numbers. So the numbers simply need to
be paired. We have even numbers like 2 4
6 8 10 12 14 and so on. Odd numbers 1 3
5 7 9 11 13 etc. And we need to pair
numbers. Yeah. Solution. It is enough to
pair the numbers. One with two, three
with four, five with six and so on. That
is we pair this this number with this
one, this number with this one, this
number with this one and so on. Notice
that every even number has been used
exactly once and that every odd number
is used exactly once. Not only every odd
number was used but it was connected to
each number in even set. Yes. And that
means that these sets are equinumerous
that they have the same size. According
to the second more mathematical
definition, it would suffice to write
that we have a function that for a given
number n whereby it would have to be
written that n belongs to the set of odd
numbers.
So n belongs to odd numbers. This
function for any odd number is adding a
one because that's what we do. Changing
1 to 2 3 to four we add one. So because
there is a function that takes all
possible numbers odd numbers and we have
all possible even numbers on this side.
we have a function that is bjection that
are actually the same number of numbers.
Let's see if we had even numbers with
zero we would have exactly the same
situation. So we have zero here and like
we had this pairing 1 2 3 4 3 2 4 5 to 6
we would have 1 to 0 3 to2 5 to 4 7 to 6
and so on. So in the formula for the
function would be f of n is equal to
n -1.
So there are as many even numbers as
there are odd numbers whether or not we
take zero into account. Okay. So much
for the basic concept of equin numerous
equality of sizes. See you in the next
lesson.
Hello. Such a numerality equivalence in
cardinality is studied in set theory a
whole branch of mathematics. That's why
we cannot afford that is in this course
to focus on comparing sets because it
could easily become a cause in itself.
However, I've selected some sets which I
believe are worth knowing to be
equinumerous.
Sets that are either finite or are
equinumerous with the set of natural
numbers are called countable sets. We
also remember this from the first lesson
of the course that discrete mathematics
deals with such cases. We already know
what countable sets are, right? Those
that can be numbered using natural
numbers. Then can they can be numbered
completely.
theorem. The sets of natural numbers
with and without zero are equinuous.
Let's prove it. We have two such sets.
Let's call them n0 the natural numbers
including zero and n1 the natural
numbers starting from one. We construct
a sequence of pairs. So zero is
associated with one. One is assigned to
two or two is assigned to one. It
doesn't matter here. Two with three,
three with four. And so in fact we are
creating such a mapping that one is
assigned to zero, zero points to one,
one points to two, two points to three
and so on. We can see that we will
number all the elements in this way. All
elements from 0 to infinity will be
numbered with numbers from 1 to
infinity.
Exactly. Notice that each element from
n0 corresponds to exactly one element
from n1 and that every element from n1
will be paired. Therefore, these sets
are equin numerous. This completes the
proof. Yes, this proof is so simple.
There's no need to look for
sophisticated formulations.
Alternatively, we can define a function
a bjection that transforms elements from
set n0 to n1. That means we again take
all elements from the source set and
match them one to one with elements in
the target set. Each element in the
target set is paired with exactly one
from the source set. The formula here is
exactly the same as for even and odd
numbers. Why? Because when we go from 0
to one, then from one to two, we add
ones. It's just 1 + 1 + 1 forever,
right? F of 0 is 1. f of 1 is 1 + 1 2
and so on and so on. So this function
describes those arrows that I previously
put. In theory, we can write notice that
the function assigns exactly one always
distinct a value from the set n1 to each
element from n0 and that every number
from the set n1 is an output of the
function f. Therefore the sets are
equinian numerals. I put this in square
brackets because the word bjection
refers to this whole definition. We must
remember that when we use the word
bjection it means we assign exactly one
element not that we assign both one and
two to zero. And in reverse each each
one and two must be assigned exactly
once. Not that both zero is assigned to
two and two is assigned to two. Note
that means bjection every element is
used in both sets and each element is
used exactly once. So instead of writing
out the whole pairing we can just end
the proof here if we have used the world
byjection. Of course there is nothing
wrong with always creating a sequence of
pairs drawing lines or arrows and
writing that we are performing such a
pairing even without knowing a formula.
That's also always correct. Returning to
the point, let's notice that n1, the
natural numbers from 1 to infinity and
n0 which includes zero are equin
numerous and that is the conclusion.
Adding an element to an infinite set or
removing an element from an infinite set
does not change the size of the set.
What's more, adding or removing an
infinite number of elements from an
infinite set does not change its
cardality size. If we take the set of
natural numbers with or without zero and
add 100 elements to it, say 100 negative
numbers, the cardinality of the set does
not change. That's how it works for
infinite sets. If we add a number of
elements, the size of the set remains
the same. In other words, 100 elements
plus infinite set equals the same
infinity. And now an example from
outside discrete mathematics because we
are dealing here with continuous sets
not stepwise ones I mean between 0 and
one there are infinitely many numbers
but it nicely illustrates how it works.
So consider two intervals.
The set from 0 to one excluding 0 and
one and the set from 0 to 1 including 0
and one. And both are equinian numerals
that is the cardality size of set A
equals the cardality size of set B.
Let's prove that sets A from 0 to one
without 0 and one and C same as A but
with zero added are equinuous. If we can
do that then we can also add number one
right in the same way. First we add zero
adding one is done analogously. So to do
so let us split the set A into two
disjoint sets. A1 the set of fractions
with numerator one. So 1 second 1/3
1/4th
and so on. There is no one divided by
one because it is one and one is not in
set a and a2 the remaining numbers from
the set a. So for example in a2 there
are numbers like square root of 2 / 3.
It is in a it is in a2 of course as
well. So maybe write it that way. Also
27
is uh in a and a2. Right? Also logarithm
with base three of two is in a2.
So there are infinite numbers in a2 also
in a and only those are in a1. In the
same way, all these numbers I mentioned
belongs to the set B and to the set C.
And now we can define a function that
maps set A to set C. And this is a
bjection. The formula might look
complicated, but it's actually quite
simple. It says if we are dealing with a
number from the second set, we leave it
unchanged. That is the root of 2 by 3
corresponds to the number the root of 2x
3. If we take a number 1 second, we
assign it to zero. And for any other
fraction which is not 1 second from a1,
we assign it the fraction 1 by n minus
one. Which means 1 second becomes zero,
1/3 becomes 1 second, 1/4 becomes 1/3,
1/5 becomes uh becomes 1/4 and so on.
Let's see it. So we have set A
which has a lot of numbers like
this one like this one
like this one it is also in a
like I said logarithm
base three of two so three to what power
gives us two and there are those numbers
1 second 1/3 third
1/4 and so on.
Those are infinite many and those are
infinite many. We have set C which has
the same numbers
exactly the same numbers all of them
which I cannot write them all. And this
becomes this one. And this becomes to
this one. We assign the same number to
the same. But C also has zero and then
has also those fractions.
The first part is done. We connect all
numbers that are not those fractions to
themselves.
Now we assign 1 second to zero
and 1/3 3 - 1 is 2. So 1/3 we assign to
1 2 1/4 to 1/3
to 1/4 and so on. What have we written
that if x is f of x is let's say a
strange number then we just copy it over
this one maps to that one this maps map
to that one and so on and so on no
change if x is one two we assign it to
zero an additional number zero we are
now including zero if we are dealing
with any other fraction from the list
this list starting from 1/3 third we map
it to the previous one right so to one
uh 1/3 maps to one two one four maps to
1 three and so on and we can see that
all elements of set C including zero
have a corresponding element in set A
which doesn't include zero so indeed
adding an element or even an infinite
number of elements to an infinite set is
always possible okay if you got a bit
lost here that's okay too because we
won't be dealing with such so-called
continuous cases like sets from 0 to one
since discrete mathematics doesn't focus
on them but you can also try to show the
equivalence between C and B now between
sets C and B meaning add the number one
to set Creating
an analogous function or mapping just as
exercise and we will move on in the next
video.
Hello. Returning to the sets that
discrete mathematics deals with that is
countable sets. We have a theorem
stating that the set of natural numbers
and the set of integers are equals. For
every natural number including zero, we
define the following function. Again, we
are mapping natural numbers with zero to
the set of inteious. If we're talking
about zero, we assign zero to zero.
Right? For every even number, we divide
it by two. For every odd number, we add
one to it, divide by two, and then put a
minus sign in front. What does it mean?
That means that zero maps to zero. Zero.
If n is zero, the value is zero.
If n is one,
if n is one, n is odd. So 1 + 1 is 2 / 2
is 1 - 1.
If n is 2, n by 2 is 1.
The next 3 + 1 4 / 2 2 - 2 4 / 2 is 2
and so on. 5 will be -3. 6 will be 3. 7
will be -4 and 8 will be four and so on
of course. So what do we have here? We
can see that on the left we have natural
numbers and on the right integers and we
won't run out of natural numbers to
enumerate all integers. So they must be
the same size. Although this does not
change the fact that natural numbers are
indeed a subset of integers. Right? So
we can write that natural numbers are a
subset of integers. We have integers
and maybe put dots here - 5 -4 -3 - 2 -1
0 1 2 3 4 5 and so on.
And natural numbers are only those zero
or without zero. Right? Those are
natural numbers.
So natural numbers as a subset of the
integers because inteious include both
the natural numbers and their negatives.
And if we try to match natural numbers
with zero
in that way that we connect 0 to zero, 1
2 1 2 2 3 2 3 and so on
then we would run out of natural numbers
before we could number all the negative
ones. But note that the definition was
different. The definition said that if
we are able in any way, for example, by
reorganizing the elements of a given
set, here a set of integers not as 1 2 3
4 5 and the negative but uh 01
1 2 - 2 and so on. Negative, positive,
negative, positive. We can uh write down
all of them. If we are able to number
the set so relyarranged
set with natural numbers then although
the set of natural numbers is contained
in the integers they are the same size
and of course we have this uh diagram.
We know from the school that here are
integers and natural numbers are the
subset of integers.
But it doesn't change the fact that they
are as many as integers natural numbers
as integers. If it seems somehow
complicated to you, if you think that it
is a certain mishmash, this is true.
These concepts were created by Kantel in
the 19th at the end of the 19th century.
All of these things these social
assignments that we are actually doing
here were invented by Canel in the 19th
century. And so George Kle got tangled
up in here wondering how one set could
belong to another even though they have
the same number of elements etc. He also
proved that the set of rational numbers
is smaller than the set of irrational
numbers. Yet between any two elements of
the set of irrational numbers, there are
infinitely many rational numbers even
though there are fewer of them. And so
here, forgive the phrasing, he got so
tangled up that that he ended up
suffering from mental illness.
Specifically, Tanton face struggled with
depression and later his his psychiatric
condition prevented him from continuing
his work. So if this is difficult for
you, rest assured it was no easier for
its creator.
Okay, let's move on. This fairly
complicated proof with a function can be
written more simply. We can just create
pairing. We have rearranged integers and
we create pairs. The first number is
natural number 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 and on the
right we have integers all integers 0 1
-1 2 - 2 3 - 3 and so on. Notice that
not all numbers including zero is
contained within the integers yet every
integer has a corresponding natural
number. Therefore, these sets are equals
have the same cardality size. From the
fact that we know that sizes of natural
numbers with zero is the same as size of
natural number starting from one, we
conclude that the sets natural numbers
starting from one and integers are also
equinu.
To put it differently in the simplest
possible way, to avoid falling into
philosophical reflections that might
lead us to question the meaning of
existence, let's observe that we have
integers listed alternatively positive,
negative, positive, negative and so on.
We then number them. This is the first
number. This is second number, third
number, fourth number, fifth number,
sixth number, seventh number, eighth
number, ninth number and so on. So again
natural numbers are a part of integers
yet we have enough natural numbers to
number all integers and that implies
that they must be the same amount of
them. So we can see that we can write it
with arrows. Every integer number can be
assigned to natural number even though
natural number is a part of integers. So
we need separate two things containing
that one set is contained within the
other set. This one thing and different
thing is cardality. The sizes of
infinite sets those are two different
things. So we see a clear
correspondence. So no matter how much it
seems like there are more integers, this
isn't true. And it's worth remembering a
new definition. A given set is a
countable equals with the set of natural
numbers if it can be enumerated numbered
with natural numbers. Of course,
finished sets are all countable. And now
examples of countable sets. First
natural numbers with zero without zero
by definition are countable. The union
of these sets natural numbers and a set
A has the same cardality as natural
numbers. As we discussed add infinitely
many elements doesn't change a sets
cardality I mean for infinite sets the
set of integers because they can be
numbered the set of even numbers
similarly the set of odd numbers why
what does it mean theoretically events
should be half of natural numbers but
again we have natural numbers
we have natural numbers so 1 2 3 4 5 and
so
And we can number them with only even
numbers that are part of natural
numbers. So we can number 2 4 6 8 10 12
14 16. If we can number one set with in
quotes smaller set those sets are the
same size. The set of rational numbers
is also equin numerals with natural
numbers. Uh that is all fractions 1 2
1/3 5 6 whole numbers 5 - 5 etc taken
together have the same cardality as
natural numbers. We will see this in the
next lesson. The set of prime numbers
again because we can enumerate all
natural numbers with prime numbers. So
they need to have the same cardality.
And now examples of uncountable sets.
The set of real numbers. There is no way
to create a function arrows or numbering
that maps natural numbers to all real
numbers. It's impossible. This has been
proven. We cannot enumerate all real
numbers. The set of irrational numbers,
real numbers that aren't rational, is
also uncountable and moreover larger
than the set of natural numbers. The
interval from 0 to one on the number
line whether open or close any interval
in fact is uncountable. The set of all
subset of the set of natural numbers in
other words the power set of natural
numbers set of all subsets. This two is
uncountable. It cannot be numbered. How
we can imagine that? Let's say we have
only uh six natural numbers. So we have
0 1 2 3 4 5. Now from zero let's try to
write down all subsets of this uh set.
So we have single tones
0
1
2 up to five.
Then we have pairs
01
02
up to 45.
Then we have triples
and then we have four elements five five
elements in one set and the last element
is the whole set itself.
So when we have only six natural numbers
there is
uh this is uh so the size of this set is
six.
Let's say all those uh subsets are the
set a. The size of a is 2 to the^ of 6.
It's 64. So for six numbers, we have 64
subsets.
And when we take all the natural
numbers, infinite many, we have even
more infinite subsets and we cannot
match natural numbers with their uh all
subsets. Now two key terms and
notations. The cardality of the set of
natural numbers is denoted by the symbol
alf0 alf or alf0. In other words, there
are alf0 natural numbers. So a countable
infinite set is referred to as having
cardinality alf0. Alf is the Hebrew
letter, the first Hebrew Hebrew letter
as I remember and uh with the subscript
zero indicating it's the smallest
infinite cardinal. Uncountable sets like
the real numbers irrational intervals or
the power set of natural numbers are
collectively described as having the
cardality of the continum. This is
denoted in various ways at first
literature. So alf1 in fact assuming the
continum hypothesis but yes normally we
assume it this factor c for the
continuum two to the power of natural
numbers the set of natural numbers it is
this is how we put power set of natural
numbers 2 to the power of alf zero or uh
the size cardality of real numbers all
means the same uh assuming this
continuum hypothesis. So the set of
natural numbers represents the smallest
possible infinity in terms of cardality.
Every smaller infinite set has the same
size as natural numbers while the
continuum is the smallest possible
infinity that's larger than the first
one. And of course we can continue this
hierarchy. LF2, RF3, LF4. RF2 is the
smallest infinite set larger than RF1.
Will we be studying this? No, no, not in
this course. That's the domain of
advanced set theory. For our purposes, I
wanted to focus on certain fundamental
concepts. So, if you didn't grasp some
parts, don't worry. We won't be using
them. The key takeaways I want to
emphasize are there exist different
sizes of infinities. This is crucial.
Real numbers and natural numbers are
both infinite but they have different
sizes different cardality. And the
second thing what I wanted to emphasize
is set equinu with natural numbers are
called countable. And these are only
ones discrete mathematics deals with.
They are stepbystep collections like 1 2
3 and so on. Also 1 2 1/3 2/3 1/4 and so
on where between any two elements you
could theoretically insert many others.
Also important there are infinite sets
that aren't equal with natural numbers.
The real numbers being a prime example
but we won't be working with them in
this course. Discrete mathematics
doesn't deal with them. Finally, I
wanted you to remember how to recognize
when two infinite sets have the same
cardality. If you can pair all their
elements in one to one correspondence,
match them with arrows, then they are
the same size. If you take just one
thing from this lengthly lesson, let it
be this matching principle. If you have
understood more than that, I'm
absolutely delighted. See you in the
next one.
Hello. And now all that's left is to
show that the set of rational numbers is
countable. That is, it has the same
cardalinity as the set of natural
numbers. This isn't as straightforward
as it may seem. Finding a way to
enumerate the rational numbers isn't an
easy task. First, let's recap what we
already know. Two sets have the same
cardinality if there exists a onetoone
pairing between all elements of the
sets. That's our sauces and teacups
method.
Sets do not have the same cardinality.
Such a pairing does not exist. No, when
we cannot do that because we haven't
figured it out yet, but because no
matter how hard we will try, it's
impossible. Add infinitely many elements
doesn't change an infinite sets
cardality. Meaning if we add a infinite
number of elements, the cardinality, the
size of an infinite set doesn't change.
Now here's our case. If for two sets A
and B, A is a subset of B and you can
enumerate B using elements of A, then
the sets A and B have the same
cardality. So if A is a subset of B. So
we can think about it like A is smaller
in quotes smaller set. But with that
smaller set we can enumerate all
elements of bigger set then they have
the same cardity. Every infinite subset
of natural numbers is a queen numerous
with natural numbers itself. Meaning
it's countable. So the set of prime
numbers triangular numbers lucky numbers
happy numbers. Yes, such numbers exist.
Perfect numbers. All of these are subset
of the natural numbers. But since they
are infinite sets, they must be equin
numerous with the set of natural numbers
because the natural numbers are in a way
the smallest infinity possible. And now
at first glance the set of rational
numbers appears infinitely larger than
natural numbers. If we place the natural
numbers on a line 0 1 2 with zero here
up to 10 of course it goes on infinity
between any two natural numbers we can
insert infinitely many rational numbers
and the natural numbers themselves are
uh here marked with tiny yellow circles.
The natural numbers are also rational
numbers because every natural number can
be expressed as a fraction of that
number over one. So between any two
natural numbers we can put infinitely
many rational numbers and those natural
numbers are also rational numbers. So
how could we possibly enumerate these
rational numbers using natural numbers?
Yeah, natural numbers uh and inteious
are a subset of rational numbers.
Between any two inteious there are
infinitely many rational numbers. That's
what we already know from the picture.
And a numericity occurs if all these
rational numbers can be numbered. And
now let's try to achieve exactly uh
that. Let's try to enumerate all
rational numbers. There are several
proofs of this equity that the set of
rational number is countable can be
enumerated using total numbers meaning
they are of the same size. We will use
the diagonal method. This method goes by
different names, but we'll call it the
diagonal method because we are moving
along the diagonals. Here's how it
works. We create a table where where the
columns represent numerators and the
rows represent denom denominators. So
here are numerators and here are
denominators. We fill the table like
this. Here we write the numerator for
example one over the denominator one. So
it is uh one. here four
over three 3 over 4 and so on right
filling in all the elements so here is
two fifth here 66 which is exactly one
just like one over one and so on until
the entire table is filled I've moved
the table over so everything fits on the
screen first one over one is one 2 over
one is two 3 over 1 is uh We are just
rewriting those columns because the
denominator is one. Next, we divide each
numerator by two. Right? Here are
numerators and denominator is two. So
every of those numbers are divided by
two. Then by three, by four, by five, by
six and so on for all. This way we list
all possible fractions. Every
conceivable fraction appears in this
table because no matter what fraction
you think like 71s, you just go to
column 7 and row 11 and at the
intersection you will find 71s.
Similarly 11 7s so is found at column 11
and row 7. So indeed this table contains
all possible fractions. Right? There is
no fraction you can think of that
doesn't appear somewhere here. Those sum
appear multiple times. Now the diagonal
method means we will list these numbers
by following diagonals. So first this
diagonal I will try to
show it. Then the second one
then the third one.
Unfortunately, these diagonals aren't
perfectly even, but that doesn't matter.
I've uh colored uh them appropriately.
So, uh not here, it goes here, right?
And similar here. We will list them in
this order. So, first we have the number
one. We are moving diagonally through
the table. Next diagonal 2 and 1/2 the
following diagonal 3 and 1/3 I'm not
rewriting numbers that have already been
listed we are skipping duplicate next
diagonal then the next one and we can
continue this infinity you'll notice
that this way we listing all fractions
from left to right as we said whether
it's 7 117
or 177 seventh. They are all here. We
just need to reach column 100 and row
77. At some point they will appear on
some diagonal and will be included. In
this order we are listing all possible
positive fractions and simply we can
number them right all the fractions are
numbered now. So I just uh numbered it
by one, this by two, this by three, this
by four, by five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and so on. And
interestingly, we'll never run out of
natural numbers to enumerate all these
infinitely many possible fractions.
Right? Let's look back here.
Here for example these fractions 1/3
2/3 1/3 is here 1/2 is here 2/3 is here
no matter what fraction we imagine they
will eventually appear here so we have
successfully enumerated them all we can
enumerate all possible rational numbers
using natural numbers so they have the
same amount of numbers the same
cardality but wait there are more
rational numbers because we also to have
negative numbers and zero is also
rational number. But in reality just as
we have enumerated the positive ones
with natural numbers we could use
negative inteious to enumerate all
negative fractions and assign zero to
zero. Those for all rational positive
negative and zero. We can show equality
with integers and equin numericity
between integers and natural numbers is
already known to us. Okay. A few final
remarks. First, you could write a Python
program or use any other language that
implements this diagonal method to
locate any given fraction. For example,
user inputs 1 and six for 1 / 6. The
program responds it's the 17th number in
the diagonal enumeration. Like here, we
are only considering positives here.
user inputs
133 and 3 for 133 over 3 we return it's
the 725th
rational number the program would give
the position for any usual input
fraction or integer like like six
appearing in 12th position this is a
fascinating exercise I've included a
sample solution with the course
materials so you can check how I solved
Second, you can a little more about that
diagonal method. The diagonal method is
typically used to demonstrate unequal
cardalities between sets. In fact, the
same method proves that we cannot
enumerate all numbers between zero and
one using natural numbers. Meaning real
numbers have different cardality. There
are more real numbers than natural
numbers. And uh the proof is here.
it is uh done with diagonal diagonal
method. The proof shown here might be
slightly challenging but I believe you
are fully capable of understanding it.
So the diagonal method to serves to
prove either equinuosity or non
equinuosity of sets. Other things when
you go to cardinality page on Wikipedia
you will you will review everything we
have covered those arrows right that
that there is a bjection we can find
this information about alf null or alf
zero and continuum there is information
about George counter here so all the
information we uh we've got they are
here here are those informations uh that
uh I showed you already that in those
ways we can write cardality of real
numbers.
So all the information that uh we
covered are here. Of course there are
much more here so you can read about
them. Okay, that concludes this lesson.
I will see you in the next one.
Hello. Now we'll talk about the most
known popular subset of natural numbers,
prime numbers. Just a quick reminder
from school, prime numbers are natural
numbers greater than one that have
exactly two divisors, one and
themselves.
Examples of prime numbers 2 3 5 7 11 13
17.
Composite numbers are natural numbers
greater than one that have more than two
divisors. Examples of composite numbers.
Four is divisible by two. 6 by 2 and 3.
8 by 2 and 4. 9 by three and so on.
Theorem there are infinitely many prime
numbers. The proof was already provided
by around 300 years before Christ. To
prove that there are infinitely many
prime numbers, we can assume the
opposite that there are only many
primes. This kind of proof by assuming
the opposite is called proof by
contradiction. If there were only
infinitely many prime numbers, we could
list and number them. So two would be
the first prime number, three the second
one and so on up to n where n is the
largest prime number and k is its index.
Those p1, p2, p3, p4 up to pk would be
all the prime numbers in existence. We
could then construct a number that is
the product of all these primes. Meaning
the number L = 2 * 3 * 5 * 7 * 11 *
all price up to the last one. Or using
the notation for this price L is equal
to P1 * P2 * PK. The number L is
obviously a composite number and is
divisible by all the prime numbers. It's
divisible by 2 3 5 7 11 and so on up to
n.
Now let's consider the number m that is
equal to l + 1 that is one more than l.
What do we observe? m is not divisible
by two because l is divisible by two and
the next number divisible by two would
be l + 2. M is not divisible by 3
because L is divisible by 3 and the next
divisible number would be L + 3.
Similarly, it's not divisible by 5, 7,
11 or any other prime up to N. The
number M is greater than P K the last
one and it's not divisible by any of the
numbers 2 3 up to N. It has only two
divisor one and itself. We have a
contradiction. n must be a new prime
number. But this contradicts our initial
assumption that we had already listed
all primes. Therefore, our assumption
was false and there are infinitely many
prime numbers. Basic properties. There
are infinitely many prime numbers.
Although not every natural number is
prime, primes are a subset of natural
numbers, but there are infinitely many
primes. So they must be countable the
same size as natural numbers. We have
also indirectly proven that there are
infinitely many composite numbers
because every number L the product of
all primes up to some PK up to some n is
composite and since primes are infinite
so are such composites. Zero and one are
neither prime numbers nor composite
numbers. Zero is neither prime nor
composite. It has infinitely many
divisor. Every non-zero integer divides
zero. A divisor is of course a number
which divides a number without remainder
without fraction. One is also neither
prime nor composite. Its only divisor is
itself. Every composite number can be
written as a product of prime numbers.
Like 70 is 2 * 5 * 7. 100 is 2 * 2 * 5 *
5. There is only one even prime number
two. Every other even number is
divisible by two and two composite. All
other primes are of the form 2k + 1. For
every natural k 2k is even. So 2k + 1 is
odd and can be prime. For divisibility
by three primes other than three itself
must be of the form 3 k + 1 or 3k + 2.
Numbers like 3k or 3k + 3 are divisible
by three and those composite. For k more
than or equal 5, primes can only take
the forms 6 k minus one or 6k + one.
This is a useful property and we'll
explore it further later and prove it
later in one of the next videos. So how
to find prime numbers? One of the
simplest yet effective methods for
finding prime numbers is the so-called
sie of arastosinis.
Finding prime numbers using the seif of
arastoinesis.
We list all numbers from two up to some
limit here 100. This is the range we
want to search for primes. We mark the
first number that hasn't been crossed
out. This is two. Now we move in steps
of two. Four is no longer a prime
number. Six is no longer a prime number.
8 is no longer a prime number. And so on
here up to 100. I've marked them in
violet, but on paper they are usually
crossed out. Once we finish and reach
the end of the set, we take the next
number that hasn't been marked or
crossed out. This is three, which is a
prime number. Now we move in steps of
three. Six is already closed out, but 9
wasn't. 12 is already closed out, but 15
wasn't. And so on. Next, we take the
number five, which hasn't been closed
out yet, and move in steps of five. 10,
15, 20 were closed out, but 25 wasn't.
Additionally, we cross out 35, 55, 65,
85, and 95. Then we take seven and cross
out 49, 77 and 91. All the remaining
numbers, the unmarked ones are prime
numbers. But shouldn't we keep crossing
out further? No. Because once we've
reached a number greater than the square
root of the last number is in our set.
Here the square root of 100 is 10. All
the remaining numbers won't be crossed
out and they are already prime numbers
meaning they always were. We just now
know it. This leads us to an important
conclusion which we'll justify shortly.
To check if a given number is prime, we
don't need to try dividing it by all
natural numbers from two to one less
than the number itself. It is enough to
try dividing it by prime numbers smaller
than it from two to the square root of
the number. Justification, there are
numbers whose only non-trivial divisor
different than one and the number itself
is the square root. For example, 9 has
the only divisor three different than 1
and 9. These numbers are called square
numbers because 9 is 3 square. When
dividing a square number by its square
root divisor, we obtain the square root
divisor. 9 / 3 is 3. If there is a
divisor greater than the square root,
for example, 8 has a divisor of 4 and 4
is greater than the square root of 8.
Dividing will give a number smaller than
the square root because 8 / 4 is two.
Since dividing by a larger number gives
a smaller result. Right? Dividing by
square root gives us a square root.
Dividing by a larger number greater than
the square root always yields a smaller
result. So in fact to verify if a number
is prime it's enough to check
divisibility only by 2 3 5 and
subsequent prime numbers up to the
largest natural number not exceeding the
square root example is 101 prime 101
doesn't divide by two 101 is odd 101
doesn't divide by three a number is
divisible by three if the sum of its
digits It's is for 101. 1 + 0 + 1 is 2
and 2 isn't divisible by 3. So 101 isn't
divisible by three. 101 isn't divisible
by five because the last digit isn't
zero or five. 101 doesn't divide by 7
and that's all. At the end 101 is a
prime number. Right? This way we can
quickly verify if a relatively small
number is prime. In the next lesson,
we'll program these two key insights.
See you there.
Hello. Here we have the code of the
program I mentioned last time, which is
which number in the diagonal method the
specific rational number is. You can
review this program. I highly encourage
you to do so. And we move on to write
the algorithm for the program that
generates prime numbers. We can do this
in two ways. Using c of aristoines, we
can write a for loop for e in range up
to 1 million and generate all primes in
specific range here up to 1 million.
We can go of course from two because
zero and one are not primes. And the
second idea is to find a million prime
numbers. And then we write it in this
way. Why? Some list of primes is less
than 1 million.
Search for the next primes. So we are
looking much further than for a million.
We want the first million prime numbers.
So the last one will be more than 1
million. So in the beginning we need
some prime numbers. specifically at two
but I mean we can insert
two two and three two and three and five
those we know to be prime numbers
because we have to check the subsequent
numbers with them now the one to be
checked will be three so current will be
three and initially we can consider a
given number to be prime so is prime is
equal to true but it is not if it is
divided by some prime numbers we already
have. That is for any prime number for P
in primes.
If current is divisible by prime from
the list without remainder, it means it
is not a prime is prime is equal to
false and we break the loop. And now if
our condition in for loop never
succeeded it means that this prime is a
prime number. So we can add it to the
list. So primes
append
current one
and we need to increase the number we
are considering to be a prime now. So
current is three and what will be the
next one? All the primes except two are
odd numbers. So we can go with steps of
two. So plus equal two. Okay, we would
like to see if uh that works correctly.
So let's print
the first 100 primes and the last 100
primes.
We know the first ones like 2 3 5 7 11
and we know that the last ones it should
be minus
100. The last ones are bigger than a
million. We can try to run it
but we don't know how long it will work.
So we would like to break it
and we could print the current prime
number for example here. This is one way
and we can see that it is only 50,000
right? So it will take some time. Let's
decrease it to 100,000
primes
and we will see how long it will take.
It would be nice to see
the actual time that uh it took. So we
would write a time measurement in a
second.
It should be go farther than 100,000
uh number because uh we are looking for
100,000
primes.
So it is much bigger than 100,000 right.
So in a meantime we can write import
or from time import per counter
to measure the time. We can start
measuring time here. Start per counter.
And we can stop doing that after
printing those price. Stop per counter.
And we can uh print how long
did it take. So print
it took
stop minus start. Let's round it to two
decimal places
uh seconds.
Okay, we can see that this is correct,
right? 2 3 5 7 9 9 is not a prime
number.
Oh, we should have added this. This is
why maybe this uh uh loop was working so
long because we should add those uh this
number current number to primes only if
is prime is true. So if is prime
let's add it to the list right and then
add two and check the next one. Okay, we
would like to know how long does it take
and okay, it should end in some minutes.
I will be back when it finish.
Okay, now it's working. 2 3 571 and so
on. And the last prime is is 1,299,79.
Maybe we can write it down that the last
the last is like this. Maybe we can show
only the last 10. And it took
uh 7 minutes. 7 minutes and 16 seconds.
So this is a long time.
Okay.
And now we can consider how to speed up
the code. One of the properties of prime
numbers and this sie of elastosinis
was that we don't need to check every
prime number if it divides the current
considering number. We only need to do
so up to the square root of the number.
Right? So we can import from math
imports SQL data
import SQL T. It means square root
right. So we can write square root here.
Current square root is square root of
the current number. And if p is more
than the square root of this number, if
p is more than
uh current,
it means that none other number can
divide it. So
uh so we can put
break here and because square root um
and a float computation is not precise
we could do conversion to integer and
add one to this current SQRT.
So if square root from 9 is not three
but 2.99999
it still will work.
Okay we can check how fast the code is
now and if the the result is the same.
We can see that it speed up extremely
light.
So it is
3.12
second. So now now we can look for 1
million primes. So change it to 1
million. Run it again and it will be
quicker than 100,000 in a previous way.
So this is for
uh [sighs] 100,000 primes.
And the last is like this.
And now we will know how it is for 1
million primes.
Okay, let's check how fast it will find
uh 1 million primes.
So now it took 92.23
second.
And the last one is the last is 1,500
548,000.
Right?
Uh we need to check that. No, it is 15
millions 485,000
863.
This is the last one. Uh it should be
here. This is the minion prime number.
And the question is if we can speed up
it even more. Yes, we can. If you
remember, we don't need to check every
odd number like 3 5 7 9 11 and so on. We
can check only 6k minus one and 6k + 1.
Right? So instead of checking 3 5 7 9 11
and so on
we can check for k = 1 it is 6 - 1 is 5
and 6 + 1 is 7. The next ones uh 2 * 6
is 12 - 1 is 11 and 2 * 6 is 12 + 1 is
13. And we do not check nine at all. But
to do so, we need to change planes to B2
and three because this method with 6 K
-1 and 6 K + 1, it works from five and
more. So instead of having current, we
have K K = 6. We have two numbers
a = k minus one b = k + 1 and at the end
we change k + 6 6 12 18 and so on and 1
minus and one plus uh this k current
sqrt can be sqrt from the bigger number
and what is a current number to check we
can check we can Check current in A and
B. We have two numbers to check.
Okay.
Again is prime
equals to full prime in primes. If P is
more than current, SQLT will break. If
current divides by P equals Z is prime
false break. if is prime append and
that's all I think it's correct we will
see in a second and we will see how fast
it is now
so it should be much faster because we
do not check every odd number but only
pairs with steps that is equal to six.
Okay, let's check that.
We again have numbers and we see how
fast is it going and it is 72 seconds.
So 20 seconds less.
That's a lot. Of course, there are
better algorithms that this clean sie of
elastin is, but I wanted just to show
you how to find prime numbers in
specific range and and all primes
numbers up to some point and we should
uh see if the number the last one is
correct. It is and the
beginning ones are also correct. So uh
this new algorithm is also correct.
Okay, that's all in this lesson. See you
in the next one.
Hello. Now we will learn more about
prime numbers. First let's check that
indeed if P model equal 5 is a prime
number then P equals 6 K + or minus one
where K is any integer. We've already
checked that with a program, but let's
verify it with a mathematical proof.
Well, numbers in terms of division by
six can be equal to 6 * something. So, p
= 6 k and that is not a prime number
because uh it is divisible for example
by six. Those numbers are like 6 12 18
24 and so on. So, they are divisible by
6. 6k + 1 for example 7 which is 6 * 1 +
1 13 6 * 2 + 1 or 19 6 * 3 + 1 and for
such numbers we don't know if p is prime
we need to check it for every p for the
next case p = 6 k + 2 p is not a prime
number because 2 divides 6 k + 2 for
example for k = 3 we have 6 * 3 + 2 is
equal 20. So it is divisible by 2 and
we'll always get an even number. If p =
6 k + 3, then p is not a prime because 3
divides p. For example, let's take k 5.
6 * 5 is 30 + 33 and 33 is divisible by
3. This notation means that 2 divides p
and here 3 divides p. Similarly, a
number cannot be a prime if it's 6k + 4
because again 2 divides p. But 6 k + 5
could be prime. We don't know yet those.
Therefore, a number p can be prime only
if p = 6 k + 1 or p = 6 k + 5. However,
the numbers generated by 6 k + 5 are the
same as those generated by 6k minus one.
For example, 23 is 6 * 3 + 5, but also 6
* 4 - 1. Of course, the domain is
shifted for uh 1k because for 6k + 5,
the smallest number we can generate with
positive k is u 11. Uh but 6k + 5 for
positive k or zero is the same as 6 k
minus one for positive k. Thus indeed
the only possible prime numbers for p
more or equal 5 are of the form p= 6 k +
minus1 where k is positive integer. And
now we have this theorem. If p is a
prime number greater than or equal to 5
then 24 will divide p^² minus 1. It's
quite interesting that we don't have an
explicit formula for prime numbers nor a
fast method for generating primes yet.
All prime numbers from five upwards when
squared and reduced by one are divisible
by 24. The proof we can use the fact
that every prime p from five upwards is
in the form 6k + -1. K should be
positive integer here but let's imagine
it is written. So instead of p² minus
one we substitute p with 6 k + -1. Using
the algebraic identity first we have 36
k² then twice the first term * the
second keeping the sign then 1 squared
is 1 and -1 right so this one is from
this square and this minus one is
written we left with 36k squar + -2 k we
can factor out 12k giving 12k * 3 k + -
1 in parenthesis. Now this part is
divisible by 12. In fact 12 is obviously
divisible by 12. But for the whole
expression to be divisible by 24, it's
enough. If the second part 3 k or k * 3k
+ -1 is divisible by 2 when it is even,
then the number 2 minus 1 will be
divisible by 24. Yes, we know that 12 is
divisible by 12. It is enough to show
that two divides the rest. If K is even
then two divides K. So it divides
everything. We are finished. Then if K
is odd then K = 2 L + 1 for some integer
L. And for 3K + 1 because you know we
have plus or minus. Yes it is or it is
not plus and minus simultaneously.
So we need to check both. When uh there
is plus 3k + 1 uh we substitute k with 2
l + 1 and it equals 6 l + 4. So it is
divisible by 2. When it is uh 3k minus
one we again substitute k with 2 l + 1
and it is 6 l + 2. So again it is even.
So in either case 2 divides k * 3k + -1.
Meaning the entire expression is
divisible by 24 quarter at the most
random. Now maybe an example. Let's take
seven. It's a prime number. If we square
it and subtract one,
we get 49 - 1 which is 38 and 38 is
divisible by 24. If we take another
prime say 11^ squar - 1 it is 121 - 1 it
is 120 and it is again divisible by 24
because because 24 * 5 is 120. It's
quite surprising that all prime numbers
from five upwards satisfy this property.
Now there's fermat's little theorem. If
p is a prime number and a is an integer
such that a is not divisible by p then
we have this equation. It is congruency.
We will talk about congruences later. In
formal terms it leads a to the power of
p minus one is congruent to one model of
p. But in plain terms since we haven't
covered congruences yet we'll do it in
this section. A number a raised to the
power of p minus one leaves a remainder
of one when divided by p. Example 88 to
the power of 100. We can write it as
some number times 101 + 1. Here p the
prime number is 101 and any number that
is not divisible by 101. So for example
88 to the power of 1 minus so 101 minus
1 is 100. So any number to 100 that is
not divisible by 101 gives a remainder
one in this equation. Yes. So 88 to the^
100 leaves a remainder of 1 when divided
by 101.
In particular, any number not divisible
by three when squared leaves a remainder
of one when divided by three. At first
glance, this might seem like a minor
detail, but what the remainder of a
number is when divided by a prime, but
this is an extremely important theorem.
Next, there's Wilson theorem. It's an
interesting but inefficient method for
testing the primality of natural
numbers. with some theorem. A number P
is prime if and only if P minus one
factorial is congruent to minus one
modulo P. Which means a number P is
prime if and only if the factorial of
one less than P leaves a remainder of P
minus one when divided by P. Example,
the number five is prime because 5 - 1
is 4. 4 factorial is 24 and 24 / 5
leaves a remainder of four because it is
four fives and four. So the number like
five is prime if this number equals this
number and that's all. Another example 7
7 minus 1 is 6 factorial 720 and 720
divided by 7 leaves element of six and
again those two uh numbers are equal. So
seven is a prime number. This is also a
fascinating theorem. A seemingly simple
test in terms of notation. It is simple
but is highly inefficient in practice
because factorials grow extremely fast.
For instance, 101 factorial is an
enormous number making this method
impractical for primality testing or
even impossible. Another concept is the
pi of n function or symbol. Here pi does
not represent the number that is
approximately 3.14 but rather a function
that counts the number of primes less
than or equal to n. So for example uh pi
of 3 is two because there are only two
prime numbers up to three. It is 2 and
three. Pi of 100 is 25 because there are
25 primes up to 100. There's also the
prime number theorem which states the
number of prime numbers up to and
including n denoted by pi of n is
approximately n / natural logarith of n.
In other words, when we approximate pi
of n using n / natural logarithm of n,
the relative error tends to zero as n
increases. So the ratio of n and the
natural logarith of n which we can
compute instantly in python gives a very
important approximation for the
distribution of primes. This does not
mean that pi of n and this fraction get
closer in terms of absolute difference.
No, because pi of 100 is 25 and this
fraction is 21 approximately 2171
and pi of 10,000 is 1,229
and this fraction is,85.
So the absolute difference is smaller
here. Here is much bigger. It is obvious
we see that but though here the absolute
error is smaller but the relative error
percentage wise is actually larger in
that case but the prime number of
theorem is even stronger notice that the
second value is always smaller right 21
is smaller than 2585
is smaller than 2229
and in fact precisely for n more or
equal 17 an inequality holds
that this approximation is smaller. It
is always smaller but for n= 17 the
whole inequality holds. So this is
always smaller but pi of n is also
smaller than this approximation times
1.25506.
So we have a range of this pi of n
without calculating it. So yeah, if we
want to estimate roughly how many planes
there are up to a certain number, we can
simply divide n by natural logarithm of
n on scientific calculator. And we know
that for example for n= 10,000, we know
that it is something between 1,85 and
probably 1,400
without computing all the prime numbers.
Now two unsolve hypothesis as of today.
If you ever solve one of these, you will
probably become world famous. The first
one of the most important two hypothesis
in mathematics in general unsolve
goldbucks hypothesis or gold conjecttor
is unsolved mathematical problem with a
very simple formulation. Every even
number greater than two can be expressed
as the sum of two not necessarily
distinct plain numbers. That's all.
examples. 4 is 2 + 2, 6 is 3 + 3, 8 3 +
5, and 130 equals, for example, 101 +
29. And the hypothesis says that any
even number can be written as the sum of
two prime numbers. This hypothesis has
been tested programmatically using
Python. For example, it is known to be
true for numbers smaller than a
trillion, but it is still unclear
whether it is true always. And you can
certainly earn a handsome sum of money
for providing that it is always possible
to do so. All the disproving it showing
an example that there is an even number
that cannot be written using the sum of
two other prime numbers. And now a much
more important although more difficult
hypothesis is the reman hypothesis. It
is perhaps the most important hypothesis
in in mathematics. This is an unsolved
mathematical problem which states that
all zeros of a certain function the
lemon zita function lie either at
negative even integers called trivial
zeros or on the critical line in the
complex plane where the real part is
half. We haven't covered complex numbers
yet. If you know what they are, it will
be easier for you to understand the
hypothesis. A full course on them could
be made. I really like them. So maybe
one day. Tell me if you want such a
course. The za function uh formula is
this. Whatever it means, we know that we
can write those elements of uh this
infinite series. Plugging in numbers 1 2
3 etc. for n right we know that and the
big mistake is we don't know whether all
the zeros so as complex numbers gives
zero for that function if only the real
part equals to a half right even if you
don't fully grasp the math here it
doesn't matter we we are not going to
solve the hypothesis now because all
mathematicians combined most much much
better mathematicians than me professors
of mathematics
can't tell if it's true, but we know
that it's very important. Namely, if the
lemon hypothesis is true, then the value
of the prime counting function pi of n
can be approximated with much greater
accuracy. Moreover, for every number x
more or equal to if the remman
hypothesis is true, there is always at
least one prime number p in the interval
x - 4 / p * square of x * natural
logarithm of x p and x. Yeah. So, so in
the interval of this number and this
number there is always prime number P
here a pi is normal pi number so
approximately equals 3.14.
So the first part this uh greater
accuracy we know we remember that we
used this approximation but we see that
it is not too much accurate. So for
10,000 we have 1,229
and approximation is between 1,85 and
maybe 1,400.
And with this theorem, if hypo rear
hypothesis is true, we can approximate
this between probably 1,200 and 100
1,250.
Right? So this is crucial. And for the
second part, if the remaining hypothesis
is true, for X= for example 10,000, for
X= 10,000, it means that there must be P
prime number that it is smaller than
10,000,
not equal even because 10,000 is not uh
prime and something like 7,900
as I recall intuitively. V. We know that
this is more or less the case, but it is
also a very important implication. I
mean, we know that this is more or less
the case for the numbers we checked.
Yes, up to the minions prime number
because we can check it with a program.
But whether this is the case for very
large ones, we don't know. This is the
case if the lemon hypothesis is true.
And so from the simple fact of what
prime numbers are, prime numbers are
those that divide only by one and
itself. We ended at the limon
hypothesis. The most important unsolved
problem in math with huge consequences.
And there are also many other
implication of this hypothesis. Okay,
see you in the next lesson.
Hello. Now we will talk about GCD and
LCM concepts we mostly already
encountered in elementary school but of
course in a very limited way. The
greatest common divisor GCD of two or
more integers is the largest positive
integer that divides each of them. For
example, if we need to find the GCD of
140 and 180, we can list the divisor of
140. all the numbers that divide 130 and
the divisor of 180. All the numbers that
divide that number. Then choose the
largest number that appears in both
lists. And that number is 20. So the
greatest common divisor of 140 and 180.
The largest number that divides both
without a remainder is 20. Such a number
always exists. In the worst case, it's
one. Now the least common multiple LCM
of two or more integers is the smallest
number that is divisible by each of
them. If we need to find the LCM of 140
and 180, this time we list the
multiples. So we count by 140 140 280
420 560
700 840 and so on and the multiples of
180. and we look for the smallest number
that appears in both lists. And that
number is 1,260.
Here too, such a number always exists.
So the least common multiple of these
two numbers is 1,260.
There is a formula that states the
product of numbers A and B is equal to
the product of the GCD and LCM. Using
this formula, it is enough to compute
only one of the values either LCM or GCD
mostly GCD and the other can be found
automatically. And for our example, we
could calculate GCD it is 20 and then
automatically use the transformed
formula. One number times the other
divided by GCD. We plug in our
calculated GCD, simplify 120, which
gives us 7, and the result is 7 * 180,
which is 1,260.
So, it's always enough to calculate one
of them, and we automatically get the
other. Very important note, this formula
works only for the two integers. Finding
the greatest common divisor or least
common multiple of three or more numbers
can be reduced to repeatedly applying
the two number version. For GCD of three
numbers A, B, C, we first calculate the
GCD of A and B inside the inner
parenthesis and then we take the GCD of
that result and C. Meaning we substitute
the result here. Similarly for LCM, for
example, if we need to find the LCM of
the numbers 3, four and five, the least
common multiple of these three numbers,
we first find the LCM of 3 and 4, which
is 12. It is the smallest number that
appears in the multiples of both three
and four. Then LCM of 12 and 5 is 60. In
reality, we don't find GCD or LCM by
listing all devices or multiples and
searching for the smallest or largest
number. At least not for numbers larger
than 100 because that would simply take
too much time. However, there are better
methods. There are three basic methods
for finding the GCD and LCM. The listing
method, we've just seen this one, is
good for small numbers. small numbers in
quotes because it can work for some
large numbers like a million and 2
millions. The GCD is a million and the
LCM is 2 million, right? But in general,
the smaller the numbers, the more
practical this method is. The school or
column method. This is the one we most
of us learned in school. You might have
forgotten it, but we'll recall it now.
It's good for numbers of a normal size.
let's say between 100 and 10,000 and
there is a algorithm this method works
well for all numbers with this algorithm
we can always quickly find the GCD and
LCM so in principle knowing just this
third method is enough to determine GCD
and LCM for any two numbers we already
know how to find the GCD and LCM of 140
and 180 by listing the divisor and
multiples in the score method we Write
140 on the left and find its smallest
prime divisor which is 2. 140 divided by
2 is 70. 70 divided by 2 is 35. The
smallest number that divides 35 is 5. Uh
it is seven and the smallest number that
divides 7 is 7 because 7 is prime
number. And we do the same for 180. We
divide by smallest numbers that they
should be always prime numbers. In fact,
this order is not so important. But by
performing this action just by the
smallest first divisor, we are basically
sure that we are performing it by first
divisor at all. Because we could
potentially 180ide by 6, forgetting that
six is not a prime number. But on the
right, there should be prime numbers
only. To find GCD, we mark the numbers
that appear the same number of times on
both sides. So two twos and one five.
That is if the second number 180 had
three twos, we would also mark two of
them only because we have two on the
left. The GCD is the product of the
marked numbers. So it is 2 * 2 * 5 which
is equal to 20 because only this are
marked in any of the columns. To find
LCM, we take one of the numbers and
multiply it by the unmarked numbers on
the other column. So it can be 180 * 7
because 7 is unmarked on the left or 140
and two threes because uh three and
three are not marked on the right. And
we have Oakit's algorithm. It works by
expressing the larger number as a
multiple of the smaller one plus a
remainder. So 180 it is
140 + 40. Then we need to do the same
for 140 and 40. 140 is 340s
+ 20. 340 because four 40s would be more
than 140. So it is 340s + 20. And again
in the next step we take only these two
numbers that appears after
uh product symbol. Yes, only those
numbers always. that is 40 equals to 2
20s + 0 and that's basically it. And now
the GCD is as much as the last mark
value before zero which is 20. This is
the fastest method. We can't directly
compute LCM using Elit's algorithm. But
we can use the formula A * P= GCD * LCM.
Interestingly in Elit's algorithm we
know in advance the maximum number of
steps required. It does not exceed five
times the number of digits of the
smaller number. For 140, it is three
digits. The maximum steps would be 3 * 5
equals 15 steps. In reality, I algorithm
can be optimized further to reduce the
number of steps. If you are interested,
you can find more details on Wikipedia
under GCD greatest common divisor. In
the next lesson, we will solve a few
problems.
Hello. I've prepared three exercises
here to review the GCD and the LCM and a
bit of prime numbers. At the same time,
all these exercises come from math
books. So, they really do occur in real
tasks. And let's move on to the first
problem. The product of the seven grades
Jane has on the on her report card is
112,500.
What grades are these? So exercise one,
we have seven grades.
Let's name them from A to G.
And the product of them is 112,500.
And we assume that grades are from 1 to
six when the one is the lowest grade and
six is the best. So A B C D E F G
are in this set one two up to six.
And normally we can't solve this. Why?
Because we have seven unknowns and only
one equation in real numbers. We
wouldn't manage it. But we know these
are natural numbers because they are
great and even specific natural numbers
since all these numbers up to G
inclusive from A to G are from the range
of 1 to six. And how to solve this
problem? Of course, there are several
ways. As always, you can try to do each
of these problems yourself and then just
check whether you got the same answer as
I did. One of the ways is to break
112,500
into plain factors because we want
factors anyway. So we write this
maybe more space for that.
uh divide by two it is 56,250
and uh divide by two as many times as
possible. So 28
125. Now for three
we have to check the sum of the digits.
2 + 8 is 10 11 15. So it is uh divisible
by 3.
And now to get 28 9 * 3 is 27.
So it will be 9. And I guess we can't do
it without a calculator here. So let's
open it.
28
125 divided by 3 is 9,375.
9,375
again uh by 3 12 19 24 so it is
divisible by 3 again it is 9 by 3 is 3 3
by 3 is 1 and 75 by 3 is 25
4 6 11 is not divisible by 3 the sum is
not so the number is not so we divide it
by five
and it is Yes, I think 625
3,125
right by 525
by 5 is 25 by 5 is 5 and by 5 is 1. So
we can write that 112500
is a product of those numbers. So
2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 1 2 3 4 5 5s
3 4 and five we have nine numbers to two
2 three and five fives and we were
supposed to have seven but this is
multiplication some numbers we can
multiply together we can't multiply two
and five because it will be 10 and 10 is
not in our that similarly 3 * 5 is 15
and and 15 is also too much for us. But
2 * 3 is 6 and there is a great six. So
we can
multiply 2 and 3 it will be six and this
two and three it will be six. And then
we will have seven marks. Six and six
and five and five and five and five and
five. Seven marks. So we know uh grades
that Jane has. And that's it. Okay.
Problem two. Exercise two.
Calculate the GCD and LCM of the
numbers. It is 1,146,9992
and 9990.
We will use the alidine algorithm. So we
are looking for the GCD of those two
numbers
and to find it we'll uh write the
algorithm.
So
the bigger of them is equal to how many
times this number fits in this one. It
fits only once because two times this
number is bigger than that
plus some rest. So this number minus
this will give us the rest. 2 - 2 is 2.
99 - 99 is 0 0.
And now we have 6 - 0 is 6. And 114 - 99
is like 115 - 100. So it is 15. And now
we will take those two numbers. So 99 9
0 9 0 equals to
something times
uh this number
plus the remain and how much this fits
in this number 6 * 15 is 90,000 so it
will be 6
but now we will uh just use the
calculator
so 6 * 15 6 02 is and minus No 980 980
it is 50 of course with plus 54,978
54,978.
Now those two numbers
0002 is equal to
54978
* 3 it will be more than 156,000 so it
is 2 and we'll check again with the
calculator.
So 2 * 54
978
and -
156002
is 46,000
46.
Now it is easier.
This number is only one. This
plus
78 - 46 is 32. 9 - 0 is 9 and this is
8,000. And quickly from millions we have
thousands.
Now 46,046
is
and if we don't know how much the number
fits in another we can just divide it
right. So we can just write
46,046
divided by 8,932.
Oh I put one. again
divided by 8 932 and it is five and just
like that we put this number times five
and
minus
this number. So it is 1,386
1,386
and five here. Okay,
we are borrowing folder.
We are using calculator again.
8 932ided
by 1386.
It is 6. 6 *
1386 is 8,316.
And it is easy to subtract.
It was 6 and 616.
Now 1,386
is
something times 616.
It is 2 because it will be 1,200.
1,232.
So we need four. We need five. 1,200.
So it is 154 and 616
is 4 * 154 and this is exactly 616
so plus zero and the last number before
zero or this repeated number is
154.
So GCD of those two numbers is 154. What
is this for? Well, if we had a fraction
one number over another,
all the one number over the other all
the uh other way around. So, we have
1 1 4 6 92
and
99
0990.
Now we know that we can uh divide both
by
154 instead of reducing by two by two
and then don't know how to reduce this
we can just reduce it by 160
154.
So it is 1,146,992
divided by
154 is 7,438.
And similarly
divided by 154 is 6,435.
And those fractions are irreducible. So
that's the final form. Okay. Exercise
three. Oh, uh not not yet. We have to
compute LCM.
But it is easy because um this number
times this number.
And we can write it here
times 9 0990.
It is the same as 154* LCM
LCM of those numbers. Right? So you just
need to uh
compute the product and divide it by
154.
So LCM of those numbers
is the same as 7448
7448
times
this number. Okay. So exercise three
maybe here.
Exercise number three.
We don't know what are the numbers A and
B, but we know GCD and LC M of them. We
can use again this type of method. So we
don't know what is a but for sure there
is two
and there is five
in prime factors and the same with b
because it is gcd. So there is two some
numbers and five for sure.
And we know that a * b is the same as
gcd
a and b time lcm a and b.
So a * b is 10 * 100 which is 1,000.
1,00 is
um we can divide it by 10 by 10 and by
10.
So it is
10 * 10 * 10. Uh but we know that
uh 2 and 5 are divisor. So a is equal to
10 times some other number. And the same
with B. It is 10 times some other
numbers. So
like that
we can divide by 10 * 10.
Let's say this way.
And those number that we are missing
in product is 10. So it is 2 * 5. So
somewhere is two, somewhere is five.
Maybe it is two here and five here. And
it will be GCD of numbers 10 and LCM of
numbers 100. Maybe a has two and five
and LCM does not have them or this way
or five is here and two is here. So we
can write the answer that
a = to
2 * 5 but b = 2 * 5 * 2 * 5.
A is = 2 * 5 is 2 * 5 and B is equal to
2 * 5
or
A is equal to 2 * 5 * 2 but B is equal
25 2 * 5 * 5 or A is equal to 2 * 5 * 5
and B is equal to 2 * 5 * 2 and uh they
are the only possibilities.
Okay, we fit to the one page. That's
great. And see you in the next lesson.
Bye.
Hello. Now you will learn about
co-primes. Two natural numbers are
called co-prime not co-primes here
because co-prime is the relation between
two natural numbers. So two natural
numbers are called co-prime relatively
prime if the only common divisor is the
number one. And examples 16 and 9 both
are not primes but they are co-prime
because the only common divisor between
16 and 9 is one. Similarly 15 and 8 and
7 and two. It is uh like always this is
a simple definition with extremely many
properties and even more applications.
So numbers a and b are co-rime if and
only if they gcd is equal to one. Two
prime numbers are always co-prime. Two
consecutive natural numbers are
co-prime. So 7 and 8 and 9 and so on
they're always co-prime. A fraction a by
b where a and b are co-prime is
irreducible.
For any two different natural numbers a
and b there exist infinitely many
natural numbers n such that the greatest
common divisor a + n and b + n is equal
1. Maybe mark here that gcd is often
written without this gcd. So it is often
written as just parentheses
and some numbers and it also means GCD
but in this course we will write GCD
always. A prime number is not co-prime
only with its multiples. So 7 is
co-prime with all natural numbers except
7 14 21 and so on. The number one is
copying with every positive natural
number and plus means positive natural
number in any sequence of nine
consecutive natural numbers. This is
inter interesting. There is always at
least one that is copying with all the
others. It is not the case when there
are eight consecutive natural numbers.
But when there is nine consecutive
natural numbers, there is always one of
them is complying with all the others.
LCM of a and b is equal a * b when the
numbers a and b are co-prime. This is
important when we have two fractions
13 and 17th. We don't need to compute
LCM to find the common denominator but
just uh multiply this 3 * 7 is 21. 3 * 7
is 21. This is 7. This is 3 and it is 10
21. Okay. numbers a and b are co-prime
if and only if there exist two integers
x and y such that the equation ax + b y
is equal 1 is satisfied. So for numbers
like 2 and 8 that are not coine because
uh they are divisible by two. We cannot
find two x and y integers that the
equation is satisfied. But for co-prime
it is and if we can get one we can get
any other number because uh we can do it
multiple times and then get two three
and so on.
Numbers 2 to the power of a minus one
and 2 to the power of b minus one are
cop prime if and only if the numbers a
and b are cop prime. This is what I have
told you. By adding or subtracting some
number of co-line numbers, we can obtain
any natural number. And here we have a
popular puzzle. You can you probably
heard about it in some form. Given two
containers, one 5 L, the other 3 L units
doesn't matter here. Is it possible to
measure exactly 4 L of water? Is it or
not? The containers have no markings. So
we need to use the whole container and
we can spot that five and three are co
prime. So we should maybe it's not the
case because we because we cannot exceed
8 liters here but we should get every
number from 1 to 8 and uh we can draw
this. So we have five liters here
and three liters here.
And we can uh fill pour water here to
the full container
and uh pour this water here. So it will
be three liters here
3 lit and um this uh container container
will be empty. So we have the situation
like here is 3 L of water.
The whole containment is container is 5
L and we have the second container 3 L
and we can again pour this container
fully
and it will be and we can again pour
this water here. So we can only pull 2
liters
right? It will be full 5 lit and here
will stay one liter because we pull two
liters here.
After that we have
we can pull uh out this water. So we
have clean five liters here and we have
one liter here.
We pour this water here.
We have five liters container and filled
with one liter. The other container we
pour with water 3 liters
and pour it here. And then we will have
this one liter and those three liters.
So it is four liter.
Okay, that's it in this lesson. See you
in the next one.
Hello. Now we are going to learn about
congruences which I already mentioned
earlier in this course. Now we will see
exactly what they mean. A congruence or
modular arithmetic is a certain
relations between two integers. Namely,
if number A and number B when divided by
number n give the same reminder, then we
say that a is congruent to be modulo n.
When n is known, for example, fix it
within a problem, we briefly say a is
congruent to b. So here is an example.
When we divide 17
by 6
uh not as a fraction we can simply write
that it is 2
remainder five.
This is exactly the same as if we wrote
it as a fraction in this way. Uh like
17 / 6 is 2 and 56.
Right? Also 11 / 6. Also 11 / 6 gives us
remainder five. Six ft once in 11. So it
is one remainder five or here
we can write it as one and five six.
Since the remainder is the same this
five is the same here and here when
divided by the same number n here six we
say that 17 and 11 are congruent are
congruent to each other. That is 17 is
congrent to 11 modulo 6 meaning they
give the same remainder or in a flection
notation they give the same numerator in
a mixed number. This works fine for
positive numbers. For negative numbers
we can also consider congruences
reminders but it's harder to write it in
a fraction form. We cannot really say 1
and - 56.
I mean that's not the default way but we
will focus on positive numbers in this
course and so the notation
a triple equals b mod n we read as a is
congruent to b modulo n. For example 17
is congruent to 32 modulo 3 because when
divided by three both numbers leave the
same remainder namely two.
17 / 3 is 5 remainder 2. 32 / 3 is 10
remainder 2. We can write it like I said
or we can write it in that notation that
17 is some numbers of threes plus two.
Two is the remainder and 32 is some
number of threes plus two as well. And
those two are remainders, right? So uh
so 17 and 32 are congruent because they
have this number the same when we have
three and three here. As for the word
congruence, it was introduced by Gaus.
It comes from Latin and it means harmony
or agreement. And here it is uh an
agreement equality of reminders, right?
Reminder two and reminder two. That's
why uh we call it congruence. Now about
this notation, in fact in different
books it may appear with different
definitions but they are equivalent.
That is the three definitions I will
show now are all equivalent but in a
given textbook it may be introduced in a
different way. So let's look at all
three numbers A and B have the same
reminder when divided by N. That one we
already know. Another definition there
exists an integer k such that a equ= k *
n + b. We have seen this here right this
notation 17 = 5 * 3 + 2 32 = 10 * 3 + 2.
Uh but now we say that 17 is congruent
to 32
when we can write 17 equals some k
integer k * 3 + 32. If we can do that
those number are congruent to each
other. So for example
for 17 and 32 a modul 3 means that there
exist k such that 17 equals k * 3 + 32
and indeed for k that is -5 k is an
integer right so it can be negative we
have 17 = -5 * 3 it is -5 and -5 + 32 is
17 so we can write it in that way. If we
can write in that way two numbers that
are congruent modulo the this number
right k * this number okay this is the
second definition so if two numbers are
congruent modul of the same number then
such a k exists there is a third
definition the number a congruent to b
modulo n means that a minus b and b
minus a it doesn't matter is divisible
by n without remainder. So n divides a
minus b or n divides b minus a. For
example, for the 17 and 32 modul 3 means
that 3 / 17 - 32 it's -5. So it really
divides and 3 divides 32 - 17 it is also
15 but positive one. So these three
equivalent definitions are commonly
encountered. Each one implies the others
and now as usual simple thing like
congruence has many probabilities. This
is the obvious one. So 5 is congruent to
5. 7 is congruent to 7 and in fact it
doesn't matter what n equals to it must
be positive integer. Uh here a b c d are
integers
and m and n are positive integers. So n
cannot be uh negative or zero. If one
number is congruent to another then the
second one is congruent to the first
one. Transitivity.
If the first is congruent to the second
and the second to the third then the
first is congruent to the third. Modul
the same l. If two numbers are
congruent, then if we add or subtract
the same integers to both, they will
still be congruent. If a is congruent to
b, then multiplying both a and b by some
c gives ac is congruent to bc. So they
keep the same reminder. Always keep this
in mind. A modular means they have the
same reminder. If a is congrent to b and
c is congrent to d modulo n then a plus
or minus c is congrent to b + - d here
respectively a + c matches b + d or a
minus c matches b minus d. The next
property that we can multiply
a by c and b by d if a is congrent to b
and c is congrent to d. The most
important property for us if a is
congruent to b then rising both sides to
the same positive integer power m
preserves congruence. And the last
property two numbers are congruent
modulo sum product then we can cancel
factors. You can see that normally we
haven't changed this uh numbering modulo
but if we want to divide it by a here a
here and a is here we need to divide all
of a great to summarize congruences can
be added 10 wise subtracted 10 wise and
multiplied 10 wise with the same modulus
in general congruences cannot be divided
Tell wise we can see it from the ninth
point. But to show it for example we
have four is congruent to 12
modulo 4.
Why? Because four when divided by 4
gives uh remainder zero and 12 divided
by 4 gives remainder zero. And we cannot
divide it it in that way that here is
one here is three and modulus uh
preserves four because now one divided
by 4 gives the remainder 1 and 3 / 4
gives the remainder three. So we cannot
divide uh in that way. So in general we
cannot divide congruences on both sides.
But we can use uh the nine point here
and we can add, subtract, multiply, add
and power all uh numbers. All right, we
will do examples in the next lesson. See
you there.
So we have these nine properties and
let's try to solve a problem. Example
problem. Prove that the number 107 to
the power of 95 minus 133 to the power
of 37 is divisible by 10. Now
divisibility by 10 numbers when divided
by 10 give a reminder equal to the last
digit of that number module 10 to the
given power. In the other words 107 to
the^ of 95 is congruent to 7 to the
power of 95. This is true specifically
for modulo 10. When dividing by 10, 100,
1,000, and so on, it is enough to look
at the last digits, the same amount of
digits as there are zeros in 10 to 100,
1,000. So, it is enough to look at the
number formed by the last few digits for
10 only one. Now let's see 7 to 95
equ=
7 to power of 4 to 23 * 7 to the^ 3.
This is because exponents multiply
right. Uh here 4 * 23 is 92
and uh those powers we add them. So it
is 7 to the power of 95. still why to do
it this way? Because 724
is 2,41
and the last digit is 1. So 107 295 is
congrent to 7 295 is congrent to 2,41
because this is 7 to the^ 4. 22 3 * 7 to
3. And again we can omit those three
digits. We only need the last uh digit.
So that's one. And one to every natural
power is one. So this is congruent to 7
to the^ of 3 which is 333.
So it is congruent to three modulo 10.
So full out. We were just checking the
last digit because we are checking the
remainder modulo 10. Also the next
number 133 to the power of 37. Again we
can consider 3 to the^ 37. We do the
same trick uh because 3 to the^ 4 is 81.
So we have 1 to 9. It is one. So the
last digit is three. And that's
basically the end of the problem. How
so? We were supposed to prove that the
difference of those two numbers is
divisible by 10 and the combination of
the first.
Let's go back. Uh of first and the third
definition tells us if a and b have the
same remainder when divided by n in this
case both powers give reminder 3 modulo
10. then it means that 10 divides the
difference. So here the number modulo 10
gives remainder three and here the
number modulo uh 10 gives remainder
three. This can actually be reached
without modular arithmetic just by
looking at the last digit because when
you multiply 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 * 7 last
digit will start to repeat. So we can
predict that the last digit will be
three. But okay it gives the same result
three and from modular arithmetic we
know if two numbers have the same
remainder and then their difference is
divisible by that modulus. And note here
integers when divided by n can yield one
of the remainders from zero to n minus
one. So if dividing by 10 the remainder
can be 0 1 2 and so on up to 9. So there
are 10 possible remainders for modulo
10. Why 10? Because up to 9 minus one 10
- 1 is 9 but from zero we include zero.
That's why 10 possible remainders. That
means that for any number a we can split
it into n groups. A = N K or NK + 0 A =
N K + 1 + 2 and so on + N -1 for example
22 is 2 * 10 + 2 right when we have
fixed n every number we can present in
that way notice when talking about
remainders modulo n * k is divisible by
n so its remainder is zero row. Here the
remainder is one. Here the remainder is
2. And here the remainder is n minus
one. But n is also divisible by n. So
remainder is -1. Right? So n minus one
is congruent to minus1 modulo n. So for
10 we can write remainder 9 as -1. It's
the same thing. That's why we can say a
can be equal to 6 k + 5 or a is equal to
6 k minus one. It's the same thing. Of
course, if we consider k as any integer
number because 5 is congruent to minus1
modulo 6 by this formula n is 6. So here
is five and here is minus one or any
another number as um 6 k + 4 it's the
same as 6 k -2. Of course if we talk
about modulo 6 because dividing by 6
leaves remainder four or remainder
minus2 and so on. If that seems strange
look back at the second definition.
there exists an integer k such that a =
k * n + b. So for example 11
is equal
1 * 6 + 5 or 11 is equal 2 * 6 -1
and we when we talk about remainders
congruency + 5 and -1 modulo 6 is the
same and here we have uh the same for
five and minus one so they leave the
same remainder five okay That's all in
this lesson. See you in the next one.
Of course, you can try to solve them
without using congruences. In fact, you
can always do them without congruences.
For example, by trying to directly
calculate something like 2 to the power
of 20 - 1 here. But what we want here is
to make use of the knowledge we have
just gained.
So let's start with exercise one maybe
here. Exercise one
prove that for any non- negative integer
n the number 3 to the power of 4 to the^
of n we first need to compute 4 to the
power of n + 23 is divisible by 13.
Let's check it for some small n.
If n is zero, then we have 3 to the^ of
4 to the^ 0 + 23.
4 to the^ 0. Everything to the power of
0 except maybe 0 is 1. So 3 to the^ of 1
+ 23 is 26. And 26 is divisible by 13.
So we can check n = 1. 3 ^ 4 to ^ 1 +
23.
4 to the^ of 1 is 4. 3 to the power of 4
+ 23. 3 to the^ of 4 is 81
+ 23 is 106.
104
and 104 is
probably 13 * something 8. Yes, 8. So it
is divisible by 13 for n = 2.
This would be a problem for us.
Uh because 4 to the^ of 2 is 16. 3 to
the power of 16. I have no idea how much
it is and in fact when we go to for
example n=
20 even computers will have problem. So
we need solve it here differently. Uh
one important mark here that like you
see it is 4 to the^ of 216 not 4 * 2 8
because when we have 3 to the^ of 4 but
everything to the power of n then we
multiply powers right exponents
uh but uh when there is no uh this
bracket it means that we need to arise
this number to this power. Okay. So what
we want to use is congruences.
We have this thing start with this.
It is congruent to uh 3 to the power of
4
time
4 to the^ of n minus one. Sorry.
How is that? Because the hill is 4 to
the^ of one. So powers add and we have
still 4 to the^ of n. Uh why I have
chosen this because I remember that 3 to
the^ 4 is 81 and I like have one at the
end. Like you see I don't put
mod
13 here
because uh we know from the exercise
that this is the case. So I put it at
the end at least at the end of the line.
So we have this thing. So I can write it
you know we have times product. So we
can write it with brackets. So it is 3
to the^ 4 to the power of 4 to the^ of n
minus one. uh it's not it is equal in
fact but even if it is equal in
congruences we put triple equality let's
say okay 3 to the^ 4 is 81
so we have 81
to the power of 4 to the^ of n minus one
and we can write
mod 13 here
we will go to the next line
Okay, now we need some formulas. Maybe
you remember from the presentation a to
the power of m is congruent to b to the
power of m if and only if
a is congruent to b. Let's see from this
perspective maybe 81
81 is
13 because we want to use 13 times
something plus something
probably 6 60 708 yes 6 + 3 so we can
say that 81
is congruent
to three this and this
mod of 13
because three is divided by 13. It is
zero free remainder and 81 / 13 is 6
free remainder
and now we can both sides raise to the
power of
4 to the^ of n minus one. So 81
to the power of 4 to the^ of n -1
is congruent to 3 to the^ of 4 to the
power of n minus one. Okay, we have it.
We have something.
Let's see. We have 3 to the^ of 4 to
the^ of n something something. And then
3 to the^ 4 to the^ of n minus one. It
means that when we decrease n the
remainder stays.
So in fact we can do something like
that. 3 to the^ 4 * 4 nus 2 this time
again 3 to the^ 4 4
again the same thing 81 and so on and we
will have that it is 3 to the^ of 4 to
the^ n minus 2 modulo 13
and so on and so on
and we can repeat this process until
n will be zero.
n -1 n - 2 n -3 and -4 all have the same
remainder. So at some point we will have
n minus n
modulo 13. So it is congruent to 3 to
the power of 4 to the^ of 0
modulo 13
which is 3 to the^ of 1
modulo 13. So it is congruent to 3 to
the power a3 is congruent to three
free
model of 13. Okay. Okay. And now we need
to prove that this number is divisible
by 13. But 23 is congruent to 10.
Model 13. I just uh subtracted 13 from
here and this is 10. So 3 to the power
of 4 to the power of n + 23 is congruent
to
3
+ 10
modulo 13
which is congruent to 13 modulo 13
and 13 / 13 is 1. Uh and remainder is
zero.
So it is divisible.
What was to be shown?
Okay. The second task
exercise two.
Determine the remainder when the number
is divided by 12.
It looks ugly but is it is extremely
simple.
1 factorial is 1.
So divided by 12 the remainder also is
one. Two factorial is two. So divided by
12 the remainder is two. 3 factorial is
6. So divided by 12 the remainder is
six. 4 factorial is uh 24 and divided by
12 the remainder is zero. Right? Because
24 is 2 * 12 + 0. and then five
factorial it is 4 factorial * 5 and
because this thing is divisible by 12 so
the whole thing is divisible by 12 the
same with 6 factorial which is 4
factorial * 5 * 6 and so on so in fact 1
factorial + 2 factorial + 3 factorial +
4 factorial plus
100 factorial
is congruent to the remainder is one,
the remainder is two, the remainder is
six
and all others are zeros.
Modulo 12.
So the remainder is nine. The remainder
is nine.
Okay. Exercise three,
we show that 2 ^ of 20 - 1 is divisible
by 31. Again, we are trying to use some
exponents.
Uh for example,
2 ^ of 20. We can do it in one way. 2 to
the^ of 4 to the^ of 5. It is 16 to the^
of 5.
or 2 to the^ of 20 is
2 to the^ of 5 2 the^ of 4 in that way
and this is 32 to the^ of four and we
will use the second one you will see in
a second way.
So
2 to the^ of 5 is 32
which is congruent to 32 / 31 modulo 31
which is congruent to - 9
modulo 20 31. Yeah, as uh you know 6 k +
2 6 k - 4 or 6k + 4 6k -2 we just
subtract six and here the similar thing
uh we subtracted from 32 41 and it is -9
the remainder is the same. So we can
write and is a smaller number right than
32.
So we can write that 2 ^ of 20 is
congruent to 2 ^ 5 to the^ of 4
uh modulo
41
and it is congruent to uh instead of 32
we can write - 9
to the power of 4
modulo 80 not 80 but 31 1
and
- 9 ^ 2 is 81.
So we can write that it is 81 * 81
modulo 41. This is easy to compute
manually. But uh but let's go deeper.
82 is divisible by 41. Again 82 is
divisible by 31. So 81 is almost
divisible by 31. It needs one more. So
in fact it is congruent to -1.
And this 81 is also congruent to minus1
modulo 41.
And this is congruent - 1 * -1 is 1 to 1
modulo 41.
So 2 to the power of 20 when divisible
by 31 it gives remainder 1 and minus one
it gives remainder zero. So 2 ^ of 20 -
1 is congruent to 1 - 1
modulo 41 and that is congent to zero.
So it is divisible.
As you remember we can subtract
congluences.
We can arise them to the same power. We
can multiply them like here. And we can
subtract and go to negative numbers if
it is easier to compute.
And fortunately we have done it in one
page. So I don't I didn't need to scroll
it. Okay. This is all in this chapter.
See you in the next one.
Hello. This section on combinations will
be much shorter. We will now get
familiar with binomial coefficient. The
Newton symbol as it is called in some
places which you might have already seen
in high school. The binomial coefficient
for numbers n greater or equal k greater
or equal z is the number n choose k
divided by the formula n choose k is
equal to n factorial / k factorial * n -
k factorial. So for example calculate 7
choose 3. 7 choose 3 we put 7 in n place
three in k place 7 - 3 is 4. So it is 7
factorial / 3 factorial * 4 factorial.
Now 4 factorial cancelled out with 7
factorial that is 5 * 6 * 7 / 3
factorial. So it is 5 * 6 * 7 / 6. We
cancel out 6 with 6 and it is 5 * 7 so
it is 35. 7 + 3 is 35. For n and k non-
negative integers the number n choose k
is positive integer. So it is equal at
least one. Basic properties n choose k
is equal to n n minus k. So in other
words,
7 7 to 3 is the same as 7. 7 - 3 is 4.
So those two are equal. 10 choose 2 is
equal to 10 and so on. N is equal to n
choose n because n - 0 is n and it is
equal to 1. n choose 1 and n choose n
minus one is equal to n. So for example
10 choose 1 is 10. We also have a
recursive formula like you see. So using
it we can compute for example 5 choose 2
5 choose 2. So it is equal n - 1 k -1.
So it is 4 choose 1 + 4 choose 2
4 + 1 is uh 4 because of this uh
formula. So it is four plus and we can
break down four choose two again uh four
choose two four here two here 4 - 1 is 3
2 - 1 is 1 so it is 3 choose 1 + 3
choose 2 uh without the fraction
3 choose 2 again 3 choose 1 is 3
4 + 3 and 3 choose 2 By this formula, it
is the same as 3 choose 1. So it is 3
and it is 10. So 5 choose 2 is 10. So it
is not a convenient method to to compute
binomial coefficients but it can be
useful in some proofs. The next one n
choose k. It is n * n -1 * up to n - k +
1 / k factorial 1 * 2 * 3 * k. We have
seen it in this case 7 choose three it
is seven factorial 3 factorial 4
factorial and 7 factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 *
4 * 5 * 6 * 7 4 factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 *
4 this cancel out and we can put it in
reverse order so it is 7 * 6 * 5 divided
by 1 * 2 * 3. So here is 1 * 2 * up to
k. And here is 7 6 5 and so on up to n
minus k + 1. 7 - 3 is 4 + 1 is 5. So we
can always compute that in that way that
we compute the difference between 7 and
3. It is four. We add five and we write
567 or 765.
and this multiplication.
Similarly,
10 choose 8.
If this is bigger number, we can just
use this formula. So, it is 10 choose 2.
And again, it is
10 * 9. 10 - 2 is 8 + 1 is 9. So, that's
it. over 1 * 2 and it is 5 * 9 so 45.
Another convenient formula is n choose k
is equal to n / k * n -1 choose k -1. So
for 7 choose 3
it is 7 / 3 * 6 choose 2. We can use the
same uh formula again. So it is 7 / 3 *
6 over 2 * 5 choose 1 and this is five
right
3 * 2 is 6 so it cancel out with 6 it is
7 * 5 so it is 35
and this formula is very efficient we
can go to the last formula the sum of
all n k from k that is equal to 0 to n
always gives 2 to the^ of n. For
example,
4 * 0 + 4 * 1
+ 4 choose 2
+ 4 * 3 +
4 choose without fraction 4.
It is 2 to the power of four. So it is
16. We don't know how much each of these
element is but there will be 16 in
total. So now why is this binomial
coefficient called the binomial
coefficient or binomial expansion? We
have those um formulas that we know from
high school at least for the power of
two and three. Right? Of course they are
up to every number every natural number.
These coefficients 2 3 3 4 6 4 5 10 5 10
5 follow a pattern. So basically on the
beginning we have x to the power of
this.
Then we have x to the power minus one.
So 3 2 1 zero. It is x to the^ 0 which
is one. The same with y which is zero.
And the power of y increases by one.
Yeah, the x decreases one by one and y
increases 1 2 3 4 5. This is one thing.
The second thing is uh we have always
one element more than in the previous
formula. Here we have 1 2 3 four. I mean
without those two that we just can write
simply by x ^ 5 and plus y to the^ 5. So
we have four three here only two here
one here and zero here and those numbers
2 3 and so on they comes from those
numbers 2 choose 1 is two 3 + 1 is 3 3 +
2 is 3 4 + 1 is 4 4 2 is 6 4 3 is four
and so on 5 10 10 5 the same is for
situation when there are minuses not
pluses. We only have uh minus plus -
plus - plus - plus. So once plus ones
minus and we start with a positive
value. So this uh worksh positive and
negative numbers because we have exactly
the same numbers only the the sign is
changing these numbers. These all
numbers which we have here in the
formulas as coefficients can also be
obtained in another way namely using
Pascal's triangle. We build Pascal's
triangle like this. We start with one at
the top then we put ones on the edges
and every inside number is the sum of
the numbers above it. So here it it is
two. Here 1 + 3 is 4 3 + 3 is 6. This is
the situation for zero power that I
haven't written. So x + y to the^ 0 is
just one. So this is for the power zero.
This is for the power one. These are
coefficients.
This is power 2. 3 4 5 6. And we can see
that we have exactly those numbers. 1 5
10 10 5 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 And by the way,
these are of course the correct results
uh for
like this 5 2
is
this is 0 1 2 so it is 10. So if we want
to say how much 7 choose 3 is 7 choose
3, we do not need to compute nothing
special. We can simply have a huge
Pascal triangle printed somewhere. It
would be seventh line.
And here is um coefficient 0 1 2 3. So
15 + 20
it is 35.
So we can count it also in this way. We
have many ways. Okay, that's all for
this lesson. See you in the next one.
Hello. Now we are dealing with
combinations. A combination without
repetition is defined as any subset of a
set with distinct elements. Here the
order of elements in the set is not
important. This not important order is
especially in the set already chosen by
us meaning in the subset. Example the
combinations of the set A B CDE E are a
zero element subset is simply the empty
set. A one element subset is each of
these elements A B C D E. Two element
subsets are A B A C A D A E B C B D B E
C D C E D E. And here one might wonder
whether BA should also appear. No, it
should not because AB and BA are for us
the same set. In combinations the order
does not matter. BB should not appear
nor AA because we are considering
combinations without repetitions. That
is we do not take the same element two
times. Here are three element subset.
Again we cannot find elements like aba
because that would mean some element is
taken twice. But these are combinations
without repetition. And we also do not
have CBA the way we have ABC because for
sets these are exactly the same set ABC
or CBA. You can compare this to having
an apple a pear and a plum in a basket.
And if someone says we have a plum and
apple and a pear so different order it
is the same thing. This is how all the
four element sets look and there is only
one five element set without considering
order. We can see how many sets there
are of size 0 1 2 3 4 and 5. The empty
set is one. There are five one element
subsets. 10 two element subsets 10 three
element subsets. five four element
subsets and one five element subset.
Maybe this reminds you of something
precisely of Pascal's triangle namely 5
choose 0 is 1, 5 + 1 is 5, 5 to 2 is 10
and so on. In other words, the number of
subsets of a given size in combinations
is also known beforehand exactly with
the help of the binomial coefficient.
Yes, the number of k element
combinations of an n element set is
given by the formula n choose k. To
emphasize that we are talking about k
element combinations of an n element
set. We often write c kn or cn k. And
unfortunately this is not consistent. In
some countries it is c kn because we
read that in that way. K element
combinations of an element set but in
most countries it is C and K like here.
So you need to be careful here. Also
there is a known
this way of writing it C N K or again C
KN. So you need to be very careful here.
I will use this international way of
writing it. Now a combination with
repetition is defined as any subset of a
finished set with distinct elements
where elements in subsets may be
repeated. Again the order of elements is
not important. Example the combinations
with repetitions of the four element set
ABCD are there will be quite a lot of
them. Again the empty set one element
combinations are the same as four
combinations without repetition ABC D.
Two element ones are a AB A C A D BB BC
BD C D. Again there is no CA because A C
and CA are the same set just like apples
plums only. Now we can have apple like
two apples right here we have three
element ones and for four element ones
that would be very many of them so I'm
not writing them all out. We have one
zero element set four one element 10 two
element and 23 element. Further we have
35 four element combinations of the set
ABC D and 56 five element combinations
of the set ABCD and so on. How come five
element? Well because elements may be
repeated. We may have a A a or a B c
etc. So in combinations without
repetition it's not always a true that k
must be less than or equal to n. And in
addition the number of sets of a given
size increases with size. It is not the
case for combinations without
repetition. And yes again in the case of
combinations with repetition the
condition k is less or equal n does not
apply. The number of k element
combinations with repetitions of n there
should be a space of an n element set is
given by the formula. Again it can be
written as kn or n k most it is c with
dash on top of it and that's the formula
we saw here that for four element set
there are 23 element subsets. Let's
calculate it now. So see we have four
element set we have three element
subsets it is
4 + 3 7 - 1 is six and
it is three here and we don't we do not
need to use this formula we can just
compute it normally. So it is 6
factorial / 3 factorial. 6 - 3 3
factorial. It is now 4 * 5 * 6 / 1 * 2 *
3. 2 * 3 is 6. So it is really 12. Now
when to use combinations and when to use
k permutations or k tapus it is easy. In
combinations the order of elements does
not matter and in fact this is our the
only distinguishing mark. We may have
the exact same problem but the intention
may be different. So we then use
combinations not k permutations or kapos
that is not the original rule of
multiplication and addition. Example in
how many ways can we choose two people
out of five? Well, now it depends if the
order of people matters in the way we
choose. For example, in a game where you
stand on stairs and it matters who will
step on the first stair. If the order of
people is important, we cannot just swap
them and claim it is the same case. Then
in the first place, we have to choose
among five people. We can choose one of
five that is five here. In the second
place on the second uh second step of
stairs uh we have to choose one of four
people five times for is 20 simply by
the rule of multiplication right but if
the order of people is not important if
we choose a delegation someone goes to
the director two people it does not
matter if we say John and Anna or Anna
and John then it is simply 5 choose 2 5
factorial 2 factorial 3 factorial 4 * 5
/ 2 because 5 factorial divided by 3
factorial cancels and we get 10. Notice
that it is exactly half of the previous
result because for the two people lack
of order means essentially dividing by
two since John Anna and Anna John are
the same case. Is it always dividing by
two? No. Always if we have counted in
this way this one and then realize we
actually won it without considering the
order then it suffices not to divide by
two but by factorial of two. Here
factorial two that is two but if we had
chosen three people then factorial
three. If four people then factorial
four we would need to divide by the
previously obtained result. And let's
write it down. Notice that the formula
for combinations without repetition n
factorial k factorial n minus k
factorial is the formula for k
permutations
n factorial n minus k factorial divided
by the number of permutations of the
subset itself. It means k factorial. In
other words, if we choose three out of
10 people but the order matters then we
have some number of possibilities called
k permutations. But if we then decide
that the order does not matter, instead
of counting combinations from scratch,
we just divide by three factorial that
that is six. The result we had before,
we divide by six. And conversely, if we
solve a problem thinking order did not
matter, we got let's say 55 and then
realize that order actually does matter.
Then we simply multiply the number
obtained for example 55 by the factorial
of the subset length. For example, if we
chose three balls, elements, whatever,
then times six. If four, then times 24
and so on. Okay. Examples of when we use
combinations when order really does not
matter in those cases always does not
matter. We will see in the next lesson.
See you there.
Hello. So we know that combinations with
repetition or without repetition are
used where the order does not matter. So
basically well elo jackpot power ball
and similar lotteryies it does not
matter whether 1 2 3 or 3 2 1 comes out
and it does not matter how we marked it.
It is still the same combination. It
does not matter in what order we marked
those numbers and a card game for
example queen of hearts king of spades
is the same as king of spades and queen
of hearts. We have them in hand. We can
simply shuffle them and have the same
cards. There probably is no serious game
where the order of cards in the hand
would matter. Probably the only such
game is just war or it is called battle
somewhere. Delegations meaning we choose
two people who have to go somewhere or
do something whether it is Anna and John
or John and Anna that is that is exactly
the same. choosing places. Um I couldn't
find better uh translation. For example,
we have three drawers and we want to put
something in any two. So whether we
choose the first drawer and then the
second or the second as first and then
the first, it does not matter. We have
10 lockers in locker room and we want to
open three of them and it does not
matter in which order we open them. Of
course, what we put there does matter
and sometimes the order of things placed
there and in all other places where from
the context it is clear that order does
not matter. For example, forming teams,
choosing side dishes for a meal,
selecting exam problems, etc. So, pizza
with the pineapple, corn, and ham is the
same as pizza with corn, ham, and
pineapple. Likewise, if for an exam we
can select tasks, exercises, for
example, three out of 10, it probably
does not matter in what order we do
them. And above all, choosing a subset
from a set. Similarly, for combinations
with repetition, when from context, it
is clear that elements are
indistinguishable.
For example, distributing identical
candies only the number matters. We have
five people. We distribute 10 candies.
And it does not matter in what order we
hand out the candies. Everyone get to
the same candies. Similarly, selecting
ingredients for pizza when they can be
repeated like double cheese, double h,
right? Getting a certain amount using
given denominations. Right? If you want
to make $100 using given denominations
like $1, $2, and $5, we can do it in
different ways, of course. But wherever
we have $5 and $2, which is $7 or we
have $2 and $5, which is also $7. It
does not matter. It is the same $7,
right? Creating teams in an RPG game. We
have five character classes and must
form a team of four. It can be four
mages or mage knight. Mage knight. Enter
again. Order does not matter. Mage
knight mage knight is the same as night
knight. Mage mage. Ordering ice cream.
Free scoops flavors may repeat. Order
does not matter. Creating codes as long
as the code ABC is considered the same
as BBCA. On the internet you can buy
digital padlocks where the order of
numbers does not matter, only their
presence. Okay. Example, determine how
many ways we can draw two queens from a
deck of 52 cards. Information about 52
cards is only information that this is a
standard deck of cards. That docker
cannot be a queen nor that this is not a
deck for a game like black peter. The
solution is simply drawing any two for
queens. We have six ways. It might seem
there should be more, but if we check
the justification, we can have queen of
spades and queen of clubs. Queen of
spades and queen of diamonds. Queen of
spades and queen of hearts. Queen of
clubs and queen of diamonds, queen of
clubs and queen of hearts, queen of
diamonds and queen of hearts. We have
six ways. If you think some are missing
here like queen of diamonds and queen of
spades, but that is the second option
indeed. So similarly drawing two hearts
that would be 15 choose two since there
are 15 hearts in a deck. Another example
determine the probability of winning the
jackpot in our jackpot. Probability in
our cause is only the number of
favorable events divided by the total
number of events. Solution there is only
one winning possibility. We must guess
all seven numbers. So favorable events
are in total one event. The total number
of possible outcome is 50 choose 5 * 12
choose 2 because we need to guess five
numbers out of 50 and at the same time
we need to guess two numbers out of 12.
We calculated it comes out 139 millions.
The probability equals one over this
number and in percent it is about
0.000000000000007%.
By the way we presented here whether for
probability for this jackpot or whether
for cards with those approaches we will
not do too many problems. We still need
something namely we need the
multiplication and addition rules for
the combinations and it will be in the
next lesson. See you there.
There is not much to say about the
addition and multiplication rules in
combinations because they work exactly
the same as they did for the rest of
combinotaics. Meaning if it is and we
multiply, if it is or we add. Again we
must make sure that the cases do not
overlap. Usually in combinations this
condition is satisfied. But maybe we'll
see one example where this is not true.
And actually let's do some examples. In
how many ways can we draw two queens and
three kings or three queens and two
kings? Solution. So from four queens we
choose two and from four kings we choose
three kings or from four queens we
choose three queens and from four kings
we choose two kings. We see that thoseh
are basically the same products because
order in a product does not matter. So
we can write it as as two times. We
already calculated 4 to 2 in the
previous lesson. it is 6 and 4 + 3 is
the same as 4 + 1 so it is 4 and the
result is 38. In how many ways can we
choose three cards from a standard 52
card deck such that we have at least one
ace. At least one ace means that we are
choosing one ace from four cards and
from the remaining 38 cards not having
aces, right? 52 cards minus four aces
from 38 cards we choose two cards. And
this is the part where many people get
lost. It is not enough to write choosing
one ace from four cards. We choose three
cards. Choosing one ace from four cards
would mean that we choose only one card.
So uh 4 choose 1 * 38 choose 2 or from
four aces we choose two and from
remaining 38 cards we choose one or from
four aces we choose three and from
remaining 38 cards we choose none. We
write it down here you can notice that
uh the calculation of 38 choose 2 goes
very fast. It is done like that 38 minus
2 is 36. Then the next number is 37 and
38. Or another way to remember how to
quickly compute this is by remembering
it should be as many numbers in
numerator as it says here. So two
numbers and now we subtract from 38 38 *
37 and that's it because we need two
cards. So if it is small number simply
smaller than half of this it should be
the same amount of numbers here as the
button says you don't need to write it
as factorial. So the solution is 4,84.
Another solution for this is like
thinking from 52 cards we choose any
free except the situation where from 38
cards that is all about aces we choose
all three. That is a kind of subtraction
rule that from all cases we subtract
those that do not fit and this will also
be 4,84.
Note that when we solve examples like
those we do not compute it up to the end
usually it appears as here in golden
coral. Yes, when you have the answer in
scientific book or a school book the
answer is like this not 4,84.
Usually there is no further calculation.
Okay. Probability solve similarly. So
what is the probability that from a deck
of 52 cards we choose at least one ace?
In the first case it is the part which
is in gold divided by the total number
of events and total number of events is
choosing three cards from 52. We can see
that uh the probability is between 1/4
and 15. We can do the second case as
well. That is again what we see divided
in golden divided by 52 choose 3. So why
it is 1 - 58 choose 3 divided by 52
choose 3 because when we divide by 52
choose 3 which is total number of
events. This is one and minus this
fraction. And of course the the result
is the same. In other words we can use
the complimentary probability.
Complimentary probability means from one
from 100% we subtract the situation we
are not interested in and we are not
interested in the situation where from
38 cards we choose three that is all
except the aces we choose three. Next
problem what is the probability of
winning in lotto? It is also known as 6
out of 39 a lot available in Canada,
Poland, Germany and Spain maybe in other
contest too. So uh what is the
probability of winning in lotto with
three numbers, four numbers, five
numbers, six numbers in the game? Six
balls are chosen by the machine, the
randomization machine. And we need to
guess at least three of them. And if we
guess four, five or six, we get bigger
prizes. So the solution from six chosen
by the machine numbers, we guessed
three. But that is not all because we
picked not three but six numbers and
from the remaining 33 numbers because
the letter is 39 we chose another three
we chose it happened. So the probability
is exactly that divided by total number
of events that is 39 choose 6 because
from 39 balls we pick six and it is
about 1.77%.
For the probability of getting four, it
is similar. From the six numbers we had
to hit four and from the remaining 33 we
hit two. The probability of hitting five
is already really low. We see it and for
the six is really low. And we can wonder
what the probability of winning at least
three number in lotto is. This is of
course the sum of those four
probabilities. We can write it like this
that it is probability of uh hitting
three or four or five or six. And you
can see that it is not so much more than
hitting just three numbers divided by
total events that is um choosing six
balls from 49. So you can see that uh
hitting four, five or six are very
unlike here also the notation is not the
best because uh 3 - 6 is minus 3. Here I
meant the probability of winning from 3
to six but professionally it is written
like this where X is our event
complimentary probability that is from
100% we subtract the situation that is
that 0 1 or two happened that we guessed
0 one or two balls and it is also 1.86
86. As I mentioned, we will not focus
much on probability in this course. So,
these were possibly the last examples
with probability. Now, let's move on. In
a company, there are five programmers
and four managers. We want to select a
three person team, but at least one
member must be a programmer. In how many
ways can we do this? So one way is to
take one programmer and two managers or
two programmers and one manager or three
programmers and no managers. So the
total number of ways is 80. All by
complimentary we are choosing three
people from nine and we only do not
accept situation when we have chosen
three managers because managers are
there are four managers. Now let's uh
see the situation I said on the
beginning that some cases can overlap.
So in other words, let's see how the
inclusion exclusion principle works for
combinations. Of course, this is a kind
of uh inclusion inclus exclusion
principle because we include the
situation that from nine people we
choose three and exclude the situation
that from four specific people we choose
three. But I mean a more complicated
example. We have 10 books and three
shelves. In how many ways can we place
the books on the shelves so that no
shelf remains empty? So without worrying
here about empty shelves we would have
because it is uh combinations with
repetition 12 choose two 66 ways. So if
we wanted to put 10 books into three
shelves, it turns out we have 66 ways.
Let's move a little higher. If one shelf
is empty, then the remaining two must
hold all the books. So we have 11 cases
when the shelf is chosen. However, we
can choose any of the three shelves to
be the empty one. So in general, we have
33 possibilities of distributing the
books into two shelves. Now when two
shelves are empty, then all the books go
into a single shelf. This is one
situation. And the number of ways uh to
choose two empty shelves is three choose
two uh which is three. It can be first
and second shelf, first and third shelf
or the second and third shelf. So using
three shells in any way we have 66 ways.
Using only two shells uh we have 33
shells and when using only one shelf we
have three ways. Uh it is either one of
those three shells. Generally we can put
10 books in three shelves. Every book
can choose a shelf and it is a
combination with repetition because the
the order is not the matter in two
shelves in 33 ways in one shelf in three
ways. So the answer in general is 66
minus the situation when we consider
only two shelves. But when we consider
only two shelves, it may happen that all
the books are in one shelf. So we need
to plus this again the situation when we
consider one shelf. So in general there
are 36 possibilities ways to put those
books on the shelves. I mean when the
order does not matter if uh two books
are on the shelf uh first. It does not
not matter which one goes first which
one is on the left. We only consider
what books are on the shelves. And this
is exactly the formula for the inclusion
exclusion principle. Maybe it is a this
example is complicated. So we can think
about it differently.
Go back here. So one interesting note at
the end that these problems can be
written in really different ways. So if
we have 10 books and three shelves, how
many ways can we place books on shelves
so that no shelf remains empty? It is
like the problem how many three-digit
numbers are there such that the digits
sum to 10 and none of the digits is
zero. This is exactly the same problem
and I think it is much more easier to
understand this and all the solutions
are here. We can read them as 118.
Meaning in the first shelf there is one
book. On the second shelf there is one
book and on the third shelf there are
eight books and so on. Two books on the
first shelf, one book on the second
shelf and seven books on the third
shelf. And here we can nicely see that
our calculations were correct. There are
36 ways. So it is often nice to replace
the context from the problem with
another one that it is easier to
understand. Okay, this was a quite
complicated example. In the next lesson,
we will solve a few more problems,
probably quite simpler ones. See you
there.
Hello. Now, let's solve some exercises.
Exercise one. From a standard deck of 52
cards, we choose five. In how many ways
can the selection be made? So that and
the point A there are exactly three
cards of the same suit. So we have
exercise one
and
there are exactly three cards of the
same suit. So we could write that uh
from the 13 cards because there are four
colors in cards and there are 13 cars of
each of them. So from 13 cards we can
choose three cards times and from the
remaining 39 we choose two and that's it
right? No because that solves the
problem. Another problem that uh it
would be here there are exactly three
cards of the color spades or other color
right of the cards.
Then from first cards we choose three
but we can choose one of four colors. So
we can do it in four ways right? We pick
the color then from this color we need
three cards and then from other two
other cards.
Okay, the point B. There is at least one
face card. What are face card? Jack,
queen,
king, and ace. There is at least one
face card. It is easier to compute that
there is no face card. So in our case we
want to compute that from 52 cards we
are choosing five cards
and subtract situations that we are
having all the cards from not the face
cards right so how many of them there
are there are four jacks four queens for
kings for aces so 16 52 minus 16 is that
is six and that the answer. Okay,
something more complicated. Exercise
two.
Exercise
two. On a plane and straight lines are
drawn so that no two lines are parallel
and no free lines intersect at a single
point. How many intersection points are
obtained? So we can solve it depending
on n when n is one. So we have one line
like this. Uh there are zero
intersections right? When n is two we
have two lines and there is only one
intersection.
When n is three
then we have how many intersections? 1 2
3.
when n is four. Now I need to show it
somehow.
So let's
take a look
like here
and
and here.
So we have one, two, three, four, five,
six. And the last one for for now maybe
I will write it here. So we have space
for that. Let's uh recreate this image.
We have something like this. Something
like this, this and this.
And we we could use the uh vertical
line. So here. Okay. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
10.
Okay, we can uh write it down in a
table.
So we have
two rows. Here is n and here are
intersections
in
okay
this is one way of doing that. Maybe I
will write it. Let's write it first
approach.
It can be done better but
this is more obvious way for me. So n is
one then intersections zero n is two
intersection one n is three there are
three intersections 4 6 5 10 and can we
guess what will be
the next numbers
here we have this one this three is a
sum of one and two the six is the sum of
1 2 and 3 this 10 is the sum of 1 2 3
and four So probably it is this way 21.
However, it is like I said probably uh
we need to prove that and we can see
that for every line that we have the
next line will have one intersection
more. Here was zero. Here is one. Then
the new line have two more
intersections. Right? And the previous n
was two. The next line must intersect
all of them. So three of them that's why
three. The next one need to intersect
all those four. So plus four. So it is
correct. So now we need a formula for
counting for example this 15. Right? It
is a sum from 1 to n minus one 5. So
sn the summary is
1 + 2 + 3 + so on up to n minus one
and this is arithmetic sequence. So the
formula is well known.
uh it is the first item plus the last
one
divided by 2 times uh the number of
items. So it is n minus one.
This makes the formula n * n -1
/ 2. But I would say that this wasn't a
fully combinatoric solution. we can have
a second approach the second way of
doing this
uh exercise.
So the number of intersections
is equal to look that every two lines
have one intersection. Right? This line
with this line have one intersection.
This line with this line have one
intersection. Every two lines can have
only one intersection of zero. But those
lines are not parallel. So we have uh
one intersection for every two lines. So
how many intersections is the same
question as in how many ways we can
choose two lines a pair of lines. So in
general we have n lines and we choose
two and that's the end of this exercise.
We can see that it is n factorial to
factorial n minus 2 factorial. So it is
going from the next one n -1 * n
/ 2 and that's all. It's the same,
right? Maybe I will close this.
Okay, the exercise three is much more
complicated.
How many 10 digit numbers are there such
that the sum of the digits equals five?
So for example it is 1 2 1 0 0 uh how
many 10 digit 5 6 7 8 9 10 right it is
five. This is example of the number that
follows this rule. What we know is that
there cannot be six, seven, eight or
nine. The those digits can can't occure
because the sum of the digits would be
more than five. Okay. Now we can uh
solve each of the cases. So
when on the beginning is five
there is only one way right it is a
number that
starts with five and then there are
following nine zeros
6 7 8 9. So there is exactly one way to
do it. Okay. When we have four then the
other number the other digit must be
one.
And we have two different cases. It can
start with four. Then there is one
somewhere here. And we have nine places.
Nine places for one. So it is nine.
And the same situation when the number
starts with one, we have nine places to
put four. So again nine possibilities.
So let's write here the total number.
In that case we have total 18
possibilities for numbers with only four
and one and all other uh digits be zero.
Okay. The next one could be three and
two. It also gives us five. Uh so it is
the same situation right? three two and
somewhere we somewhere we need to put
two somewhere we need to put three so we
have uh 2 * 9 80
but with three we have other case
we can obtain five with 311
and now three can be on the beginning or
one can be on the beginning So when the
uh when free is on the beginning we need
to choose two places for once.
But uh the order does not matter. It
does does not matter if this one goes
here and th this one goes here or if
this one goes here and this one goes
here. Right? It doesn't matter. It
doesn't matter which the place we will
choose the first. Right?
So it is combinations we have from nine
places we need to choose two. It doesn't
matter with which order and when the one
is on the beginning it does matter right
because uh then we need to put one and
three and if here is three and here is
one it's a different situation than we
have chosen one here and three here. So
first we have nine places for for
example three and eight places left for
uh one
right so 9 / 2 is 8 * 9 by 2 so it is 9
* 4 so it is 36
maybe write it here that way and 9 * 8
is 72 two.
Okay, we haven't finished yet. So, the
next situation could be 2 one one.
Uh, no, 211, sorry. 2 2 1.
Uh, so on the beginning again can be two
or can be one.
If one we have the same situation as as
it was here with three because then we
need to uh search for search for a place
for two two so it is 9 / 2
and we know that it is 36 and here when
we have two on the beginning we know
that uh there are 9 * 8 uh possibilities
so 72 yeah the next case is
211
1
and again it can start with two or it
can start with one. If it starts with
two it's easy because we need to search
three places for three ones. So 9 over 3
not over choose 9 choose 3
it is 7 * 8 * 9 / 1 to 3.
It cancels out. It cancels out. So 7 * 3
is 21 * 4 is 84.
But it can start with one. Then we need
to search a place for the two. There are
nine places and we need to search two
places for ones. But they can be
obtained in any order. So this is the
the answer. Uh let's compute that. So we
have 9
* 8 choose 2. So 9 * 7 * 8
/ 1 * 2 it is 4.
So 9 * 7 is 63
* 4 it is 230 and 12 200 maybe here 252
it is 252
and the last one I guess I hope uh there
are five ones three four five then
one one one need to be on the beginning
and four other ones can be anywhere. So
from nine places we need to choose four
and again we need to compute that 9
choose 4
it is nine things here 8 7 6 divided by
1 2 3 4
2 * 4 is 8
this cancels out 7 * 3 is again 21
* 6 it is 126.
Okay. And um how many 10-digit numbers
are there such that the sum of the digit
digits equals 5? It is the sum of this
column. So let's compute that in my
favorite calculator Python. 18 18 + 36 +
72 + 72
+ 56 + 84 + 252 + 126 it is 715.
So the
the sum is $715
715 numbers like that. Okay. And we need
to solve the last one. Exercise four. A
tournament involves 16 teams. In how
many ways we can can these teams be
arranged into eight pairs?
Uh let's see. Exercise four.
How many ways are there to arrange these
teams into eight pairs? One pair is easy
to pick because from 16 teams we pick
two. From 16 teams we pick two. And it
it does not matter in what order they're
right. A that is playing with uh team B
is the same as B is playing with team A.
Of course they can be on the different
um places in the field but the match is
announced uh the same way. Okay. 16
choose two. But then from the remaining
14 teams, we want to pick another two.
And from the remaining 12 teams, we want
to choose two.
10 choose 2
* 8 choose 2.
8 choose 2 * 6 choose 2
4
and 2 choose two which is one
but is it a correct answer no why not
because let's see the situation first we
we have chosen a and b and then we have
chosen c and d and we have calculated
that uh that b and a is the same as A
and B because here the order does not
matter. But here is a product rule
product
and in fact we have said here
that
this order does matter. Right? In our
case, A playing with B and C playing
with D is different than C playing with
D and A is playing with B. Maybe that it
that's the case. There is no information
about that. If you are on an exam, you
should write that you understand the
problem that way that those are
different arrangements.
Okay? Then then it's correct. But if you
want to uh if you want make that happen
that uh those are considered as the same
arrangements. So this one and this one
are the same and they are they will not
be counted twice. We should divide
everything
here by two. But when we have another
group
right uh we can shuffle them in six ways
three factorial ways and for eight
groups eight pairs we need to divide it
by 8 factorial. So this is the answer.
In fact the last one we can write let's
say let's name it ways. How many ways we
can write it differently using the
product notation with big pi notation
because what we have 8 factorial is 8
factorial. So we can divide by 8
factorial
but here we have everywhere two. So it
is over two choose two and here it is 2
4 6 we can rearrange multiplications. So
in this uh in this order 2 4 6 8 10 12
13 16.
So it is 2 I
where I is from 1 then it is 2 to 8 then
it is 16. So it is
big P by notation from E = 1 to 8
uh to I choose 2 / 8 factorial. I would
write it quite better
in that way.
Okay, those are the answers. I would
like to check at least one of those uh
exercises in Python and I think the
easiest will be the third one or the
fourth one. So we can choose we can
solve it in Python and check if the
answer is 715 and it will be easier than
computing this and checking if the
number is the same. So let's do it in
Python in the next lesson. See you.
Okay, a few things about Python. If you
want, you can do the task in another
programming language. For example, let's
say we would like to compute the first
problem. How to do it using Python? We
import from math all the important
things. But the most important for us is
comp that's from combination. Namely,
Python can easily calculate
combinations. We can calculate 13 choose
three comp 13 it's 286.
If you want, we can calculate the first
problem part A. Of course, the formula
must be derived on one's own, but the
result is easily computable using the
comp function. So 4 * comp 33 ft * comp
392
and that's the result. Similarly, part
B, it's comp
52 choose 5 minus comp
36
choose 5. And the answer is like that.
We can't do the second problem using
Python. Of course we can calculate uh
this in Python
but uh we need to drive to this formula
on our own but the first problem very
much so we can do although that might
take us a while we can check how long it
takes. So from
time input per count as you will
remember to check the computation time
of the script we can create a function
to perform this task. Let's call this
function up to five def up to five.
Okay. Initially we have how many equals
zero.
How many numbers there are right? Okay.
Let's uh write start per counter. And
now for each number in the interval the
interval is from the the smallest number
10 digit number is 1 and 9 0. So for a
in range one 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3. We could
write times uh or even 10 to the^ of 10.
But let's select it that way. And the
biggest one we are considering is 5
billion. So we write five and 10 zeros.
3 4 5 6 7 8 9. Remember that it wouldn't
conclude the five it says. So we add
one. Okay. And we are going to check
every one of those numbers. Let's uh
convert it to string using str. So str
is this. If a six appears in the string
or a seven or or an eight or a nine, we
immediately ignore those numbers. So if
six
in str or seven in str
we could write it in many different
ways. Let's keep it simple
or n in str a then continue. For all the
remaining ones we sum the digits which
means we need a list of digits. List of
digits equals to I will use um list
comprehension known in python.
There are other ways uham for example
norman for the loop in other languages.
In str
list of digits we have
now we want to have a sum of them. So
sum is sum of list of digits.
If sum is equal to five
then it's uh our case. So,
how many plus equal one? And we can we
can print how many we have so far.
Print
how many and the last added number.
Okay. When everything is done, we can
print
uh how many at the end. I know it should
be above what
but we can do it how many. Okay. And we
want to print how long did it take. So
let's compute this. Stop equals both
counter. And now print
it took
stop minus start. We rounded to two
decimal places.
Seconds.
That's how long it took. Now press enter
and we can run our function. The time
will be only measured from when function
starts to to when it finished. So it's
not measuring time now. So we want to
run up to five
and I press enter.
We have 284
329
330 and we can see that we are still on
the first billion. So it will take a
while. So at this point I will pause the
video and we will see how long it took
and whether it will be 715.
Well now we are about to see if we
counted the problem correctly. Uh the
only combination left is 5 billion
and on my machine it took 644
seconds. So over 10 minutes. If we tried
to count in the same way how many
11digit numbers have this summing to
six. We would not get the the result
quickly but we would be able to compute
it by hand. Of course, the method
presented here using our up to five
function which simply checks all
possible numbers also passing through 6
7 8 9 digits and only then ignoring them
is not the best algorithm. The better
one would be using recursive functions.
The backtracking algorithm but we just
wanted to check that our result is
correct. So it is okay. That's all for
this lesson.
Hello. Now we have four problems
exclusively connected to binomials. So
let's solve them all. Exercise five
because we last ended at exercise four.
Determine for which natural number n the
inequalities are satisfied
simultaneously.
So we have n choose 8 is more than n
choose 7.
We know what does that mean? So n - 8 is
n - 8 and we start with n - 7
* n - 6 and so on up to n
and divided by 8 factorial.
So up to 8 is small and the same
situation here but we start with n minus
6
n - 5 and so on up to n -1 and n and
seven factorial here.
You can see that some terms are repeated
this whole thing. So we can divide by it
and we can consider if we really can
n -1 * n
because if n is 6 this whole thing is
zero and we cannot divide by six the
same if n is 5 1 0 and so on but n is at
least eight in our case so so we can
divide it we consider only binomials
where n is more or equal k so yes we can
it is n - 7 divided by 8 factorial
is more than here we divided by
everything. So we have only one and also
7 factorial and now we can multiply
everything by this factorial. So 1 * 2 *
up to 8
and it is uh here cancels out
everything. So we have n minus 7 and
here we have 1 2 up to 7 cancels out. So
we have 8 * 1 which is 8. So n must be
more than 15.
So at least 16. The same we do with uh
the second condition. We have n8
is more than n.
So this we know n minus 7 up to n
and is more than n - 8
up to uh n and uh here 1 * 2 * up to up
to 9. Again we divide by
the repeated terms. So we have 1 / 1 *
up to 8 is more than n - 8 by 9
factorial.
We multiply by 9 factorial. So
everything here cancels out except nine.
So it is nine more here. x everything
cancels out. So more than n minus 8
on this side and we have that uh 17 is
more than n is less than 17 other words.
So n is more than 15 is less than 17. So
n must be 16. It's not a number in in
our course in mathematic in discrete
mathematics we only consider integers uh
numbers. So, so we have n=
16.
Exercise 6 maybe here.
Exercise six. Find the number n given
that n choose 3 - n choose 2 is equal
13. So it is a problem to use the same
idea.
n choose 2 = 13. So we have n - 3 n - 2
n -1 n / 6
minus
oh what I what have I wrote uh without n
minus 3 of course
minus um n -1 * n / 2 is equal 13
Uh so we can multiply by 6 and we have
we can multiply everything. So n * n is
n² with n is n cub n cube n * -1 is - n
- n - n² - 2 * n is - 2 n - 2 n²
and -2 * -1 is 2 product with n is just
2 n. And here n * n is n².
So minus uh 3 because
it goes like this. So it's not free. Now
it is. So we have - 3 n 2
and we have - n. So + n + 3 n and 13 * 6
because here nothing cancels out. So we
have 60 and 24 84.
So it is n cub
- 6 n²
+ 5 n
- 84
it it equals zero. We look for solutions
only among the divisor of the free term.
That's how polomials work. But n must be
at least three.
Anything can be three because - 84 will
be negative. Four the same because 4 to
the^ 3 is less than 84.
Uh so five it can't be because it is not
a divisor. So it can be six. It can be
seven
and it can be really nothing else
because 8 to the^ 3 is really big
number. So it will be too much. So n is
6 or 7 we need to check. So when n is 6
it is 6 ^ 3 is
216
- 6 ^ 3 in fact is 216. 30 - 84 it's
not. So probabilities n equals to 7 to
the^ of 3 is 3533. We have this on once
once on the presentation
- 90 uh 49
* 6 50 * 6 is it is 300.
So - 6 uh 1 16 less it is 294
+ 30 - 84 not 30 + uh 5 uh 5 * 7 is 35 -
84 and if we compute this it is zero. So
the solution is n = 7 and you can check
that there is no more solution. So n
equals to 7.
Exercise 7.
Exercise 7 prove that this this is
correct. And here we need a formula
mainly this formula. So recursive
definition for the binomial coefficient
n choose k = n -1 k -1 + n -1 k.
Let's write it. So,
n choose k equ= to n -1 k -1
+ n -1 k. So uh now we can write that uh
we can start with this one 8 choose 4
equals based on this uh this formula it
is 7 choose 3
+ 7 choose 4
here is okay because we we want 7 choose
3 but for 7 choose 4 we can adapt this
formula again. So it is 7 choose 3 plus
and now n is 7 k is 4. So 6 choose 3 6
choose 3 + 6 choose 4 and again we can
use this formula. So we
write those two terms
and say 6 uh choose 4 we have 5 choose 3
+ 5 choose 4.
We we can see that we have those terms.
Right? Now again
it is uh not plus but equals
7 choose 3 + 6 choose 3 + 5 choose 3
+ uh 4 choose 3
and 4 to 4.
And now 4 to 4 is just one. It is the
same as 3 to three. It is also one.
So
it is what we had to prove.
Problem eight we'll do in the next
lesson because it's uh quite longer. See
you.
Hello. Since we have some time for this
lesson, I've added one more problem. The
ninth is simpler from those two but both
are quite complicated. Both are at
university level. Exercise eight. Prove
that for any natural number n more equal
one the number 2 n choose n is divisible
by n + 1 and by 4 nus 2. So for example
if n is five it is 10 choose 5. Then we
need to prove that it is divisible by
six and by 18. So of course we need to
do it for for n. And for that we would
like to use this formula. This one n
choose k = n / k * n -1 choose k minus
one. Let's write it down. So
exercise 8
n choose k = n / k * n -1 choose k -1.
So for us we we can put 2 n here and n
here. 2 n choose n
= 2 n / n is 2 *
2 n -1.
Okay. N - one.
Okay. You could think if uh it shouldn't
be minus2 because uh that's what we do
when we assign something for n. For
example, when we assign k minus one and
place, then it should be k minus one to
k minus 2 because it would be 2 k minus
one. But we are not substituting. We
just um lower the number once here and
once here. Okay, this thing it doesn't
answer our
exercise. It answers exercise nine. But
but we go back to this exercise because
it is uh 2 times some integer. So for
sure it is divisible by two. But here we
have n minus one and we wanted to have n
+ one. So instead of doing it that way,
we will write 2 n + 1 n + 1
= 2 n + 1
/ n + 1 *
2 n / n. And now
this
integer.
So this also must be an integer because
it equals.
So n + one
divides 2 n + 1 or n + 1 divides
2 n choose n what we need. So one of
them is true at least one of them. So if
we prove that this is not the case then
n + n + 1 divides 2 n choose n and let's
prove that n +1 does not divide to n +
one for n. We can compute gcd
of 2 n + one and n + one.
From ltd algorithm, we know that we can
subtract uh from this number this
number, right? So, gcd
2 n + 1 minus in brackets n + 1 is just
n + one. And again, we can subtract
n + 1 - n is
n
and 1. So the greatest common divisor is
one. So they are co-prime.
And that's that means that n + one does
not divide to n + one. So let's write
it. n +1 does not divide to n + one. So
it might be this case. And it is exactly
what we wanted to prove.
Now this thing so we can use this
formula
we have 2 n choose n = 2 * 2 n -1 nus
one. What we want to prove uh is that
this thing this thing so this thing is
divisible by 4 n minus 2 but this equ= 2
* 2 n -1.
It is obvious that this number is
divisible by two. So we only need to
prove that this number the second one is
divisible by 2 n minus one. So we need
to prove that 2 n -1 choose n - one is
divisisible by 2 n -1 and we can prove
the bigger theorem. So theorem is
that when n and k are co-primes,
you remember I don't need to put gcd
here. Then
n divides n choose k. This is our
theorem and we want to prove it. If we
prove it, it means that this thing is
divisible by 2 n by 2 n minus one. So
divisible by 4 nus 2. So we have n
choose k equ= n / k * n -1 k -1. Right?
We know that k does not divide n.
So it must divide this number. k divides
n minus one. k minus one n minus one k
minus one is an integer and when divided
by k because k divides n minus one
choose k minus one it's still an integer
so it is n * some number some large
number
and this large number is in integers we
wanted to prove that n divides this
But it only means that we need to prove
that n divides n * l where l is an
integer but it is obvious n divides n *
l and it is l. We know the the result.
So really if n and k are the compliments
then n divides n choose k.
So we only need to check that 2 n minus
one and n minus one are complies because
then 2 n -1 divides this and it is
really the case the same case. So let's
check it
2 n minus one n minus one we uh
subtract. So it is
I subtract n minus one so + one. So it
is n minus one again uh we subtract this
is bigger so n minus n minus one and it
is gcd
1 and n minus one so it is one they are
compliance so it is fulfilled that 2 n
minus one divides this and two divides
this so 2 n choose n is divisible by 4 n
- 2 and that's exercise 8. Now exercise
nine. We know one way to prove it. We
just use this formula and that's enough.
2 n
= 2 * 2 n -1 n -1.
This is an integer because it is always
an integer. So
uh so this thing is divisible by two.
But I wrote it uh this exercise 9
because there is one more way to prove
it and it is by using Pascal's triangle.
So for now let's see uh if n is one
and then we have n is one we have 2
choose 1 which is 2 and it is divisible
by two. n= 2. It is 4 choose 2 and it is
we have already computed it. So it is 6
n = 3. It is 6 over 3. 6 choose 3. So it
is uh 4 * 5 * 6 by 6. So it is 20 and so
on.
So let's write Pascal's triangle.
up to some point. Of course.
21 35 35 21 71 and maybe one more. Uh 28
it is 56. It is 70 56
28
81. What you can can see is that this uh
Pascal triangle is reflected. This those
numbers are on this side. There is a
symmetry here. Right?
Numbers on the left are equal to the
numbers on the right. And those numbers
what we want to check are those. this
one, this one, this one, this one and so
on. And
for every row it is 2 to the power of uh
the number of row where this is zero.
Right? This is this uh this formula that
4 choose 0 4 choose 1 4 choose 2 4
choose 3 4 choose 4 in total is 2 to the
power of four. So the sum of the rows
are 2 to the power of the number of
rows. So in zero row we have 2 to the^
of zero it is one. Uh first row we have
two to the power of one it is it is two.
Second row first row in fact in our case
but okay maybe do some
arrows.
So we have now the third 2 to the^ 3 is
8.
Four 2 to the^ of 4 is 16.
5 to the^ of 5 is 32.
20 32 right.
64
7 to the^ of 7 is 128. And the last one
8 to the^ of 8 is 256.
Okay. So what we know this is a
symmetry.
We are only interested in those rows.
Second row, f fourth row, sixth row,
eighth row and so on. Right?
Only in those.
And in this case what we have? If we
have some one number in the middle
maybe go here. So we have
number that we want to prove that it is
even because what we want to prove is
that this number which is on the center
is even number. We have number. We have
some numbers on the left. Right.
Some on left.
We have some numbers on the right side,
sum on right.
And it is equal to to the power of K.
Let's write that it is even number
because to every power is even I mean
started from one even number
and we know that this and this thing are
equal
right so
this plus this it is 2 * something so it
is even number so we have number
plus some even number equals some other
even number, right?
1 + 4 is 5 but + 4 + 1 which is also
five is 10 and it is even. So this
number that we are interested in
is
some even number even first minus this
even number even two.
Even minus even. When we subtract even
from even number, it is even number
and it implies that 2 divides our number
and this number was what we wanted 2 n
choose n and that is what has to be
proven. So that's it. Like you see
knowing the pascal triangle is
beneficial for us. Okay, see you in the
next lesson.
Hello. At the end of this chapter, let's
present an important formula related to
bomal coefficient or Newton's binomial.
For certain m, n and r. We have this
formula. Here is a note actually two
notes. The first note is that this
formula holds for the non-natural mn and
r and not just for integers also for m
being for example the square root of 2 n
being pi or e r being seven because we
are still summing our sigma but also
minus 7 in fact the formula still holds.
This is beyond the scope of our course
entirely outside the scope of discrete
mathematics. So this is just for your
information. Second note that to prove
this formula you need to use either
mathematical induction. This is
certainly a part of discrete mathematics
but we will not cover it in this course.
At the end I will present this proof as
it is possible you had mathematical
induction in high school and not
everywhere but some teachers introduce
it. So you can analyze this proof if you
wish all by of so-called falling
factorial which we saw for a moment but
we didn't explore it enough and we won't
explore it in this course. So please
just believe in this formula for now.
And now we have example of use 8 choose
4. It is not two numbers but we can
split it to for example 5 + 3 choose 4.
And now just use this formula here. You
might be surprised because the last term
will be 3 choose 4 for k equal to zero.
Right? It's perfectly fine to assume
that when k is greater than n uh the
result is simply zero. So for the sum we
just look in k= 0 1 2 3 4. We have five
terms. The first of them is zero because
we have three choose four. And then it's
quite straightforward. 5 choose 1 * 3
choose 3. We can compute all of them and
uh it is 70 which is exactly the same as
8 choose 4. Of course, we don't use the
vand formula identity to calculate 8
choose 4 or anything like that because
it's easier and faster to do it directly
anyway. Uh because 8 choose 4 is easy to
compute. Let's compute it. 8 choose 4.
It is 8 factorial 4 factorial 4
factorial. It is from 5. 5 * 6 * 7 * 8 1
* 2 * 3 * 4.
This eliminates this is 2. We have 5 * 7
or 5 * 2 is 10 * 7 is 70. So it is
easier to use direct computation than
this formula. So we don't use and
shouldn't use this formula for such
cases but I wanted to show that it works
if needed all to help you understand the
notation here. Venderman's identity is a
powerful proof tool. Many florence
related to operations on Newton's
binomial binomial coefficient nk can be
proved using this formula. If ever there
is a tricky problem involving binomial
coefficient where something has to be
proven, there is a good chance this
Vandermon's uh formula identity will
make it possible, will make it easier.
So let's do an example. Prove that n= 0
squar n + 1 squar and so on in total is
2 n. You can see 2 n to n quite often.
It is appearing uh for the third time in
our course, right? The solution isn't
hard. Just use the formula. We apply
Fmon's identity where for m= n= l. Why
those numbers? Because when here
[clears throat] is n and n, it is 2 n
choose n. So let's use it in that way.
Applying radon's identity for m= n= l,
we obtain on the left side what I have
said. on the right side we put m and r
and uh n equals to n. So we have this
thing and now from this formula that is
known from our first presentation in
this chapter we know that it is n tok
squared. So it is exactly n z 2 + n n n
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n
n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n n ch 1
2 and so on. And that's basically the
end of the proof. When can you use this
again? Of course, if for example it
would be 3 n choose n, then let r be n
and m be 2 n then 3 n choose 2 n.
Naturally, the left side will be
completely different. But again, vmon's
identity can be used. Also, if there's
something to prove for n + k,
then m is just k and r is just k. And
again we can prove it with this
identity. In reality the applications
are endless. And now proof for those who
know mathematical induction. The theorem
holds for m= n= r = 1. We will prove the
formula by induction with respect to m
and ry n varies.
So we just uh check n + one case.
Here we have used just a definition the
recursive definition for binomial
coefficient for both we are using
wonders identity
then because uh here we have different
numbers r and r minus one. So we
computed this sum for k= r. It is this
because it is m choose r * n r - r which
is zero. So it is one. And now we have
left uh the same sum up to r -1 this
sum. So we can gather them together. uh
then we factor out common uh factor
which is m choose k.
We can see that this is again the
definition
uh like we use it here. So, so we
compact the formula, simplified it and
we have add here n + one uh to zero
which is one to to show that it is
really the same as here but for n + one
because now we can move it again here
because it is the next the next term
right so it is not for k = 0 2 L r - 1
but 2 r and we have m choose k n + 1 r -
k. What was to prove? So it really works
for m n and r uh natural numbers to
prove it for every number. You can
search it on the internet but it's not a
part of discrete mathematics and it is
really hard thing. Okay, see you in the
next chapter.
Hello. With the knowledge gained from
the last three chapters, we can now move
on to a chapter on selected topics in
discrete mathematics. And the first such
topic will be the slice pigeon hole or
box principle. Pigeon hole box principle
states if you place objects into boxes
and we have more objects than boxes,
then at least one box will contain at
least two objects. This is quite a
simple even obvious fact, right? Suppose
we have four drawers. It can be
anything. A box, drawer, room or
anything like that. Yeah. So suppose we
have four drawers. We have five objects
here. Five balls. If you want, we can
put all the balls into one box. And then
certainly one box will have more than
two balls. But if you want to avoid this
by putting one ball into each box, the
last ball must go somewhere where a ball
already is. So one box will contain two
objects. As I said, this simple
observation has many applications.
First, a fairly simple example show that
among 11 chosen natural numbers, you can
always find at least two whose
difference is divisible by 10, any
numbers, right? A million and seven, 33,
etc. We have 11 randomly chosen natural
numbers. We know that the last digit of
any natural number is one of 0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9. So every natural number has one
of 10 units digits. We have 10 boxes
here last digit and 11 numbers.
Therefore among 11 numbers there will be
at least two with the same unit digit
like 23 and 173. And so the difference
of two numbers with the same last units
digit is a number ending with digit
zero. This difference is divisible by 10
which was to be proved. Similarly we can
prove that among 11 numbers that exist
at least two with the same last digit.
Alternatively giving the same remainder
when divided by 10. Among five numbers
that exist at least two giving the same
remainder when divided by four. Because
when dividing by four we have remainders
0 1 2 3. So we have four remainders. So
with five numbers two fall into the same
box. And generally among n numbers there
exist at least two giving the same
reminder when divided by n minus one.
But also problems with a certain context
like in a group of 13 people there are
at least two who were born in the same
month. We have 12 months. So for 13
people two must have been born in the
same month at least two because all
could have been born in the same month.
Similarly for 32 people at least two
were born on the same day of the month.
For eight people at least two were born
on the same day of the week. As I said
it's a simple observation but with it
you can solve very complex problems. One
of them is prove that among the
consecutive powers of seven, 7, 7
square, 7 cube, 7 to the^ 4 and so on,
there exists one, probably more than
one, but at least one that ends with the
digits 001 in the sim representation.
That is the last three digits are 001.
Again, we can analyze reminders of
powers when divided by a,000 because
those are exactly the last three digits.
7 is 0 07. 7 squared is 049.
7 cubed is 3 43. So there are a,000
boxes which are the remainders when
divided by a,000 being 0000 01 and up to
999. And we have 1,01
powers of the number 7. Thus there exist
at least two numbers 7 to the^ of k and
7 to the power of l. And as a matter of
fact, we can assume that K is more than
L. So 7 to the^ of K is more than 7 to
the^ of L with the same remainder. So
two numbers will have the same remainder
say 555 and another 555 or something
like that. The difference is 7 ^ - 7
the^ of L with L smaller. So we write 7
^ of l and in bracket 7 ^ of k - l - 1
which is divisible by 1,000 because they
have the same remainder for some k and l
for example 123 and 123 subtracted one
from the other gives 0 0 at the end so
divisible by a th00and notice that 7 to
the power of r or k or any other number
are numbers built exclusive posively by
multiplying sevens while 1,000 is made
by multiplying three twos and three
fives. So these two numbers 7 to the
power of L and 1,000 are co-prime. So 7
to the^ of L times the this bracket has
last three digits zero and is divisible
by a,000. Right? But 7 to the^ of L
can't be divisible by a th00and being
just sevens. The greatest common divisor
of sevens and twos and fives is 1.
Therefore a,000 must divide the bracket
part. This part. So 1,00 / 7 to the
power k - lus one. That means 7 to the^
k minus l minus one has last three
zeros. Now before subtracting one it had
two zeros and one at the end. So 7 to
the^ k minus l must be 0 0 1 because
after subtracting one it is 0 0 0 right.
So 7 to the^ k minus l is really 7 to
some natural power because k is bigger
than l. So this statement is indeed
correct. There is some we don't know
which one but there is some natural
number that seven to this natural number
gives 0 01 at the end but the problem
wasn't easy the pigeon hole principle or
the dish pigeon hole principle is simple
but can solve very complex problems and
yes typically problems for this
principle involve division last digits
and such but it is not a permanent rule
there are quite geometric problems as
well so It's always worth remembering.
There exists a generalized dish lace
pigeon hole principle that says if we
have n boxes and more than n * k objects
then in at least one box there will be
at least k + one objects. For example,
if we have three boxes and seven objects
then in at least one box there are three
objects. Again an example we have 1,01
natural numbers. Prove that among them
there exist at least 501 even numbers or
at least 501 odd numbers. We have two
boxes sets even numbers and odd numbers.
The total count of numbers exceeds 500 *
the number of boxes. Therefore in one of
the sets there must be at least 501
numbers. And that's it. Similarly, we
can prove that among 17 chess pieces
placed on a chessboard, there are at
least three in the same row and at least
three in the same column. Because even
if you split them evenly with eight
rows, 16 pieces gives two per row and
the 17th has to go somewhere where there
are already two pieces. Similarly, among
30 people, we can find at least five
born on the same day of the week because
7* 4 is 28. With 28 people, each could
be born on a different day of the week,
meaning four per day. And among 29,
there is a fifth person on some day at
least. It is even more probably with 30
people. Of course, again, there are very
complicated problems as well. For
example, from the 43rd first stage
mathematical olympiot prove that among n
plus2 integers, there exist two whose
sum or difference is divisible by 2 n.
And that's not such a simple problem. If
you want to solve it, it's worth noting
that among these n plus two integers, if
there are two with the same remainder
when divided by two n, then the
difference is divisible by 2 n. So we
can analyze only numbers with different
remainders and see that then the sum of
some pair must be divisible by 2 n. As I
said this is a tougher problem. Okay,
that's all for this lesson. See you in
the next one.
Hello. Now we move to the very
interesting stars and bars principle
also called dots and dividers, sticks
and stones. Generally there are many
names and we can come up with new ones
ourselves. So yes it's variously named
as we see combinatorial principle that
allows us to solve many counting
problems such as determining in how many
ways we can place n indistinguishable
balls into k distinguishable boxes or
drawers or anything like that. What are
indistinguishable balls? For example,
table tennis balls. The principle is
very pleasant. I would even say quite
simple, easy, it's fun to use but hard
to grasp at first. And the best
explanation I have ever found so far is
from Wikipedia under the entry stars and
bars. Most of what I will present here
is an explanation and illustration of
the text found there. We introduced this
principle through Wikipedia. Like I said
with two examples, the same examples as
that theorem. First for any two natural
numbers n and k both more or equal one
the number of key tles or there
sequences of natural numbers whose sum
is n= n minus one choose k minus one to
translate this let's do an example
example for n= 10 and k = 4. This
theorem gives the number of solutions to
the equation x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 equ= 10
where x1 x2 x3 x4 are at least one and
all natural integer numbers. It
precisely gives the amount as n -1
choose k -1. So in our case we have four
variables and the sum is 10. So it is 10
- 1 choose 4 - 1 which is 9 choose 3
which is 84. We don't know what those
numbers are. Examples could be 4 3 2 1
the sum is 10 or 11 1 etc. The sum is 10
but there are exactly 84 not pairs but
four element tpples right let's check
this right away in Python. Let's write
how many equals zero. How many equals
zero for a in range from 1 to 10 without
10 of course in fact without nine even
but uh doesn't matter.
Again it is not the best form of code
but we only want to know if we counted
it properly. If a + b + c + d equ= 10
then how many plus equal 1.
And that's it. Let's check how much is
how many. And indeed it is 84 solutions.
The second theorem is very similar. For
any two natural numbers n and k the
number of k taples ordered sequences of
natural numbers but now with zero whose
sum is n equals k + n -1 choose n or
from a familiar formula by computing the
difference it is k + n -1 choose k -1
because we subtract n. Analous example
for n= 10 and k= 4. This theorem gives
the number of solutions to the equation
x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 10. So this the very
same uh equation but now x1 x2 x3 x4 are
more or equal zero. So they are non
negative they can be zero. And this the
number of solutions not what solutions
are but the number of them it is k + n
minus one. So it is 13 choose 10 and it
is 286
and again we check that we indeed get
286 solutions that the formula is
correct at least on on this example. So
how many again can must be zero in the
beginning
we use the same code however now a b c d
can be zero and can be 10 because 0 0 10
is also the solution right so we need to
put it 11
and this means from 0 to 10 that's how
it works in python and if abcd uh equals
in total 10 how many plus equal 1 and
check the the result and it is 286
solutions. Keep in mind for 50 numbers
doing this in Python could be beyond a
computer's ability even with the best
approach with the best algorithm. But we
have a simple formula for it. So where
is the stars and bars principle here?
Well, you can prove these two theorems
using the stars and bars principle which
is exactly what we will introduce now.
Uh let's start with theorem one and as a
matter of fact I used um dots so it is
more dots and dividers here but you can
replace dot with a star it doesn't
matter. So again back to the first for
numbers the sum must be 10 numbers are
greater than or equal to one. Assume
there are n objects represented here by
dot which we place into k containers. So
we have balls in boxes, drawers or
something like that. The containers are
distinguishable for example by color but
the dots are not. So important is
whether we have container one one one
ball three containers with one ball each
and in the last container is seven balls
or in the first container is seven and
the other three have one each but it
doesn't matter how balls are arranged
inside and how they are always getting
mixed around right configurations are
therefore distinguishable only by the
number of dots balls in each container
each such configuration can be
represented by dots and bars where a bar
indicates moving to the next container.
For example, for our n= 10 and k= four,
one possible arrangement is we have 10
balls, four boxes or containers or
drawers. And we have uh written it like
here. And notice that we have four
containers represented by three lines.
In the first container, there are four
balls.
So x1 = 4 4. In the second container we
have x2 = 3, x3 = 1 and x4=
2 and the sum is 10. So we see that
containers and both can be presented
with dots and bars. And right away it's
closely related to our x1, x2, x3, x4
equation. And indeed that plus do that
plus that plus that is 10. I just moved
things up so it would fit. Note that no
container can be empty because x1, x2,
x3, x4 must be greater than or equal to
one in the first theorem. Yeah, no
containers can be empty. So there can be
at most one bar between a pair of dots.
Dots and bars uniquely define the
numbers x1, x2, x3, x4 such that x1 plus
and so on equals 10. We saw that. And
now how many possibilities are there for
such containers with dots or such stars
and bars? There are n minus one spaces
between the dots. Possible places for
bars here, here, here, here, here, here,
here, here, and here. Nine places, nine
gaps between the dots. And the
configuration is determined by the
placement of k minus one bars. We saw
it. We want four boxes containers. So we
put three bars. The order of placing the
bars does not matter. It doesn't matter
if we put this bar first, then this,
then this, or we started with this bar,
then this, and this. It's the same
configuration, the same solution. That's
why we have combinations of choosing k
minus one bars out of n minus one
positions. Right? So therefore, indeed,
the number of solutions is n minus one
to k minus one. As the theorem said
that's exactly what dots and PS are
about. Other problems we transform into
considering how to put balls between
dots. Similarly, the second faster. Now
for any two natural numbers and K this
time they can also be zero. The sum n
can be composed in so many ways. K + N
minus one choose N or the second one.
Here the restriction is loose net to
non- negative natural numbers. Non-
negative means that they can't be
negative but can be zero. In this case,
waking the condition to non- negative
inteious means that the containers will
be empty. Therefore, several bars can be
placed next to each other. For example,
for n= 10 k= 4, the tpple 4 033 can be
represented as this. We have four balls
in the first container, zero balls in
the second container, three balls in the
third container and three balls in the
last container. Which also means x1 is
equal to 4, x2 x=0, x3 is equal to 3 and
x4 is equal to 3 and that again in total
is 10. Now we want to count the ways we
can put such bars. Note that each
configuration contains n + k minus one
symbols, dots and bars. We need 10 dots
and three bars. So n is not changed. N
of them are dots and k minus one are
bars. Those we only need to choose k
minus one out of n + k -1 positions for
the bars. Equivalently choose n
positions for the dots. So really we
have 13 places and need to put three
bars in them. Right? Places are like
this. The first place, the second, the
third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh,
eighth, ninth, 10th, 11th, 12th and
13th. So it really is from 13 places. So
places is n + k minus one or like
written here k + n minus one. Choose n.
It means choose 10 places for dots or
equivalently
choose
uh three places for bars and put uh put
dots elsewhere by using the dots and
bars principle we should be able to
solve problems of the type and only four
types of problems we can solve with
them. Now, how many solutions does the
equation a + b + c equals 100 have for
abc in natural positive or integer
positive? It's the same. How many
solutions does the equation a + b + c
equals 100 when abc are non- negative?
In how many ways can we play seven
indistinguishable ping pong tables
into three labelled containers ABC? In
how many ways we can place seven
indistinguishable ping pong or table
tennis balls into three labelled
container ABC again so that no container
is empty. So here how many? 99 choose
two. Here how many? 100 + 3 - 1 is 102
choose 2 and so on. Notice the dots and
bars principle lets us count situations
where the objects are indistinguishable
but the places are distinguishable. Up
to now we had either both
distinguishable or at least the objects
were. So the dots and bars principle
can't count how many ways can seven
people be placed into five rooms because
people are distinguishable rooms too
after all. How many ways? It is easy to
compute. The first person can pick one
of five rooms. So five. The second one
can choose one of five rooms.
So it is five to the power of seven by
the standard multiplication principle.
Another problem. In how many ways can
seven people be placed into five rooms
so that no room is empty? And you may
wonder how to do this problem. The
correct answer is 16,800.
You may consider how to do it in Python
or mathematically. Hint for mathematical
uh solution since five rooms must be
occupied among those seven people. You
must pick five who will definitely go to
all the different rooms, right? And then
two people can go anywhere. Okay, that's
all for this lesson. See you in the next
one.
Hello. For several important future
topics, we'll make some theoretical
preparations. This is a very difficult
problem from high school from a book
with an advanced profile and you can
wonder how to solve it. When I first
encountered this problem, I simply
couldn't solve it and all my ideas when
carefully analyzed turn out to be wrong.
So the problem is as follows. Calculate
in how many ways seven numbered balls
can be placed into five cells numbered 1
2 3 four and five so that exactly three
cells drawers or boxes are occupied and
I will present some of my favorite
ideas. One was this from five boxes five
cells I pick three to which I will put
balls. So five choose three. And then in
the first box I put one of seven balls.
In the second one of six balls and in
the third one of five balls. Then for
the remaining four balls each can go to
one of the three boxes. So three to the
power of four.
That was a quick guess, but it's
completely long because if you want the
balls down this way.
So, let's say we have chosen three
places where
uh balls should go. First ball can use
one of three cells, not seven.
We do have seven balls, but they can go
to one of three places, not to seven
places. So here I longly assume that the
first of seven boss can go to one of
seven places but that's definitely not
true. The second idea was to improve
this fact. So again from five I choose
three and at the first ball goes to one
of three containers.
Uh those are balls. No uh not
containers. So so this one uh first ball
can go to one of three places. The
second one one to two of places. The
first one goes to the last place. At
that point, these three containers are
filled with at least one ball each. And
now we can put each next ball to any
container box or whatever. So three,
three, three, and three. And it might
seem that this idea is quite good. If
you number the balls, it turns out it's
not that good. So we have those balls
five, six, seven. So namely yes uh the
first ball goes to one of the three
containers, the second to one of two,
the third to one to the last one and
later the balls go anywhere freely. But
notice the ball number seven
can't go to a container alone because
every container is already occupied
which means there is no situation where
container contains seven alone and the
other two containers are remaining
balls. So the correct answer must be
larger than this number.
So it is this thing is smaller than
correct
answer.
And we can keep reflecting on other
ideas which are wrong. Another idea I
had was to arrange seven balls and in
all possible ways. So we have 3 to the^
of seven and with the stars and bars
principle
uh we have seven balls
we put three two bars to divide them
into three sections. We can do it by
picking three places from six, right?
But then
but if we think more carefully, it is
also wrong because stars and bars works
for not distinguishable objects, right?
And in fact in here by 3 to the^ 7 we
mean that 4 three here is a different
solution than 3 4 but in fact it is the
same. So no it's not a good solution. So
look at the correct solution available
in the book from which I took the
problem. Unfortunately I don't know what
book it is. Okay I pasted the solution.
We calculate how many possibilities
there are to choose three cells out of
five that will be occupied.
5 choose three it equals 10. That part
we understand. We calculate the number
of possibilities for placing seven balls
in three cells. We have 3 to the^ of 7
like here.
But from this number we must subtract
the numbers corresponding to situations
in which seven balls are placed in
exactly two of the three selected cells.
Namely, it is 3 * 2 ^ of 7, which is
384. And at the number corresponding to
the situation, all seven balls are
placed in exactly one of the three
selected cells, three possibilities.
Hence, the number of all possibilities
of placing seven numbers balls in
exactly three cells is equal to. We
calculate the number of possible
arrangements of the balls according to
the conditions of the task as uh
choosing 10 balls here times number of
possibilities placing seven balls in
exactly cells which is 18,60.
It is correctly solved by using the
inclusion exclusion principle but I must
admit I read it several times to
understand what's going on here. Let's
explain it briefly. So to scatter seven
balls into three containers there are
three to the^ of seven possibilities and
that we know it might be that that all
three containers are occupied or all
both are in one of the two containers.
So we have 3 ^ 7 gives us situations
like
some balls are here, some balls are
here, some balls are here. But also
situations like
most balls are here and two balls are
here. and 3 to the^ 7 gives us
situations like all the balls goes to
the same container because all balls
have three possibilities and may happen
that all the balls went to this box or
this cell. So 3 to the^ 7 is seven balls
in three containers in max not exactly
in max three containers. So let's light
it free uh maybe that way max three
containers
containers
are occupied.
All seven balls goes to max free
containers. Right? Seven balls
go to max free containers.
containers.
This is 3 to the^ of 7. But now we
calculated this and this as a correct
answer. But we do not want this. So we
want to subtract situations when
uh two containers are occupied. So for
example this and this
uh so first and second first and third
or second and third are occupied. We do
not want those uh solutions counted. How
many solutions like that are from
three cells? We choose two that will be
occupied and then and so dot times every
ball every of seven balls goes to one of
two containers. That is how much is this
case right? Not exactly. This is how
many cases like those are. Why? Because
we have chosen two containers, right?
For example, let's say we have chosen
this and this and we put seven balls
into those two containers. But they can
go anywhere. So we also counted
situations like that.
So 3 ^ 7 minus 3 choose 2 * 2 ^ 7
and it means that okay we have counted
those we subtracted
those situations and maybe you think
okay that's correct we we subtracted
also this situation not exactly because
we have
six possibilities let's see
uh that we have chosen those two boxes
and all balls goes here. We have chosen
those two boxes and all balls goes here.
We have chosen those two boxes and all
balls goes here. We have chosen those
two and all
balls go here and uh we have chosen
those two. All balls go here
and we have chosen those two and all
balls go here. So at the first time we
have counted the situation when all
balls are here all are here or allows
are here but then the situation that all
are here we subtracted twice not once.
So we are we need to add it once to make
it zero. That's why we need to add
to this number
uh situations when only one is occupied
and there are only three situations like
that or both are going here or here or
here and then that's the correct
solution.
This thing we need to multiply it by 5
choose three because we have five cells
and we have chosen three to analyze.
Then it is 18,60.
If you didn't understand the solution
here, don't worry. I couldn't grasp it
either. Back then when I was studying, I
definitely wouldn't have come with this
solution, with this idea. Even now it
seems unnatural to me. Even I understand
it why we subtract and add those
numbers. I presented this problem
because it can be solved much much
easier. For that we need a bit of
theory. But before that let's try to
solve it in Python and confirm the
result. See you there.
Hello. Before moving on to the
mathematical theory that will allow us
to solve this problem simply, let's see
how we might do it in Python and we may
encounter how to do it in math somehow.
Up to this point, we were just checking
the result in Python and our algorithms
wen't too much sophisticated. But now I
would like to show you the best
algorithm and how to approach to it, how
to gain to this idea. So this algorithm
will be the best I can imagine. At first
you might try on your own. You might
come up with the idea to list all the
balls. So balls are from one to seven.
Then accepted combinations would be some
type of set.
Also list out all the cells. So cells
are from 1 to five. As you remember,
if we did that, it would take us a very
long time. So, you'd have to go through
each box, each cell, just pick three
cells. So, for cell one in cells, for
cell two in cells,
for cell three in cells. Of course, um
ensure that those cells are not equal.
and with some ifs go through through all
balls and put them to those cells or go
just by balls and put them in cells.
However, it it would be torture. Another
idea I will delete that I had uh was to
use a list for our balls and index where
it went. So for example we have 1 3 2 2
4 4 it is yeah it is seven balls and
each ball is represented by the index.
So this is the first ball the second
ball the third ball the fourth ball
fifth ball sixth ball and seventh ball
and the number here represent to which
cell the ball goes. So this ball goes to
the first cell. This ball goes to the
second cell to the uh to the third cell.
Sorry, to the second to the second to
the second to the fourth to the fourth
and
another list would represent the another
situation. So for example here this or
this and this would be in color one. Uh
why? because we put them into one, two,
three, four different cells and we
needed to put them in three and now we
put them in one, two, three. So this is
correct. So it is enough to go through
all the lists
from five ones to
uh 7 ones. Sorry. 2 7 fives.
3 4 5 6 7. And in fact, you can easily
do it and count only those list that uh
have only three different numbers in
lists. That would be great. However, we
can improve that even. It doesn't matter
if we name the cells from 1 to 5 1 2 3 4
5 or from 0 to 4. Right? It is the same
idea. The number the number of
combinations would be the same. Right?
So we can have something like that. Go
through seven zeros to 7 fours. Now
going from seven zeros to seven fours,
we do not need a list at all because we
can go through seven zeros through
numbers seven zeros to 74
false
1 2 3 4 5 6 7.
So we go like this. Seven zeros.
6 zeros. 1 6 zeros 2. 6 zeros
3. 6 zeros.
Four. Then we go to six 5 zeros. 1 zero
and so on up to 4 4.
So we go from number zero which can be
written as such seven zeros to number
seven fours in base five. How much is
that? How many numbers we need to check?
You know in our decimal system we have
for example when we have 129 it is equal
to 1 100 + 2 10 + 9 1's
and for four four
in base 5 it is equal to 4 * 5 to the
power of
uh like here this is 10 to the^ of 0 10
to the^ of 1 10 to the^ of 2,000 would
be 10 to the power of 3. So it is to the
power 0 1 2 3 4 5 6
and
this is the last number that we need to
check. But here is 5 4 3 2 1 and zero.
We need we want to compute how much is
that
and print it.
So we need to check 78,125
because 7 zeros is also a number and in
that way it's not that much right so we
can do it so accepted is zero zero
accepted uh combinations so far for i in
range
the 7 8 1 2 4 it is the last number So
we want to count it as well. And now
every number I which is in decimal
representation we want to change into
base five and check how many different
digits there are. That's all. To change
it uh it would be nice to install a
numpy because numpy has a builtin
function for that. Let's go to settings.
Check here in Python interpreter if you
have installed numpy. I have but if you
have not just click this plus search for
numpy
and install the package.
Okay. So import
numpy as np. And now we want this number
i which goes from zero to 7. uh 78,124
uh we want to change it to a number as
uh
base 5. So number S5 base five but okay
mp is base representation this is the
function or method I told you
you need to put you see number and base.
So I and five for example four
let's see it
let's say for example
for 1,000 in base 5 it is how much
it is 13,000 for 129 it is
1004
So for example, I is 129 and now we have
104. We want to have seven digits. So
let's fill three like digits with zeros.
Yeah. And that's what we want. Uh from
seven zeros to seven fours. So number S5
equal number S5 Z3 because it it is
string. Maybe padding here does the same
thing. I'm not sure what is padding
here, but I know that it will work. So
now we have um we had this thing and now
we have this one. What's the problem? DL
number is five divided above without
usage of of course. Now we want this
thing change it to a set. So set of
digits
and check how many digits uh different
digits there are
set will do this automatically for us.
Let's clone it. So if len of set of
digits
is equal three then we want to
increase the accepted value and then
print accepted
value. Let's see it is 18,60
and we can print all of them or only
accepted but let's print all of them for
now.
And you can see that we are really going
from seven zeros to 74s.
Yeah. So 7 zeros to 74s.
And the next number after four is 10 in
base five. And that's how it is working.
And we only uh count or add one to
accept it when there are only three
different digits. So for example, this
means that uh the first ball went to a
cell four or fifth cell to the second
cell to the first cell to the fourth
cell to the sec to the first cell to the
fourth cell and to the second cell
because as you remember we uh changed
cells numbering by one. But this is
incorrect one, right? Because we have 1
2 3 four different digits here. And we
only count those that have three exactly
three different digits. So let's go to
one like that should be 10 10 at the
end.
For example, we counted this one because
uh we have 0 1 and four only. So both
went to three different cells. And yes,
this is the correct and easy program.
But in fact, it is slow program, a very
slow program when we would have more
than seven balls. For example, for eight
balls, it would be
we need to compute last.
Print last.
In fact, I I do not need to put it that
way. I can put last here, right? But let
let's look how much it is. Okay. And do
what I told you.
Okay. And for eight volts, it would take
some time probably. Yeah. for 9 volts.
It would be a disaster for us
because the program would work probably
a minute or something. Oh, it was 5
seconds. 5 seconds around quite quickly.
Okay, let's go back to this this one.
What I want to say that we can do it
even better because we do not need to
use numpy and change representation
to base 5 because uh because python has
a built-in solution to go through all
the numbers from seven zeros to 74 or do
just this right. So I have prepared the
second one. Uh so it stays here and we
will see how to write it differently.
From Peter tools
we import product and product is the
function that does exactly what we want.
So accepted for now is zero. And now
let's see what product does. product for
five
different
uh cells.
It is
let's name it this way and print the
list of this.
So it is only 1 2 3 4 5 nothing special.
But there is a repeat word here. It is
not told us that there is but let's
repeat it three times.
What we have? We have exactly what we
want. It goes from three once
111 1 2 1 3 11 1 4 11 1 5 and then goes
to 1 to 1. Of course, we can go from 0
to four or from 1 to 5. Maybe let's do
this this time flow once as it is in exa
in exercise two three fives
and when we repeat it not three times
but seven times
it goes to seven fives from seven ones
but probably we can't see that. Okay. So
the only thing is to go through all of
those those lists and count those ones
that we want to accept.
So
maybe we can even shorten this more for
every shuffle. I'm not sure if it is a
correct word for what we are doing for
shuffle in those
those tpples.
If len of set again we are changing it
to set so repetition will be cut off
set of current shuffle.
If it is free we want to accept that
and print how much we accepted.
That's all
some simple program. And now when we
change it to 9, we have seen that it was
around 5 seconds for the first approach.
It will take us much quicker around 2
seconds, right? I think this is the best
approach we could use. Of course, there
are some libraries that can compute it
without uh writing more than one line,
but I wanted to show it that what we are
really doing here is changing
or writing you know this uh let's go
back
this thing that first ball goes to the
third cell. Second ball goes to the
third cell. Third ball goes to the
second cell. second cell, fifth ball
goes to the fourth cell.
So what we are doing here is basically
ball one goes to
cell three. For example, ball two goes
to cell four. Ball three goes to cell
five.
Ball four goes to cell three again.
And then let's say fifth ball goes to
the cell fifth and those two goes to
three and four.
And what we are doing is seven different
numbers from 1 to 7. We map them to
three different numbers. Right? And
that's all we can understand what we
want to achieve mathematically because
we want to count all the possibilities
that seven numbers are mapped to three
other numbers. So what we want to count
is how many sjections like this are
there and that's all and for that
mathematics has mechanism even faster
than what we have achieved here. So
let's start from the next lesson. See
you there.
Hello. Now you will get familiar with
steering numbers which let us solve
problems like the ones we have seen and
are simply another tool in discrete
mathematics. Stealing numbers two or
three depending on the literature. The
third time is sometimes considered as a
stealing number as well. two or three
types of special numbers that were
studied by James Steeling. In fact, only
those two were studied by James
Steeling. Stealing numbers of the first
kind denoted by the symbols. So, so it
is denoted like N= K but in a square
brackets or S N and K in parentheses or
S1 as the first kind.
Sometimes it's also a capital S.
Nevertheless, we say n with k cycles.
Sometimes in literature, you can see
also k cycles n but mostly n with k
cycles. So if n is five and k is three,
we say five with three cycles. Those
numbers are defined by a recurrence
relation like this. So to know for
example five with three cycles, we need
to know four with three cycles as well
as four with two cycles. We haven't
discussed recurrence relations formulas
yet, but it's nothing scary or
difficult. This recurrence where to know
a value the previous one obviously can't
go on forever. So some initial results
are known from the beginning. So n with
n cycles is one. N with zero cycles is
zero. Zero cycles is one. And n with k
cycles for k greater than n is always
zero. To practice this sterling
recussion, let's compute five with three
cycles. So we have this recursion
formula here and five with three cycles
is equal to we put everywhere where five
where n is we put five and everywhere
where k is we put three. So it is 5 - 1
5 - 1 5 - 1 and 3 - 1. So it is four *
four with three cycles plus four with
two cycles and we do not know how much
is four with three cycles and four with
two cycles. So we need to compute those.
So again we put for n this time four for
k again three and we have three with
three cycles and we know that this is
always one. So this is 3 * 1 is three
and we need to compute three with two
cycles. three with two cycles. Again,
putting it n3 2 k we have 2 * 2 with two
cycles plus two with one cycle. And we
know that two with two cycles is one and
two with one cycle. We need to compute
two with one cycle is 1 * 1 with one
cycle. It is always one plus one with
zero cycles and it is always zero if n
is not zero. So it is 1 + 0. And now
once you reach a value uh an integer you
can backtrack one here then it will be
three. So the blue part will be three.
Then the green part is 3 + 3. So it is
six and then we put six here to compute
five with three cycles. So let's do
that. 3 + 3 is six. So 5 with three
cycles is 4 * 6 it is 24 plus 4 with two
cycles and we need to compute also that
item. So four with two cycles. Again
with formula we have three * 3 because
three with two cycles it was a blue part
here right? So it was three.
So it is 3 * 3 + 3 with one cycle it is
9 + three with one cycle. And this pink
part it is two. Again two with one cycle
was already computed. So it is 11. the
yellow part and finally five for three
cycles is 35.
Note you don't actually compute them
like this. That is you can but there are
certain properties that let you
calculate them the steering numbers of
the first kind faster but I wanted to
show the recursion because for bit
numbers unfortunately you have to do it
this way or similar with recursion.
Let's see the properties. First our
formula with those conditions
constraints. Second, there are certain
properties. If you have n with one
cycle, it is always n minus one
factorial. So we do not need to compute
it with recursion. Similarly, n with n
minus one cycles is always equal to n +
2. n with n minus2 cycles. It is this
formula. And we could use this to
compute five with three cycles because
then because then five is here and 5 - 2
is exactly three. And we will do that in
a second. And n with n minus 3 cycles is
n choose 3 * n choose 4. So sometimes we
can use those uh formulas to compute
stealing numbers of the first kind even
faster.
So with this formula we can ch we can
compute
five with three cycles
it is equal to we put five here and
here. K is not used because
k is equal nus 2. So we have 3 * 5 -1
/ 4
* 5 choose 3. I know 5 to three we have
uh computed this many times but let's
compute it again so it is 4 * 5 / 1 * 2
so it is 20 / 2 so it is 10 so we have
15 - 1 is 14 / 4 * 10
it is
7 here to here and this and this cancels
out as well. So it is 7 * 5. So it is
35.
Much easier way to compute it. So in
many cases you can use these shortcut
formulas. Another interesting property
is if P is a prime number then P divides
P with K cycles for every K between one
and P not including one and P. We have
seen it because five is a prime number
and five divides 35. Five divides five
with three cycles. Another interesting
property, the sum of all n with k cycles
for a given n is n factorial. So,
uh, four with zero cycles plus four with
one cycle plus four with two cycles plus
four with three cycles plus four with
four cycles.
It is four factorial 16. Well, we know
the properties. We know how to compute
at least manually stealing numbers of
the first kind. So what are the
applications? Mainly there are three of
them. First the number of ways to
arrange n numbers into k cycles is n
with k cycles. That's the origin of the
name. Uh actually they don't have to be
numbers. They can be any set elements
most often numbers. They are used as
coefficients in failing factorial and
rising factorial expansions because
those factorials have coefficients and
with k cycles and to compute other
numbers like bell numbers like law
numbers like stealing numbers of the
second kind we'll talk about all of them
later in this course we won't focus on
falling and rising factorials but we can
briefly show what they are rising
factorial
is the product written this way. So it's
not x to n power. It is n with let's say
hat with d and it is equal x * x + 1 x +
2 and so on. We multiply all those
parentheses up to n minus one and
falling factorial is the same but in
parenthesis with a minus that is falling
and rising factorials are polomials. So
you can see that uh rising factorial 5
is just x * x + 1 x + 2 x + 3 x + 4
without x + 5 falling is the same with
minuses. If you calculate you will get
such a polomial here and here the same
numbers just different opposite sign and
it turns out those numbers 1 10 35 50 24
are first kind stealing numbers. For
example, here we have five with three
cycles, right? Five because of this,
three because of this, five with three
cycles was 35. And that's true. These
coefficients, if you didn't want to
expand or compute, are known from the
beginning because they are stealing
numbers of the first kind. That's what
they are for here. And note, some
introduce first kind steing numbers with
alternating sign. So you don't have to
subtract here because they are negative
themselves. For five with one cycle
it is a positive number. Five with two
cycles it is negative number and so on.
In my course as in some publications we
only count positive still numbers and
place the minus sign when we want to use
a negative. Both approaches are
essentially equivalent. But the most
important use of the student numbers of
the first kind is for us the number of
ways to arrange n numbers in k cycles.
What does it mean to arrange n numbers
in k cycles? The first lesson in this
course first real one explaining things
from chapter one. So lesson two I I
guess as I remember about factorials and
permutations talked about cycles. To
recap, I just copied from that
presentation. A cycle is any permutation
of the form 1 3 to 4 31 4 52. Thisation
consists of two distant cycles. One of
length two and one of length 3. We can
write it as 1 3 2 4 5 or with a circle
here, but it doesn't matter. A
permutation with no smaller cycle. that
is one that moves all elements in a
single closed loop is itself a single
cycle. So it was in the first
presentation. So the first uh cycle is
one goes to three and then three goes to
one and the second it was cycle of the
length two and the second cycle of the
length three. We have two goes to four,
four goes to five and five goes to two.
And this is the same two goes to four,
four goes to five, five goes to two.
That's what we talk about. And the
question is we have five numbers. In how
many ways can we put five numbers into
three cycles? Here we put them in two
cycles but it could be three. The answer
is 35. There are 35 ways to write five
numbers in three cycles. If you want you
can write them all out. In the course I
include a problem enrolling all these
cycles. Instead of commas I use spaces.
Doesn't matter. So for example the first
answer means 1 2 3 4 5. So one goes to
one. So it is in the first one it is the
same as writing
one goes to one second goes to second
three goes to four to five and five to
three.
We have three cycles. One of the length
one
of the length one and one of the length
three. Another one for example 22. It is
like this one three. So we have one goes
to three, three goes to one, right? One
goes to three. Three goes to one. Two
goes to four
and two goes to four and four goes to
two and five goes to five. So we have
two cycles of the length two and one
more. One cycle of the length one.
That's three cycles and indeed there are
35 ways. Stealing numbers of the first
kind will not be used for our problem
with putting balls into specific number
of cells that given number of cells are
occupied. It's a very interesting part
of discrete mathematics mainly related
to permutations. For our problem, we
will need at least the second kind of
steel numbers and possibly the third
one. But I didn't want to jump straight
to the second kind without covering the
first. even if they are not connected
too much. But before that, let's try
coding the computation of first kind
sting numbers in Python or any other
programming language to see how to code
the recursion. What are the things that
you need to remember coding those and
yes see you there.
Hello. Now let's learn about recursion.
Most often recussion is introduced when
introducing factorials. We didn't do
that since Python has a built-in
mechanism to compute factorials called
factorial. But we could have done it. So
let's do it right now. So you know five
factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 and we
can calc it that way. So def factorial
the first approach this initially the
result is one result equal to one
if n is one or n is zero then return
this result or return one it doesn't
matter and then when it is five we need
to go through all the numbers from 1 to
five and uh multiply them together. So
for i in range from 1 to n + one because
we want to include n five. So that's how
we write it in python. And then result
times equal i and return the result. So
i is 1 then i is 2 then i is 3 4 5 and
the result increases. Let's check if
this if this is correct. So print
factorial of five it should be 120
and it is.
And now the cion there is a second
approach to uh to write this code. So 5
factorial
is the same as 5 * 4 factorial right
because 4 factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 and
then * 5
and 4 factorial
uh it is
the same as 3 factorial because 3
factorial is 1 * 2 * 3 then * 4 then *
five.
We repeat this uh idea because 3
factorial is
3 * 2 factorial. Then two factorial is 2
*
1 factorial and one factorial is 1. So
this is one.
So 2 * 1 is 2.
Then 3 * 2 is 6.
4 * 6 is 24. We have wrong number of
parentheses.
It should be like this
here. This way
4 * 6 is 24 and then 5 * 24 is 120.
So uh the cushion goes like this. You go
in with deeper and deeper parenthesis
and then you come out
from the deepest one to outside.
Let's uh write it out. So we have
we have the factorial two
the parameter is uh not number. Of
course the code could be better because
we could check if n is natural if n is
integer if n is a positive number and so
on. But uh we want to understand the
algorithm behind recursion only. So if n
is=
1 or n is= zero return one. Here the
exit condition for a recursive function
should usually be right at the top. And
now to compute the factorial you need to
multiply n times factorial of the number
one less. So we return n * factorial
n minus one. And that's it. The code is
sorted. At least it is sorted. So let's
check if the
answer is the same. It should be 120.
And yes it is.
There are some problems with this code.
For example, when you put 9,000 here,
it will say that recursion error max
recursion depth exceeded because there
is a fixed number of recursion that we
can go through. And if you want to
increase that number, you go to input s
and say recussion limit. Set recussion
limit. We cannot put infinite recussion.
So we need to put some big number
not the bug but I wanted to run it
and there is one more problem we've
exceeded the limit of all integers in
conversion so
uh set in max mark max stig zero
and now it works okay there is another
problem with this code not only that
that uh we need to set the crucial limit
for just this function and that's not
the case for the first factorial but we
see this problem that I have in my head
when we program stealing uh numbers for
the of the first kind but for now just
understand that recussion is calling
function by itself.
So let's recall the recussion formula
for steering numbers of the first kind.
It is n k = to n -1
* n -1 k
with k cycles plus
n minus one k minus one. So we have two
uh branches of the recussion here
because oh it should be this type of
bracket
uh because once we go here and the
second we go here
and now and the steering of the first
kind
and then k it needs two parameter. If n
is equal to k then return one if k is
zero then return zero. If k is more than
n return zero. In fact, we can combine
those two
writing end here. It will be shorter.
And then when the initial condition are
written, we put return
n minus one time steering of the first
kind n minus one k plus steering of the
first kind n minus one k minus one. And
we can print our steer link 53. It
should be 35 as you remember.
Oh, of course not and by but or sorry
for that
35. It is 35. And now we would like to
compute
steering of for example 50 and 30.
Let's try this.
And it's computed quite long, right?
Probably we can't wait for the result.
So let's stop it and see how this
sterling 53 is working and why it is so
so slow. So
I debug this code
and we have steering one five and three
n is not equal k is not greater than or
it is not zero then we have this code
and here it is 4 * stealing 1 4 and k3
and it will not use execute this code
yet and it's like I said so we go deeper
then we have 33 it is one and then we
have N4 K3
and so on and we go deeper and deeper as
it goes back to K3 and N5.
Then it will go to the second still link
to 42
and again it will compute those things
again
even if n3 and k2 was here
was already computed 2 and two was
already computed
so we shouldn't go here
but it goes reculusively here and then
recursively here. And that's why we need
to go now back to five
53 again
how many
um computations that are you can see and
now we have it. It went down here many
times. It went down here many times.
Then went back went back and now we are
at home. It will be 35. So you can see
that when computing for example 20 and
15 it probably take some time
305 let's check it
and yes uh it can work more than a
minute probably
we can wait for that
and I have a result after around half a
minute so let's check how long This
function is working.
So
from time input P counter
let's start counting the measure the
time here.
Let's stop doing it here
and then print
it took
stop minus start
rounded to two decimal places seconds.
Let's check it. It took 22 seconds.
And now we would like to lower the
complexity of this function forcing it
to use previous values if they were
already obtained. How to do it? Python
has a built-in decorator for that. So we
just uh import it from
fun tools import. It can be lu cache or
just cache when we do not care how many
variables we want to remember and then
we need to use it like this
and that's all. Now if something was
once computated then the value will be
stored and then uh received from the
cache.
It will be not computated twice the same
thing. Let's check how much how long it
will take now to compute sterling of the
first kind of 305.
It took 0 seconds and with cash now we
can compute stealing for 300 and 200
easily.
it took 100th of second. So what I
wanted to show here is not a programming
lesson. Uh it is that how the recussion
works. It goes deeper and deeper by
definition.
Calls the same function, the same idea
in mathematics but with mostly smaller
numbers down to constraint like n= k k k
k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k
k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k
equals z or something like that and then
it sails out. And the second thing that
I wanted to mention is that when using
the recursion in mathematics or in
programming, it is really important to
use previously computated values. And we
did it in our presentation. You remember
those colors, right? I haven't computed
the same color twice. I've just used uh
values that were previously computed. So
those are things that it is good to
remember. Okay, that's all in this
lesson.
We continue our introduction to steering
numbers. We already know this steering
numbers of the second kind denoted by
the symbols n subset k. Right away we
more or less know what will be
calculated. It's marked with a curly
bracket symbol. Again they are defined
by a recurrence formula very similar to
the last one. We see that the only
difference is the coefficient. Instead
of n minus one for first kind stealing
numbers we have k for second kind
steering numbers and we also have the
same conditions exactly the same as for
the first kind. However, there's one
additional condition for first kind
numbers. N cycle one was n minus one
factorial. But but here n subset one is
one. Again let's see an example
calculating five subset 3 that is we
will write 3 as k and break it into two
cases. I won't write all the
calculations now. So I use the formula
that is in the right top corner. three
here and three here and five 5 - 1 is
four I already calculated that again we
compute each component three subset
three is just one so 3 * 1 is three we
need to compute three subset 2 subset 2
is 1 and two subset 1 is 1 so it is
three so for the green part we have six
so 3 * 6 it is 18 and we need to compute
four subsets two and for four subset two
we have basically computed that already.
So it's seven. So the result is 25. Yes,
you can remember that ceiling numbers of
the second kind are always less than or
equal to stealing numbers of the first
kind. The properties are our recurrence
formula. Also when k is equal n minus
one, it is the same case as for stealing
numbers of the first kind. It is n + 2.
For n subset 2, we have 2 ^ of n -1 n
-1.
And n subset 3, we have this formula.
And this is exactly what we just
calculated. So we can calculate it with
this formula. So
5 subset 3 is
uh 3 to the power of 5 - 1 is 4. So 3 ^
of 4 everything will be divided by 2 - 2
^ of 5 + 1 3 ^ of 4 is 81 - 2 ^ 5 is 32
+ 1 / 2 81 + 1 is 82 - 32 is 50
divided by 2. So it is 25.
So we can use this formula. But most
importantly unlike first kind sting
numbers there is a formula for all
second kind steering numbers and it is
this. The formula looks complicated but
this one looks equally intimidating but
really it just looks that way. If you
want you can compute any value from this
formula but we know the value for five
subset 3. It is 25. So, so it is
five subset three.
We have I k 3. So, it is -1 to the power
3 - 0 is 3 * 0 to the power of 5. But it
will be zero no matter what we have
here. And yes, you can remember that
here is i =0 or i = 1. It is the same
because um here for zero it will always
be zero. And now -1 to the power I is 1.
3 - 1 is 2
* 1 ^ 5 / k - i. So 2
factorial 1 factorial +
- 1 to the power 3 to now 1
I is 2 so 2 ^ 5 /
1 factorial 2 factorial
plus let's go here
- 1 ^ 0 * 3 ^ 5
uh 0 factorial and i is three. So three
factorial it is equal to this part is
zero. This part is 1 * 1 / 2
plus this part is -1 * 2 ^ 5 is 32.
So - 42 / 2
plus
uh here 3 to the^ 4 is 81. So * 3 is
233.
233
divided by 6. So we have
1 / 2 - 16 +
this cancels all by three. So it is 2
and here is 81.
So 81 by 2 and 81 by 2 + 1 is 82.
T / 2 is 31
- 16 it is 25. So you can use this
formula for all n and k say n
137 k5 and it is easy to compute. we
don't need to use recursion and above
all there's a formula converting
stealing numbers of one kind to the
another kind. So stealing numbers of the
first kind can be written as this sum
where here are used steeling numbers of
the second kind and the same for the
second kind where here are stealing
numbers of the first kind and the
formula stays the same only those
brackets are changed and uh as we said
second kind numbers are always less than
or equal to the first kind. Now the most
important part. What are the
applications of stealing numbers of the
second kind? The number of ways to
partition n element set into k non empty
subset is equal to n subset k. We won't
analyze this but the number of
equivalence relations with exactly k
equivalence classes that can be defined
on an n element set is n subset k. Also
when calculating bell numbers also in
the formula for converting a power say 5
to the 7th power into falling powers or
upper factorials. What matters for us
basically is this and you should already
see the connection with our ultimate
problem. The one we started from the
section example. In how many ways can we
place five distinguishable balls into
four boxes so that each box or container
contains at least one ball? Namely the
answer is five subset 4. We call the
formula we use the formula. So four
subset 4 is 1. So it is 4 + 4 subset 3
and four subset 3 can be computed from
the last formula
and it is 10. So in how many ways can
one put five distinguishable balls in
four boxes so that each has at least one
exactly 10 ways and these ways are as
follows. We notice that there is no
combination 1 2 3 5 4 exactly the same.
It is the same combination. Reordering
elements in one set doesn't matter
because the order of both in a box
doesn't matter. We apply this when the
elements are distinguishable. The order
inside a given subset does not matter.
This is exactly what I've just said. And
the order of the subset does not matter.
So 1 2 3 4 is the same as 2 4 3 1. So we
can reorder the subsets boxes containers
and it's still the same situation with
the help of the second kind steering
numbers. We can now solve our problem.
If you want you can try to do this
yourself. We will still speak about
stealing numbers of the first kind or
what are usually called l numbers and
only then we will solve our problem.
Okay, see you in the next one.
Discovered about 200 years after
Sterling's death, L numbers are often
called stealing numbers of the third
kind. Yeah. Discovered by evil in 1954.
They originally allowed expressing the
rising factorial using the falling
factorial and vice versa. They are given
by a reasonably manageable formula like
this one and they are often written
similarly to n to k or ceiling number of
the first kind or second but with square
brackets without the upper part. It
looks like a floor symbol. In
mathematics the floor function also has
that L shape on both sides. So it is n
minus one choose k -1 * n factorial / k
factorial and it is defined for n
greater than or equal k greater than or
equal 1. For other cases it is either
zero or one. Let's immediately see the
fundamental application. And the rising
factorial can be expressed using the
falling factorial or the falling
factorial can be expressed using the
rising factorial. Let's see. Remember
that the rising factorial for five is
the first polomial. The falling
factorial for five is the second
polomial. They are the same just
different signs. If you want to write
the rising factorial using the falling
factorial, you just go through k= 1 2 3
4 up to 5. So we substitute. So for one
we have 51
x one falling factorial which is just x.
Then k is equal to 2 it is l 52
and uh falling factorial it is this part
x x -1
then 53 x x -1 x - 2 it is third falling
factorial and so on and so on at the
last I haven't written L 55 because it
is one and then we can compute usually
lo 51 52 53 54 four. So this is that and
we expressed rising factorial in terms
of the falling factorial. This
application is not very important for us
but it was the original one. That's what
Evol analyzed. So now why are they
called stealing numbers of the third
kind? There are several reasons. One is
there is a formula connecting stealing
numbers of the first kind and the second
kind as we see. So if you want to
compute L number 32
L number 32
it is J is equal K [snorts] which is
two. So it is three
with two cycles. Three with two cycles
times J is equal 2 and K is equal to. So
it is 2 subset 2
plus
then J is = 3. So we have three with
three cycles
times
J is= 3. So three subset two
and okay this is not the best bracket
but this is the formula but that's not
the only reason another reason is that l
number have a recursive formula almost
identical to the formulas for string
numbers of the first kind or second kind
again the only difference is in the
coefficient now it is n + k minus one
for l number n1 it is n factorial just
like for ceiling numbers of the first
kind. Note I will sometimes use this
notation sometimes that one depending on
how the formula proceeds but most
important for us is how l numbers are
used applications of lock numbers. So we
know that expressing the rising
factorial in terms of the following
factorial and vice versa computing
certain sums of products that involves
both student numbers of the first kind
and student numbers of the second kind.
We have seen this but above all counting
the number of ways to partition an n
element set into k non- empty linearly
ordered subsets. Now to put it in
simpler words, the number k specifies
how many subset appear in the partition
but not the sizes. Just like for string
numbers of the first kind five with
three cycles, three cycles is not the
length of cycles but the number of
cycles within each subset. The order of
elements matters while the order of the
subsets themselves does not. And that's
what we want to analyze and understand.
Example log for one is just four
factorial which is 24 because there are
24 partitions of a four element set into
one subset namely they are the
permutations
when one is in front the rest permutate
we have six cases and the same for two
three and four when it is on the
beginning. So the subset is the whole
set but order matters. Now L 42 let's
compute that's 36. Now let's analyze
possible partitions of four element set
into two subsets are as follows. First
both subsets are of size two or one
subset is of size three and one is of
size one. Let's analyze both. If both
subsets are of size two, we have 1 2 3 4
and 2 1 3 4 because the order in set for
L numbers only matters. The same if in
the second set is it is not 3 four but
four three. So we have four. So we have
four partitions so far. And the same if
it is not 1 2 but 1 3 1 3 2 4 3 3 1 2 4
and the same for four 2. And the same
when in the first set it is 1 4. There
is no more because 2 3 and 1/4 is the
same as 1 4 2 3. The order of the subset
themselves does not matter only numbers
in subsets. And we have the second case.
So when one subset has only one element
one the other permutates and there are
six possibilities and the same for
situations where there are two three or
four elements in a single element set
right when instead of one here there is
two three or four then again we have six
possibilities so in total we have 12
here and 6 * for 36 partitions and let's
compute also log 43. There are also 12
partitions of a four element set into
three subsets. One must be one element,
a second one must be one element and the
third one must have two elements and
there is no more. It is important to
notice that partitions such as 1 4 2 3
is the same as four 1 2 3 or when we put
this to three between 1 and four it is
the same all are considered equal in the
sense of l numbers. So the order of sets
does not matter. the order of numbers in
sets. Thus, thus what we are really
analyzing here is the number of ways to
place four balls in general n balls into
three boxes in general k boxes in such a
way that the order of the boxes does not
matter but the order of the balls within
each box does matter. And that's the
difference from steering numbers of the
second kind. In L numbers, the order of
the boxes doesn't matter, but the order
of balls in a box does. In steering
numbers of the second kind, order of
boxes doesn't matter either, nor does
order of balls within a box. So here for
this example, it's half possibilities
because 1 2 3 4 and 1 2 4 3 are
considered the same in stealing numbers
of the second kind. the same 1 3 2 4 and
1 3 4 2 and so on. So for the stealing
numbers of the second kind those are
partitions we have six of them. For
stealing numbers of the second kind for
subset two the result is seven. Since
there are four possibilities when single
tone one element set is one or two or
three or four and the order of numbers
in the second set does not matter. And
when we divide it
for numbers into two subsets we have
three possibilities. 1 2 3 4 1 3 2 4 1 4
2 3 So for L numbers we had here 24
possibilities
and for here for 1 2 3 4 and for numbers
of the second kind we have only four
because the order does not matters. So
we divide 24 which is the number for L
numbers
by three factorial which is six and
that's why there is four and for L
numbers we had 12 possibilities here for
partitioning four elements to two
subsets
and uh we divided by two factorial here
because the order for cing numbers of
the second kind does not matter. and two
factorial here. So we have 2 factorial *
2 factorial which is 3. And that's why 4
+ 3 is 7. So those are very related to
remembering numbers count k subsets of n
element set which no concern for order
of boxes nor for order of balls. L
numbers and K. No concern for boxes
order, but order of balls in a box
matters. That's now enough to solve our
problem in an easy way. Maybe you have
forgotten what our problem was, but we
will remind it in the next lesson. See
you there.
Hello. We return to the task. Let's
recall calculating how many ways seven
numbered balls can be placed into five
cells numbered 1 2 3 4 and five so that
exactly three cells are occupied.
The traditional solution three to seven
is how to arrange seven balls in three
cells in general but from that we must
subtract the situation where the seven
balls are placed in only two cells.
That's here, right? But then we have
counted twice the case where the seven
balls are in one cell and that must be
added again. We uh calculated it here,
presented it here. So, so from five
cells we choose three multiply by that
and we have 18,60.
We confirmed it programmatically but it
wasn't clear what exactly we had done.
This time we will use stealing numbers.
So we will check if it is easier and if
the result is the same essentially the
same
stealing numbers of the second kind. But
let's place this thing lower.
See this
solution here.
So again, stealing numbers of the second
kind. Maybe we'll use the same color
this time. All the luck numbers both
assume that boxes cells cannot be empty.
That's good because that's what we want.
So again, we choose three out of five
cells. So
five choose three. Those three will be
occupied. Now we multiply this and
consider how to place seven balls into
three boxes. So we have three boxes
or cells
and uh that is essentially how to split
these seven balls into three sets
regardless of how many elements are in
each and these are steering numbers of
the second kind. So this is steering of
the second type
uh where n is seven and we have three
sets
because three cells. This is not the end
because we remember that in steering
numbers of the second kind. We had that
situation in the previous uh or previous
to last presentation. We know that the
order of those cells does not matter in
stealing numbers of the second kind.
Just as the order of the balls does not
matter and we already assumed the order
of the balls does not matter. So these
are not L numbers. For example,
one
2
3
four and five is ex is exactly as one
2
3
five and four. We assume that uh but in
still linking numbers the arrangement of
these boxes also does not matter. So
these are the same.
Uh but it is not our case. uh we rather
claim that this is not the same this and
this or this with this one right in
first cell we have one element in second
cell we have one element here and here
but here two elements so for us it is
different and in numbers of the second
kind those three are the same. So if we
want to compute include in fact those
rearrangements we need to multiply it by
the number of permutations and it is
three factorial and that's it. That
should be the correct result. Let's
check it. 5 to 3 is like 5 to 2. So 4 *
5 / 1 * 2 uh times we can compute it or
check it because it is constant value so
we can check it on Wikipedia steering
numbers of the second kind
and we have the sting number n7 K3 is
301
it is 31
and 3 factorial is six. So we compute
that this is 2. So it is 10
*
6 0 * 6 is 0. 3 * 6 is 18. So in fact it
is 18,60.
And now we should understand how we
computed it. We have chosen three cells
out of five. Then we considered in how
many ways we can rearrange those uh
seven balls in three sets and we wanted
to include information that those cells
are not free and they cannot shuffle and
it is not the same uh combination. If we
think that it is the same it's just not
multiplying by six by three factorial
right and we should write it here that
we think that in this uh exercise
positions of the cells does not matter
but I think that cells uh position of
cells does matter. However, we uh we
assumed that uh that those uh numbers in
one cell the they can be placed anyhow
that they shuffle inside.
But maybe it's not the case. Maybe those
arrangements does matter but those as
well. Then we have L numbers. So again
we choose three cells out of five and
then multiply it by L 73 and multiply it
or not by three factorial. It depends
how we understand the problem right. So
this problem, this exercise is not
precise. I would say if seven number
balls that are in cells, if this order
does matter or not. So if it if it does
then it is lock numbers and then we
could compute it.
Uh again we need to check how much is
lock number 73. Of course we could use
um a direct formula. You can see here
additionally lock numbers are sometimes
referred to as string numbers of the
third kind. That's what I have said.
We have this formula but we also have a
table of values. So log 73 is 12,600
12,600
* 6. So it is again 10
and uh this thing 0 0
6 * 6 is 36 three are going here 6 * 2
is 12 so 15 1 6 * 1 is 6 so 7 so then it
is 756,000
and that's all okay but it was just as
as a matter of curiosity
some fun fact that we could understand
this exercise differently and then
easily compute that using clock numbers.
However, there is one more way maybe
even easier. In fact, it is the same way
but uh told differently one more one
more way to calculate this. Do you
remember in programming we were checking
how many
um lists there are that I'm not sure how
it was but um from we have checked from
seven ones to 73 or something like that
three is not seven
and compute only those that uh have
exactly three different uh digits here.
In other words, we were checking
how many functions there are that for
seven
different
values. In fact, one value from the set
uh of seven values. But it doesn't
matter. I only want to give you an idea
how many functions there are that the
results are from sets
uh only from three
possible values right so this is a
question how many subjections like that
are there
so uh the number of possibilities is we
have we need to choose of course three
cells out of five and then times how
many subjections there are that seven
balls are put into three sets that every
cell is occupied and this is sjection.
So we we want to know number of
[clears throat] subjections.
Number
of subjections like that
like that.
But for that it there is a special
formula.
So we can see it on Wikipedia. We need
to go back to the string numbers of the
second kind.
And it is mentioned somewhere here.
Yes. Uh this can [clears throat] this
formula
this explicit formula this can be
derived by using inclusion exclusion to
count the subjections from n to k and
using the fact that the number of such
suggestions is k factorial times n
subset k. It's exactly what we want. So
the number of subjections like that we
know how many balls and we know how many
values and every value need to be used
is just let's check K factorial.
So
3 factorial time seven subset three.
It's exactly the same as here. But we
know now that if we can solve the
problem programmatically by using those
lists that we were generating, we can
count them with this uh formula.
And of course, we need to choose three
cells out of five. There is no matter of
the order of choosing it. Okay, that's
all for this lesson. Now we have tools
for solving problems like that. Let's
move on to the last few lessons.
Hello. We won't focus on bell numbers or
many others because knowing stealing
numbers somehow means we know bell
numbers. For now, let's write that bell
numbers denoted by B with index n are
given by a recursive formula like this.
To calculate B3, we need to first
calculate B 0, B1, B2. Because from K =
0 to N minus one, we sum binomial
coefficient times the corresponding B
number. Again the conditions of the
requisite formula apply here. Here B 0 =
1, B1 = 1. You can also remember that B2
= 2. This is also easy. B1 1, B2. This
formula can be written like here or it
can be alternately written like this. So
then from k= 0 to n this uh is easier
but then we have b n + 1 it doesn't
matter. Let's take an example and
calculate b5 the fifth bell number.
According to the formula, we need to
calculate 4 choose 0 * b 0 plus 4 choose
1 b1 and so on up to be4. We have
calculated all binomial coefficients
without problem. 4 to 0 is 1, 4 is 4, 4
is 6, 4 is 4, and 4 is 1. Now we need to
calculate b2. B2 with this formula is 1
choose 0 B 0 + 1 choose 1 B1 this is 1 +
1 so it is really two and the same with
B3 to calculate B3 we need we need to
know how much is B 0 B1 and B2 but
everything is computed 1 one and two so
it is five five because two two choose
one is two and B1 is one then before in
the same way it is 15 and when we know
B2, B3, B4, we can apply those numbers
to formula for B5. So it is 52. These
numbers are obviously constants. So you
can memorize spell numbers 1 1 2 5 15
and 52. B5 is always 52. As you see,
they grow very fast. As I said, knowing
steering numbers, we know bell numbers.
Look at properties. This is our formula
for bell numbers. But there is another
namely B numbers are simply sum of
stealing numbers of the second kind for
given n. From that formula to calculate
our will be five. It is enough to
calculate five subset zero five subset
one five subset two and so on. However,
uh everything subset 0 not zero subset
zero is zero and 0 subset 0 is one. But
let's write it like it is. So it is five
subset zero
plus five subset 1
+ 5 subset 2
and so on up to five.
You can see that here is n and here is n
minus one. Right? Okay. So the five
subset zero like I said it is zero plus
five subset one everything subset one is
one
five subset two we have already computed
it it was 15 this is 25 I've of course
just write it down from the table
and it is really 15 + 25 is 40 50 52
two.
As mentioned before, ser numbers of the
first kind also have application here
and here we see it. Proper sum of B
numbers can be presented using steering
numbers of the first kind. We also have
congruences. So for example, calculate
B8.
B8 is
B3 + 5
and it congruent to
U B5
plus B6 modulo 3 modulo
3. So it is not available. It is not the
result but we know that B8 and B5 + B6
has the same remainder when dividing by
3. And now we get to what interests us
most applications of bell numbers. We
have mainly one application bell number
bn determines the number of partitions
of an n element set. So for n equals z
it is assumed that the empty set has
only one partition to the empty set.
This is the same for one element set
that it is uh one element set the only
partition. For n equal to we have the
partitions the whole set one two so
there is no partition and one and two
one partitions we have two partitions
let's analyze an example where we can
see what's going on for n equals three
partitions we have five partitions one
the whole set so there is no partition
at all but it is a partition right there
is no partition like a line vertical
line here free partition partitions
where there is one element set and one
two element set and one partition where
there are three one element sets. The
count is five. The bell number third
number bell is five which equals what we
would calculate using steering numbers.
Namely here we have
uh it is n3. So it is steering number of
the second kind. Three subsets one. It
is one.
Here we have
three subsets two.
And here we have three subset three
which is one. For any cool fall, we have
the partitions of the set 1 2 3 4 into
15 sets. Uh, in fact, those curly braces
should be also here and here and in many
other places. I just omitted them like
many others do. We have one four element
set. We have some partitions when there
are two sets. One of the size one and
one of the size three and three
partitions with division into two
subsets two of size two. Next divide
into three sets. There are six
possibilities. And finally divide the
set into four sets all singletons. This
really are string numbers. One partition
for four elements. It is the number four
subset one. seven partitions into two
subset. We computed that it was seven,
right? Seeing number of the second kind
for the two and steering number of the
second kind for three was six and only
one partition of four subset of four. If
you go to Wikipedia on string numbers of
the second kind and uh if you want to
compute bell numbers that is how many
partitions of an n element set say five
elements there are we just need to sum
those numbers 1 + 15 + 25 + 10 + 1. So
for B8 instead of recursive calculation
we just add 1 + 127 966 and so on and so
on + 28 + 1. That's why we don't focus
on bell numbers because usually when we
want to calculate really the bell number
we compute sum of stealing numbers of
the second kind. Okay and that's all for
this lesson. See you in the next one.
Hello. The last topic we will discuss in
this course will be the Chinese
remainder theorem. The Chinese remainder
theorem allows for solving systems of
congruences of co-prime numbers.
Everything will become clear shortly but
we should already be familiar with words
like congruence meaning reminders from
division and co-prime numbers meaning
those that have only one common divisor
which is one. Chinese mathematician
Sununzi solved the problem of finding
integers that give remainders of 2,
three and two when divided by three,
five and seven respectively. So when
divided by three they leave remainder
two divided by five remainder three and
divided by 7 remainder two as well. And
these numbers three, five and seven
besides being prime are above all
co-prime. The reminders 232 do not have
to be co-prime numbers. In various
sources, Sununzi lived at different
times spanning around 200 years, but he
lived somewhere at the beginning of our
era. So in other words, Sunzi solved the
problem of finding a number n that
satisfies all three congruences at the
same time. So there is a number n that
divided by 3 gives leander 2 / 5 gives
leander 3 divided by 7 gives leander 2.
We can solve this problem now and we
introduce the Chinese remainder theorem
by solving this problem exactly as sunzi
came to it. solution to solve it for
each of these rows meaning here for
three division by three we need to
calculate the product of other moduli so
5 * 7 is 35 if there were more lines
here one would have to calculate the
product of more such numbers so n1 is 5
* 7 35 similarly for the second row for
five we calculate the product of the
others that is 3 * 7 is 21 and the last
one for 7 3 * 5 is 15. Next we know that
co-prime numbers that is three is
co-prime number to five and seven and is
also co-prime to their product. So when
the number is co-prime with the rest of
numbers it is also co-prime with their
product. So three is co-pime with five,
three is coine with seven. So three is
co-prime with 35 as well.
Five is co-prime with 21 and seven is
co-prime with 15. So for now we only
calculate some products. And now for
fixed co-prime n that are positive
inteious positive natural numbers. We
can find numbers a and b any integers
such that a n + b m is equal to 1. This
was in the lesson about co-prime numbers
that co-prime numbers are those whose
only common divisor is one. But also
co-line number n m positive integers are
those that we can find integers a and b
that this sum is equal one. And here our
n is the given modular number the one we
divided by which is three and m is the
number n1. So 35. So we want to find a1
and b1. Similarly for the second and the
third row right. So this number comes
from here and this number comes from
here. And the the last will be seven
here and 15 here. Right? Because they
are co-prime numbers. We can write these
three equations. So for now we only
computed products and we load those
three equations. Now these equations
need to be solved which is basically
always simple. Namely we take 135
and some numbers of threes to have 1.
Indeed 12 free is 36 and - 135 is 1. So
12 * 3 - 1 35. And similarly with the
others here 4 5 is 20. So it is easy to
have 21
121 and -4 5 right and similarly here
because 27s is 14 so it is easy to have
one. So those equations are always
simple and now we should always proceed
this way. So we take those numbers that
weren't involved so far at all. Right?
We take this number and multiply them
times this part. We ignore this part.
This part and this part. Those are
ignored. And we compute the sum. This
multiply by this. This multiply by by
this. This multiply by this. So 3 * 1 *
21. And now will be 2 * 1 * 15. And it
is 23. And this is the correct result.
Namely, 23 / 3 gives the remainder 2. 23
/ 5 gives the remainder 3. And 23 / 7
gives the remainder two. Everything
matches. But this is not the only
result. As I mentioned, I hope there are
infinitely many results, infinitely many
solutions. And how to find the others?
It is also easy. Just calculate the
number m which is the product of all
moduli 3 * 5 * 7 in our case it is 105
and all the results are 23 plus any
number of 105. It can be one it can be
two it can be minus one and so on. So n
can be 23 as we checked 23 is the answer
but 23 + 105 which is 128 is also the
solution because 128 / 3 gives the
remainder 2. 128 / 5 gives the remainder
3 and 128 / 7 gives the remainder 2. +
105 it is 233.
It is also the solution. 338
is a solution and 433 is a solution. And
when we compute the difference 23 - 105
which is
105 - 23 it is 82. So it is - 82. It is
also a solution. And there are
infinitely many solutions and we found
all of them. It is 23 plus or minus any
number of 105 2 105 3 105 and so on and
so on. So we have found all the
solutions and what is the Chinese
reminder theorem about? Because we
haven't said anything about it. This
theorem states that all solutions to a
system of congruences involving co-prime
numbers where the divisor are co-prime
can be obtained using the following
algorithm. So this is a system of
congruences and let's describe this
algorithm for the congruence system like
this one. It is a system of congruences
of any length where the only condition
is that the greatest common divisor gd
of all pairs and one with n2 and two and
n3 and so on is always one that is these
numbers are co-prime we can say we can
write it that the condition is that gcd
and one and two is equal to one Or we
can write that n2 and n3 n1 and n3 and
so on. So we can write that gcd
n i and n j always equal one for any
for any
i not equal to j. Right? And of course
uh I and uh J
I and J are
between K and one right. So this is the
only condition that those mod must be
called prime. So for the system of such
congruences where we look for one number
n in fact infinitely many but on the
beginning we are searching for one
number we have a list of remainders
those and a list of co-prime numbers we
calculate m which is a product of all
modul numbers we calculate n i which is
product of n1 n2 and n k but not
including n I do you remember that it
was
let's go here here N1 was 35 because it
was product of all those moduli not
involving three n2 was 21 because it was
product of all moduly number numbers
without five and the same with n3 which
was product of all those numbers 3 *
five and we could compute first m as
product of all and then n1 is this
product divided by three. n_sub_2 is
this product divided by 5 and n3 is this
product divided by 7. It is also the
way. So we could first compute m and
then divide by three by five by 7 and
then have n1 n2 and n3. So for this
system of congruences we compute m we
compute n i which is m this product
divided by specific row for each n i we
find such a i and b i that this equation
equals to one and it is always simple to
do. Then we have a particular solution.
The particular solution is this number
times this time this plus this number *
this times this and so on. We remember
that
it was here
2 * -1 * 35 + 3 * 1 * 21 + 2 * 1 * 15.
Right?
So we we do that. We could write this
formula in other way n s because it is a
sum right. So this is sum from i = 1 to
k
r i * b i * l i.
So this is the same and this is
particular solution. So it solves the
system and the general solution after
calculating a specific concrete one.
This is why it is s specific one. It is
that specific solution specific solution
plus some number of m which was computed
here 1 m 2 m 3 m and so on. T
is an integer and I used T because K was
used here. So knowing the Chinese remand
theorem. Chinese theorem states that
doing always this algorithm we obtain
the global solution. We obtain all the
solutions. Knowing that example of
problem there are 100 soldiers in the
unit. Most of them reported for assembly
when the command count off by threes. I
hope that's what the commander says. So
soldiers say 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 and so
on. When this command was given, the
counting ended with the number two. When
the command count of by force was given,
the counting ended with the number one.
When the command count off by five was
given, the counting ended with the
number four. How many soldiers were
present? Can we calculate how many
soldiers were there without counting
them with just this information? Yes, we
can. We have a system of congruences
because when there was count of by
threes and the counting end with the
number two. So, it was two remainder.
The the same with uh count by false the
remainder was one counted uh ended with
the number one and the same with count
by five. So it is modulo five and the
remainder was four. And we need to solve
this system of equations. This system of
congruences we compute n1 n2 and n3. It
is easy. 4 * 5 is 20. 3 * 5 is 15. 5 * 4
is 12. Then we compute m as product of
all those modul. We write those three
equations.
It is easy to solve 20. So for threes it
is 7 freeze. Then - 120 it is 1. So we
solve those three equations easily. Then
we compute 2 * -1 * 20 1 * -1 * 15 4 *
-2 * 12 and add those results. So it is
done in two lines. Let's say if we say
that this is one line this hole
and this is a specific solution and it
is correct. So there were minus
151 soldiers. But how that doesn't make
sense. It makes perfect sense because
this is one of the solutions and all
solutions are found using m= 60. So the
solutions are - 151
+ 60 - 91 + 60 - 31 + 60 it is 29
+ 60 is 89. father doesn't make sense
because there were actually 100 soldiers
and if most of them showed up at the
gathering at the assembly the correct
solution is 89. There were 89 soldiers
and in fact there are many applications
of the Chinese elemental theorem. The
last I will talk is the most common
used. So the first one calculating the
size of a set based on the remainders
from division by certain numbers we know
that we saw that twice. So for example
calculating how many soldiers there were
in order
we have a chocolate bar. We divided it
among five people and there were three
pieces left. Then we took some away and
tried dividing again because someone
else showed up for example. And among
six people there were five pieces left.
Then again someone came and among seven
people there were four pieces left. From
these three pieces of information we can
figure out how many pieces there are
pieces of chocolate. This makes sense
with large numbers like when we have a
forest perfectly arranged right and to
count the trees we can try to divide
them into three rows two columns five or
some groups and always having those
remainders sometimes positive sometimes
zero. Still given those reminders we can
determine how many trees there are in
the forest with a certain step like plus
80 + 80 and so on. But that is usually
sufficient in cryptography in RSA
encryption. The Chinese limited theorem
is used. You can see how the I added the
link. So you can see how the RSA
algorithm is implemented. In general,
one of the implementations or the most
common implementation is precisely the
Chinese remainder theorem. We can use
the Chinese remainder theorem for large
numerical calculations. Meaning when we
have a large number of additions,
subtractions, multiplications, possibly
divisions but but not by modulo numbers,
the calculations are enormous. For
example, on numbers with a million
digits. We can break these calculations
down to perform them modulo certain
prime numbers. We can invent 10 prime
numbers and perform all calculations
modulo these 10 prime numbers. This will
be for example three-digit result. So
everything is very simple. Then if you
want to get back the result as if we
calculated on huge numbers we just
multiply the results. This is a great
way to solve difficult problems when
where there are huge numbers. not
calculating on those huge numbers but on
smaller ones modulo prime numbers
because prime numbers are always
co-prime numbers and then we combine
results this is very often used also the
Chinese reminder theorem is related to
lranch interpolation and in proofs in
discrete mathematics and this is
probably the most commonly known
application for me many about natural
numbers especially about divisibility
ility by certain natural numbers can be
reduced to divisibility by a certain
prime numbers giving that natural number
in products because every natural number
is either prime or a product of prime
numbers and after combining the result
we solve the problem as if we divided by
that original theorem. I added links so
you can review lanch interpolation with
the Chinese.
It is uh here on on a blog on some guy
at art of problems solving.
I do not want to try to read this
nickname. Uh so uh this is connection
with Chinese theorem and interpolation.
And what example of a proof? For
example, proofs of quadratic
reciprocity. There is uh information
that there is one proof that uses double
counting. So we count something in one
way
and then we count it in different way
using Chinese theorem and if we computed
both both ways correctly then those sums
are equal and uh in that way it can be
proved that some formulas are equal. In
fact, we have seen it in our first
chapter I guess when we used inclusion
exclusion principle and some other way
using just a multiplication rule. We
have seen something similar with
steering numbers and s inclusion
exclusion principle that are always
equal for some problems and that way the
formulas can be given and this is
roughly how this type of proof is used.
So there are many applications of the
Chinese theorem and above all it is
interesting and okay that's that's what
I wanted to show in this course in the
next the last lesson I will tell you
what where you can go from here. See you
there.
Hello. I hope you want more. That
everything was interesting and that you
would like to gain even more knowledge
because there is more. There is more
than one person can ever acquire. This
should not be frightening but
fascinating. Let's talk about
applications of the knowledge gained in
this course and also where you can go
further. You can go into graph theory.
Actually, discrete mathematics courses
are often courses in graph theory. Here
are many topics like graph coloring,
minimum spanning trees, prim's algorithm
and crucal's algorithm. Many many more
spanning trees and tree searches are
also very close to programming. Many
discoveries in graph theory implicate to
solving programming problems. I have
worked with graph theory. It is very
interesting and I could basically record
a whole course on it. So you can request
that from me in the comments. Generating
functions are also very interesting.
Without going into what they are and
more what they are for, generating
functions allow us to solve recursive
formulas without using recursion. An
example is Fibonacci numbers. You can
also delve into interesting sets of
numbers like Catalan numbers. If you
feel you can't solve all combinatorial
problems at least up to university level
problems maybe because we have not yet
talked about Catalan numbers which also
count sizes of certain sets just like
bell numbers or stealing numbers.
Knowing Catalan numbers comes in handy.
The aantine equations that is equations
where we seek integer solutions. At the
end, we saw some examples of defanting
equations in connection with the Chinese
reminder theorem because A1, B1, A2, B2,
etc. were sought only in integers. If we
allowed non- integers, any A1, A2 would
have solutions, but we specifically
sought integer solutions and such
solving equations looking only for
integer or natural number solutions are
different equations. Many of equations
still do not have known solutions and we
do not know how to solve them. So it is
really an opportunity to solve them. It
is an open field for research. You can
go into probability theory including
cumulans or statistics that include for
example commumulants. Commons are
concepts that at the intersection of
statistics and probability theory which
often overlap just like combinatorics
does. Classic probability theory is
about counting favorable outcomes over
the total possibilities like we saw in
this course but you can move to full
probability theory reduced also with
continuous variables not just discrete
expressions. Integer programming or 01
linear programming is not related to
computer programming not so much. These
are mathematical topics where we look
for integer solutions in systems of
linear equations. 01 programming relates
more to decision v variables but you
need to study and read about it too.
Close to what we did in this course you
can read about certain kinds of prime
numbers. There is still the question
whether there are infinitely many twin
primes. There are mer primes, gmine
primes. There is also goldbach
conjecture or hypothesis which we
mentioned. So many topics involving
certain prime numbers exist. Hman coding
related to probability and binalities is
an example of looseless compression. If
you want to understand data compression
starting with Hoffman coding is a good
idea. Error collection code like basic
age codes codes is a whole field a whole
science. Graph neural networks generally
neural networks are pure discrete
mathematics. Someone might say linear
algebra more so linear algebra is also
part of discrete math at least some
parts dealing with integer solutions or
rational numbers which relates to
integer programming or theantine
equations. Information theory is also a
whole science. There are many such
sciences related to or part of discrete
mathematics. Game theory, theory of
computation, number theory, difference
and much much more. Now I haven't dealt
with all these topics because no one can
master everything. There is no person
who worked on all of them. Oiler worked
on many of these topics extensively. I
personally am closely related to number
theory, numerical methods, graph theory,
generating functions. I know Catalan
numbers too. Those are fields that I
understand and I could record a course
for that. So these are things I could
explain more from graph theory. As I
said, one could make a whole course
without exhausting the topic. So, I
encourage you to explore some topics
from all these fields and to like
mathematics because when you dive into
one of these fields, it's hard to get
out. You forget to eat or go to sleep.
It can be a little dangerous in quotes.
I truly encourage you to develop
yourself. See youa and thank you for
watching."

and OOTH 2 that make secure integrations
possible, setting the foundation for
your automation journey. You'll learn
the practical steps of setting up N and
then dive into four comprehensive
workflow examples, including an AI
powered chatbot and an emergency
WhatsApp notification system. Gavin will
guide you step by step through creating
these solutions, demonstrating how to
seamlessly integrate diverse services
like WhatsApp, Google Sheets, and AI
agents. Hi and welcome everyone. I'm
Gavin Lon. I'm a software developer with
decades of experience and I'm really
excited to bring you this video on N810.
We are going to dive into the exciting
world of workflow creation using the
N810 tool. So, what is NAT? Basically,
NAT is an open-source workflow
automation platform that lets you
connect different apps, APIs, and
services together in order to automate
tasks.
I've sometimes heard the process of
creating NA10 workflows referred to as
flowming. When creating the workflows
for this video, I found it interesting
how the thought process in implementing
some of the logic for the workflows was
practically the same when comparing it
to the process of implementing code in
programming. If conditions, loops,
separation of concerns, abstraction,
concepts with which most programmers are
familiar. But using NA10, you can create
some extremely powerful solutions
without implementing any code or with
minimal code. You are able to integrate
complex code into your workflows where
your requirement demands more fine grain
functionality. We'll take a brief look
at this towards the end of the video. In
this video, we'll create four workflow
examples using the NA10 tool step by
step in order to create real world
solutions that will not rely on the use
of code. When I first started working
with N810, I had this surge of creative
ideas erupt in my head, and I'm hoping
that by going through this video, it
will have the same effect on you.
I have to say, I think N810 is an
amazing tool. Although I must warn you,
my first reaction was.
[screaming]
But once that megalomaniacal energy
subsided in me, I started to think of
what in my opinion are some potentially
useful automation ideas. So the first
workflow example we'll create and
perhaps the least useful idea of all the
examples we'll look at in this video is
a chatbot powered by chat dbt that
provides the user with a list of ranked
items based on the user's prompt. So for
example you could ask the chatbot what
are the top five movies of all time and
it will answer you within seconds or
what are the largest mammals on earth
you know questions of that nature. So
perhaps more fun than useful, but I
think this example provides us with a
good introduction to N8 workflows and
how we can harness the power of AI in
our workflows. I later show you how you
can integrate WhatsApp into this
workflow so that you can interact with
your chatbot via WhatsApp. So you could
be out with your friends and someone
asks, ""Hey guys, what do you think are
the fastest five cars on Earth?"" With
access to your workflow through
WhatsApp, you can now eagerly whip out
your phone and be the WhatsApp
know-it-all guy and answer your friends
question immediately. In doing so,
really impress your friends. Everyone
loves the WhatsApp know-it-all guy.
[applause]
Perhaps it's not such a good idea to be
that guy. Right, moving on. The second
example is a bit more serious and
involves using WhatsApp to execute an
emergency request for assistance at your
physical address. I've called it the
WhatsApp panic app. So, for example, if
your home is being burglarized at 2:00
a.m., you can simply trigger a workflow
using WhatsApp from your phone, which
will then read relevant information like
your physical address from a Google
spreadsheet and send a notification
containing your address information to a
person on duty who can then dispatch
trained responders to your address to
handle the emergency situation. You can
probably tell from my accent that I'm
originally from South Africa. I've spent
a lot of time in the UK, but my
formative years were spent in South
Africa. Now, South Africa is a
wonderful, beautiful country with a
tremendous amount of potential. However,
it unfortunately suffers from extremely
high levels of crime. Those that can
afford it mostly have private security,
but those that can't afford private
security are actually the ones that are
most vulnerable to the high levels of
crime. Of course, many parts of the
world are affected by high crime levels.
So this is a workflow that could be
useful in many parts of the world. So
even though not everyone can afford
private security, I think most people
these days can afford a smartphone and
data. So I thought of a cheap solution
where those who can't afford private
security and perhaps live in informal
settlements can use WhatsApp for sending
emergency notifications. So if for
example a person's home is being
burglarized or the person feels under
threat for any reason, the person
affected can use WhatsApp by sending for
example the number one. It doesn't have
to be an actual message. Writing a
message is time consuming and this is an
emergency. So the number one is sent to
a designated community WhatsApp number
to request emergency responders to
attend the user's address to provide
assistance. So the panic message
triggers our workflow and a panic
notification is sent to a designated
person on duty who then dispatches a
response team to the address of the
person who sent the panic message. The
first part of this WhatsApp panic app is
a workflow that involves community
members registering over the internet to
use the WhatsApp panic app. So this
workflow is very simple. The user fills
in a form containing the user's WhatsApp
number and relevant details like full
name and address. Once the information
is submitted, the next step in the
workflow is invoked which saves the
users's information to a row in a
specific Google spreadsheet. The
WhatsApp number uniquely identifies the
user on the spreadsheet. The second
workflow in the WhatsApp panic
application is where the user sends the
number one to a specific WhatsApp number
that has been set up to receive panic
notifications. The first node in our
workflow is a WhatsApp trigger node. And
this node triggers the execution of the
workflow immediately after the user
sends the panic notification. The next
step in the workflow looks up the
registered user on the relevant Google
spreadsheet and identifies the user
through the user's WhatsApp number. The
user's address details are then read
from the spreadsheet and the panic
notification is sent to the person on
duty for the area in which the user
resides. The person on duty can then
dispatch responders to the user's
address in order to appropriately handle
the situation. The next idea I came up
with is a little bit more complex. So
this workflow automates the processing
of CVs or résumés of people applying for
a senior C developer position in a
software solution company. This workflow
involves the CVs or résumés being put
into a designated Google Drive folder.
The next step involves all of the file
names and unique IDs of those files
being read into a list. A loop step is
created so that each CV can be dealt
with individually. The significance of
including a loop in the workflow is that
this workflow involves the concept of a
human in the loop. So a CV being
processed in the loop is downloaded by
the next step and the subsequent step
reads the downloaded PDF files content
from binary into text format. The text
format is then fed into an AI agent
along with an appropriate prompt that
prompts the AI agent to summarize the
applicant's CV in a specific way. So the
summary of the CV is customized so as to
make the human in the loop part more
efficient. So the human in the loop can
at a glance judge whether the applicant
is suitable for the first round
interview or not. So the summary of the
CV is sent via email to the person in
charge of the interview process. This
person can then either approve the
application or decline the application
via two buttons that are present within
the relevant email. So the workflow at
this point pauses and won't resume until
the relevant person, the human in the
loop, either clicks the approve button
or the decline button. If the approve
button is clicked, the workflow resumes
processing and an AI agent is
subsequently used to schedule an
interview with the approved applicant on
the interviewer's Google calendar. If
the decline button is clicked, the
workflow resumes processing, but the AI
agent used for scheduling the interview
is bypassed when an applicant is
declined and then the next iteration in
the loop is executed. So the next CV is
then processed. So if there are eight
CVs in the relevant Google Drive folder,
then eight iterations of the loop will
be executed denoting eight CVs
appropriately being processed. So this
workflow automates the approval process
for a first round interview and each
applicant that is approved is scheduled
for the interview on the interviewer's
Google calendar. So once we've completed
the creation of these workflow examples
at the end of the video, I'll show you
some cool ideas in less detail
pertaining to what can be achieved in
your workflows. My hope is that this
video stimulates you to think of some
cool automation ideas for your own
workflows. It would be great if you
could share some of your ideas in the
comment section, but perhaps keep those
billiondoll ideas close to your chest.
>> World domination [cheering]
>> engineering is all about standards. The
NA10 tool relies on certain
internet-based standards for disparate
entities on the web to securely
communicate with one another and for the
disparit entities to work together in a
workflow. For example, N8N needs to
firstly have appropriate permissions to
for example send an email from within a
workflow via a Gmail account. So this
can be facilitated using the OOTH 2
standard through providing a valid
client ID and valid client secret. The
REST standard is widely used for
interacting with web APIs. REST
emphasizes simplicity, scalability, and
uniformity by using standard web
protocols and formats, often JSON or XML
for data exchange. Standards like REST
and OOTH 2 make engineering a lot more
efficient than if such standards didn't
exist. Without these standards,
engineers would potentially be
recreating similar protocols with each
new project in order to enable disparit
components to communicate with one
another. This is of course not very
practical or economical. If however
certain communication standards are
known universally, the engineer can
simply make use of the appropriate
standards like REST or OOTH 2 within the
relevant project when facilitating the
secure communication of one disparate
entity with another disparit entity. So
with these established standards like
REST or OOTH 2, one disparit entity like
for example a web API hosted in Japan
can securely communicate with another
entity for example a web API component
hosted somewhere in the United States.
So let's say these two entities were
engineered separately at different times
and independently from one another. Two
independent teams of developers that
have never met created these two web API
components that are now hosted with a
geographically vast distance between
them. Yet, one component or entity, if
you like, can communicate with the other
component and make use of that
component's services over the internet.
It's almost like magic. But universally
recognized established standards adhered
to by both independent teams are the
reason why this is possible. Standards
like these for example OOTH 2 and rest
are the underlying reason why a tool
like NAN can facilitate complex
functionality where the developer
doesn't need to know the complexities of
the underlying standards. This is
abstracted away and therefore the
developer can concentrate on the
business rules of the workflow that the
developer wishes to create. This allows
the developer to create sophisticated
workflows made up of independent
entities represented by nodes on a
canvas. These entities hosted
independently potentially vast distances
from one another can securely
communicate with one another using
established standards. So to create a
workflow the developer does not have to
worry about certain underlying
complexities. So basically N8 provides
an easy to use graphical user interface
where a developer can automate complex
tasks by simply connecting nodes
together in a specific sequence called a
workflow. So going back to the WhatsApp
panic app example, we have a WhatsApp
trigger node that is connected to a
Google Sheets node that is connected to
another Google Sheets node that is
lastly connected to a Gmail send a
message node. Each node represents a
step in the workflow. The workflow
represents the automation of a task. The
task is to dispatch responders to a
user's physical address following the
user sending a panic notification via
WhatsApp to a designated WhatsApp
number. The seamless integration of
diverse services like WhatsApp and
Google within a single workflow is made
possible by the interoperability
standards such as REST and OOTH 2. So
having at least a basic knowledge of how
REST and OOTH 2 work is definitely
beneficial. I created this video a few
years ago for my YouTube channel and it
may be helpful to you with your
understanding of OOTH 2. So, please
check out this video if you'd like to
see a basic explanation of how OOTH 2
works. The link is in the description of
this video. Right, let's get started.
Let's set up NAT so that it can be
hosted on Hostinger. So, in this video,
we are using Hostinger's self-hosting
model for our NAT workflows, which means
you host NAN yourself through the
provider, which makes the installation
of NA10 much easier. In short, we are
using the VPS virtual private server
hosting option for NA10 self-hosting
model with a preconfigured NA10
template. I'll briefly guide you through
the sign up and installation of NA10 on
Hostinger. So, you can host your NA10
workflows on Hostinger. You'll see it's
very straightforward and easy to do.
Once we are set up to use NAT hosted on
Hostinger, we'll build four workflows
together step by step. So let's start by
navigating to this URL.
Then choose your plan.
Configure your payment period for
example for 1 month, 12 months or 24
months.
Configure your hosting options like
geographic location and operating
system. Login and provide your billing
details.
I unchecked moreware scanner at this
stage and clicked the finish setup
button.
Then it takes about 5 minutes to install
and set up NA10 on Hostinger and you are
able to leave at this point and you can
be notified via email when NAT is set up
appropriately.
Then you can click the manage VPS button
like this.
I skipped this bit.
Then on the same line or row of the NA10
label here, click the manage app button
like this.
Then set up your owner account and
choose an appropriate password
that you will need when you log on to
use NAN in the future. Then you can
customize NAN.
Great. And now you are ready to create
an NAT workflow.
As you'll see at this point, my Chrome
browser is using a light theme, but I
subsequently chose a dark theme for
Chrome before I created our first
workflow.
Please note, you have access to many N8N
templates, and you can check those out
by clicking this templates menu option
here.
It's great. So, let's get into it. Let's
create our first workflow.
Okay. So, let's create our first
example.
Um, what we're going to do here is we
are going to create a folder to house
our examples. You can see I've got loads
of workflows I've been creating in
preparation for this course. So let's
start by organizing all our new
workflows into our own folder. And you
can do that using this facility here. So
click this arrow down icon here and then
create folder. And I'm just going to
call this my workflows.
Like that. Okay. Create. We've got a my
workflows folder. Let's go into that
folder. Nothing in my workflows yet. So,
let's create something. And we can do
that by hitting this create workflow
button here. So, let's do that. Let's
hit the create workflow button. And
we're presented with the canvas here.
And we're going to create our first
example, which is just a chatbot, which
when we prompt the LLM that we're going
to use in our chatbot, it returns an
output of a list of items that we
request. for example, a list of ranked
national rugby teams, the top five best
national rugby teams or the top five
best movies of all time. So that's what
this chatbot's going to be all about. So
it's a very simple example to get us
going, just to get us started. And to
start this workflow, usually what we
first do is we click this plus icon and
we add a trigger. So each workflow has
to start with a trigger. For example,
you could trigger it manually just by
clicking the node and then it would
trigger your workflow or an a web hook
call. So you could uh kick off this
workflow from an external source using
HTTP. You could call the relevant URL
for a web hook that we create within our
NAT workflow and it would kick off the
workflow and we could pass various
parameters to our workflow and that sort
of thing. And then an onsubmission form
where we we'll actually look at this in
a in a a little bit later. And you can
create for example a registration form
where the user enters loads of
information about the user and presses a
submit button and then that information
can get captured on a Google spreadsheet
or a database table or whatever. So each
workflow must start off with a trigger.
And the trigger that I'm going to use
here is the on chat message. But we can
actually add this by default by just
adding an AI agent node. The AI agent
node enables us to create this chatbot
functionality that we're going to create
here. So I'm going to do a search for
the AI agent node. And let's click on
this option here. And you can see here
we're presented with a really great user
interface. And it provides you with a
really good UX user experience because
you've got the incoming data. It's very
intuitive. You got the incoming data,
you've got the actual node itself which
processes the incoming data. And then
you've got the output which will uh be
presented us when you click for example
the execute step button here. But if we
press an execute step button here now,
for example, nothing's going to happen
because you can see here that this
prompt or user message field is grayed
out because we haven't yet generated any
user input. So that will be the first
thing that we do. So let's actually go
back to the canvas here. And now this is
what I wanted to show you. We've got our
trigger node that has already been added
by default. It's connected to the left
hand side of our AI agent here. So you
can see that it's very intuitive. You
can see the flow in action just by
looking at the canvas here. When chat
message received, so we create the chat
message which becomes our prompt for the
AI agent. That input is connected here.
So the input flows in the direction to
the right to the AI agent. And you can
see here it's trying to by default
capture JSON.p input in this JavaScript
expression here. You can tell that this
is a JavaScript expression because it's
wrapped in double curly braces here. And
we got dollar json.put, but we don't
have any input. It says no input data
yet, which means we haven't got any data
to work with at the moment. So, if we
press execute step, it's not going to do
anything. That's actually gone red
because nothing has happened. There's no
input data. It's grayed out here. So,
that's the first thing we're going to
do. We're going to generate some input.
And by default, we've actually got this
facility that we can work with here to
add our prompt to the web that will get
captured by the web by the when chat
message received trigger node. So I'm
going to prompt or I'm going to enter
some input which is basically the prompt
for the AI agent. What are the best
sorry what are the top top five best
national
rugby
teams
and let's see what happens. Okay, chat
model sub node must be connected and
enabled. You see we've got this
connector here and it's labeled chat
model. And when we press it, you see
this panel shoots out from the right of
our screens here because we can now
actually add a chat model to our agent.
This agent basically doesn't have a
brain at the moment. It's just a node
and it won't do anything. But one thing
that we do have here, if we go in there,
we've actually got some data to work
with. Now you can see the JSON.put input
expression is now green, which means
it's picking up what we've entered into
our chat input field here. So, we could
actually execute a step, but it still
won't work. Chat model subnode must be
connected and enabled. So, let's go back
to the canvas. Let's click the chat
model. So, you can see it's labeled chat
model and it's got a red star there,
meaning it's required for our AI agent
to um perform or to function. We do need
that.
We do need to attach a model, a relevant
LLM. So, let's press that plus icon
here. And then the panel shoots out from
the right of our screens. And you could
add an anthropic chat chat model, Azure
OpenAI chat model, AWS Bedrock chat
model, whatever chat model you want,
Deep Seek chat model,
Google Gemini chat model. But we want to
add, we're going to add the open AI chat
model. So we can actually perform a
search for it. Open AI chat model. And
we can just attach that model to the AI
agent. And you can see here on the
canvas, it's attached that subnode AI
open AI chat model to our AI agent. So
we are giving it a brain here. So now
let's go into our open AI chat model
here. And you can see I've actually
created credentials here. I've created a
few of them here already. So that's why
it's picking everything up. It's picked
up GPT4.1
mini, which is the which is the LLM that
I want. You can see we've got a wide
selection of LLMs we can choose from,
but I want to select GPT 4.1 mini
because that suits our purposes here.
Um, so let's go back to the canvas here.
Let's go into AI agent. And we now have
a brain for our um for our AI agent. But
let's go into our open AI chat model.
And you can see here I've got
credentials set up already, which means
I can connect to the relevant LLM, the
relevant chat model um from made
available to us through Open AI.
But if you haven't set up any
credentials to access this third-party
functionality provided by OpenAI, you
will need to create credentials. And
this is how you do it. So let's go
through the process of how you would add
credentials to this particular open AAI
chat model here. This chat model node,
you would go to the credential to
connect with field here. You click the
dropown and click create new credential
like that. And you can see how we've got
API key. It's got a red star next to it,
which means it's a required field. And
so we need to insert a valid API key
here in order to use the relevant LLM,
the GPT mini, the GPT4 mini LLM that we
want to use in our agent node, in our AI
agent node. So
let's go to OpenAI. So let's go to
Google here and just type in Open AI.
And we're going to set up a credential
for OpenAI. And it's this one that we
want here.
Um, we want OpenAI.com here. So, let's
click that. And then it's defaulted us
to ChatgPT. So, we could use ChatgPT for
free here, but that's not what we want
in this particular case. We need to go
to this login button here. And we want
to go to the AI platform.
Okay. and I've been already logged on
because I've created an account. If you
haven't yet created an account, you need
to create an account with OpenAI.
So, when you sign up, it will ask you to
spend a minimum of $5 and that will give
you $5 worth of credits that you can use
to interact with Open AI. So, you can't
really get around that. There used to be
a free tier. There's not a free tier
available at the moment. each call to
open AAI diminishes your credits by tiny
amount. So it does give you a lot of
available functionality.
Um and then the next step is we go to
this dashboard header option here
and we create our API key by clicking
firstly clicking this API keys option
here. Great. And you can see I've
already created three
API keys. So let's create another one.
This is how you do it. You go create new
secret key like that. And then let's
name it. So my API
key. I'm just going to say N here. And
then you press the create secret key
button here and it generates your key.
And then you won't if you go out of this
dialogue, you won't see this um API key
again. So, what you want to do is copy
it to your clipboard. Then go back to NA
in here and then paste it in here. And
then you click the save button. Okay.
And you can see here it's been
successful. So, we can now successfully
interact with Open AI through our OpenAI
chat model here, which is GPT 4.1 Mini.
Excellent. So, we can go back to the
canvas here. Let's go to our AI agent.
And we can now actually execute this
step because we've inputed our prompt
here and it's remembered our prompt and
it's available to us through this JSON
data here. And you can see this field
chat input which has been added here by
default JSON.put.
So it's picking that value up there. And
we can actually that will go through now
to our GPT 4.1 mini model because we've
set it up to do so in our canvas here.
We've added the open AI chat model to
our AI agent here. And so now we can
actually execute this step here. And you
can execute it from here just for for a
test. And our prompt is what are the top
five best national rugby teams? And
let's hit the execute step button here
and see what we get.
Okay. Human, what are the top five best
national rugby teams? And the output as
of the most recent rankings and general
performance in international rugby, the
top five national rugby teams are often
considered to be New Zealand rugby. And
you can see here it's got a lot of blurb
surrounding the actual list. And we
actually just want the list. We don't
want all this fluffy blurb coming from
the prompt. We just want the list. So
how can we specify that we just want the
list and we don't want all the
surrounding blurbs? So we just want
return from this prompt New Zealand,
South Africa, England, Ireland, France,
not all this other blurb. So to do that,
we can add a system prompt. You'll
notice how we have a panel in the center
of our screens where we can customize
settings and parameters for our target
node, which in this case is the AI agent
node. So for example, we can configure
this field marked prompt user message to
prompt our AI agent. We can toggle this
switch here marked required specific
output format to the on position which
means we can specify a specific output
format for our AI agent instead of the
output provided by default which would
simply be the response outputed by
whichever AI model we choose as the
brain as it were for our AI agent.
Importantly, we have this execute step
button here on the top right, which
allows us to execute our node or this
step in the workflow at this point. By
clicking this execute step button, we've
actually executed our basic
functionality here. But what our problem
is here is that it's outputting the
output format that we've got here is too
fluffy. There's too much fluff there. We
want to trim it down to just the list
items, just the names of the rugby
teams. So to do that we can actually
augment the prompt by adding a system
prompt or a system message. So let's
discuss the difference between the user
prompt and the system prompt. So the
user prompt can be described as the
input or question the end user provides
to the LLM. So our question here is
which are the top five best national
rugby teams. The purpose of the user
prompt is to directly tell the model
what the user wants. Whether that's a
question, instruction, or request. So
here we are asking the model to rank the
world's national rugby teams and give us
the top five world national rugby teams.
A system prompt provides hidden
instructions to the LLM by the system or
developer before the user interacts with
it. The purpose of the system prompt is
to set the model's behavior,
personality, style, rules, and
boundaries. So, how can we add a system
prompt so that we can make the output
from our language model more concise?
So, it just lists the national teams and
doesn't waste tokens. Remember, each
token comes at a cost. So, we want to be
more economical with our tokens. We can
add a system prompt by clicking the add
option button here. Going to system
message and then we have this input box
here that we can utilize in order to add
our system prompt. So I just want to
enlarge that a little bit so you can see
it on the screen. Okay. So we can
actually format this in markdown which
makes it a lot easier for us to read us
as the developer to read. So let's add a
header with in markdown format. So, hash
roll. So, we're going to add a RO header
here. We're basically going to tell the
um AI agent what its role is. We're
going to define its role. So let's type
you are a helpful
assistant
that provides
consise
ranking lists
to the user
in response
to user questions. So that is its role
and we're defining it here within the
system message. This is the system
prompt. Okay, let's press the enter key.
And the next thing I want to do is
provide
our AI agent with instructions. So let's
create an instructions section in
markdown. So we type hash
instructionctions
like that. Press the enter key. And now
we can define our instructions. So each
item
in the ranking list should be on a new
line. So this is how we want our output
to be formatted. A list item
must only include
the name of the item
and not any additional
in
information. Great. And that's just a
basic instruction to our
LLM on how to format the output. And the
other thing we can do is actually
provide the LLM with examples of the
format. So let's create an example
section. So hash
whoops examples like that. And then we
can
provide examples to our LLM like this.
So a ranked list of top five best
best national
rugby teams would look like this. Comma
and then we can just include a list of
our rugby teams. So New Zealand,
South Africa,
England,
France and Ireland.
Great. And let's provide another
example. So a ranked list of top five
best movies of all time would look like
this. Comma. And then we can include
movie examples. Shaw
Shank Redemption. Certainly one of my
favorite movies of all time.
Like that. And then the Godfather
12 angry men.
Okay. The dark
knight and the god father
part two. So we're just basically
providing examples of how we would like
the output presented to us.
Okay. And I think that looks pretty
good.
So, let's save our workflow. Control S
if you're on a Mac. Command S, should I
say, if you're on a Mac, control S if
you're on a Windows platform. And then
we can just execute that step again and
see what our output looks like. Okay.
So, we got the input and the output. New
Zealand, South Africa, England, France,
Ireland. And it's outputting our data in
the format that we provided in our
examples. So in prompt engineering, a
oneshot example or oneshot prompt means
that you give the model one example of
the desired behavior, format or
reasoning pattern within the prompt
itself before asking it to perform the
same kind of task on the new input. It's
a middle ground between
zero shot prompting and this is when you
give no examples. You just ask the
question or give an instruction and then
you have few shot prompting. You give
several examples to help the model
generalize the pattern. We are giving
our prompt two examples but we could of
course provide more examples regarding
the type of response we want as output.
And you can see it's very intuitive how
it flows. So the input from the chat
trigger the facility provided to us
through N8 goes flows to the AI agent
and then that goes to the subnode the AI
the LLM. So it goes off to um to open AI
and we've set up the credentials. So
that's how we are able to interact with
OpenAI and then OpenAI returns the
response through our AI agent and the
response has been formatted
appropriately
the way that we've asked it to format
our output. And we can look at this in
JSON format here. Great. And that's
working correctly. That's working as
expected. But now let's go back to the
canvas.
And there's something I want to show you
that's very important. So, we've got a
chatbot kind of working here, but it's
not perfect because at the moment, if we
had a conversation with our chatbot,
it's only going to remember one prompt.
And you'll see what I mean by this. So,
subsequent prompts will not have any
context. So, it will see that as an
individual prompt, any subsequent
prompts. So, we need to do something
here that's very important. And I'll
just demonstrate why that is now. So,
let's go. What are the top five best
movies of Whoops. Movies of all time
like this. And let's see what response
we get. Short Shank Redemption, The
Godfather, The Dark Knight, 12 Angry
Men, Shindless List. Okay, that's great.
But now what if we said what are the
next
best five? Let's see what it does.
Okay, so it doesn't have a clue what we
mean by that. Could you please specify
the category or context for the next
best five? For example, are you
referring to movies, books, sports
teams, or something else? And the reason
it's sending back this response is
because it can't remember the previous
response. So it has no context
whatsoever. So we can actually give our
AI agent memory which will allow us to
give it context. So we can actually so
the user will actually be able to have a
conversation with the chatbot. So it's
pointless having a chatbot that you
can't really converse with. So um to add
memory from NAN, you'd simply press the
plus icon button here where it's labeled
memory. You can see memory u below the
AI agent. You've got chat model. So
we've added a chat model, open AI chat
model. We can add memory and we can add
tools. And we'll look at adding tools
later on. Now the difference between a
chatbot which is what we're creating
here and an actual agent is that an
agent actually does something for
example schedule an interview and add it
to the user's calendar. Whereas this
provides us with a chatbot that we can
converse with. So we can prompt it we
question and it will answer our question
for example but it won't actually do
anything. So this is just a chatbot, but
we want to add memory to our chatbot so
that we can have a conversation with our
chatbot and it will remember the
previous prompt. So let's do that by
pressing the plus icon here attached to
the memory connector here. And you can
see the panel shoots out from the right
of our screens here. And we can now add
our memory. And we have various options
here. But they are separated into for
beginners and other memories. We only
want to add simple memory. So let's
select simple memory here. Great.
Okay. And this context window here, this
is important, is set to five. Context
window length is set to five. And that
suits our needs because we don't need
more than that for what we want here.
But you could, for example, set it to
10. And then it would remember the last
10 prompts, the last 10 kind of uh
interactions with the with the uh AI
agent. But five will do for our purposes
here. So it will remember the last five
interactions. And that's what this means
here. And this session ID field just
provides a constant thread of
conversation. If the session ID was
different each time you prompt it, it
wouldn't have that memory. So it's one
thread of conversation. That's what this
unique session ID represents here. So
this is a unique ID. So that regarding a
particular conversation with the
chatbot. Okay. So let's go back to the
canvas here and we can actually test
that again. So let's go back to the
rugby example. So what are the best five
national
rugby
teams like that?
Okay. New Zealand, South Africa,
England, France, Ireland. Excellent.
That's what I would have expected to
see. And then now what if we go
and what
are the next best five? So we haven't
included any context in this prompt. It
doesn't know that we're talking about
rugby teams. But because we've added
memory, it will remember the last
interaction where we did mention rugby
teams. So that provides this prompt with
its context. So, it will remember that.
Hopefully, it will remember that we're
talking about national rugby teams here.
And let's see if it does.
Excellent. Australia, Wales, Argentina,
Scotland, Japan, and that makes sense.
So, we've now got the top 10 best
national rugby teams. So, that's great.
And we could say, for example, ask what
are the best authors of all time?
And we've got a functional chatbot here
that helps us rank various items.
William Shakespeare, Leo Toltoy, Charles
Dickens, Jane Austin,
JRR Tolken. Okay, that makes sense.
Great. And the next five.
And let's see what response we get. So,
we got the next five best authors.
Excellent.
So, we've got done our first uh workflow
and everything seems to be working
correctly and we've created a very basic
chatbot.
Let's go into um Hostinger.
Okay, I'm just going to go to my account
here
and log in to Hostinger.
Log in with my credentials, my Google
credentials.
Okay.
And then we go to manage here and skip
this. And then manage app. And then
we're going to log to NAT.
Okay.
Email address. So I'm logging in with my
credentials.
Okay. Okay. Okay, and we're logged in
now. So, let's go into personal. And I
created a folder called my workflows
here. And first thing I'm going to do is
actually just go in here and name the
project that we created in the previous
segment of this course. And I'm going to
name this example one.
Example one dash chatbot. Like that.
Let's go back to my workflows. And
within my workflows, I'm going to create
another workflow for this example. And
let's name this one
uh panic
app
registration
like this.
Okay. And we're going to get started in
a bit. But the first thing we want to do
is to create
a Google sheet. So, I'm going to use my
Safari browser to log into Google with
my credentials. So, if you don't have a
Google account, you will need to create
a free Google account and then log in.
And then I'm going to go to sheets here
and I'm going to create a new Google
sheet. So, I'm just going to create hit
this option here, blank spreadsheet.
Okay, great. And I'm going to name this
panic app registration
like that.
So let's include headings for the
various fields. This denotes the
information that the user will enter
into a submission form to register to
use the panic app. So we want first name
for the first field
and in the second column we want last
name like that and then we want email in
this field here and then address one
address one and address two. So only two
fields regarding the address because I'm
basing this on an example for an
informal settlement. So these are people
who can't necessarily afford private
security. They live in an informal
settlement. So their address will be for
example the house number will be address
one and the area in which they live will
be block B or block C. So you can
extrapolate this example out to a like
that would have a postcode and then you
might have more address fields. But for
this we're talking about informal
settlements where they might not
necessarily have a postcode. So address
one will have a house number 13. And
address two could be for example block D
or block B. And then for the last field,
it's going to be what uniquely
identifies the person who's registering
for the app. And that will be the
users's WhatsApp number. So each user
will have a unique WhatsApp number. And
we're going to use that to uniquely
identify each registered user. Okay. And
that's pretty much our spreadsheet. So,
we want to go back to N8N. And I've got
that loaded up in Chrome. So, I'm going
to minimize this here.
And I'm going to go to Chrome now.
And the first step is to click this plus
icon here in the middle of our canvas to
add a trigger node to our workflow. So,
each workflow starts with a trigger
node, which is what we discussed in the
when we were creating the first workflow
in this course. So, let's hit the plus
icon here.
And of course, the panel or the window
shoots out from the right side of our
screen. And we can add whatever trigger
we want. You can see here trigger
manually, which means you trigger a
workflow by clicking on the trigger
manually node. But we are actually going
to trigger our workflow with the node
marked on form submission. So, we're
going to select on form submission and
we're going to build a form.
Okay. So let's give our form a title.
And you can see here form title. So
let's go into this form title field. And
we are going to give this a title of
register.
Okay. Make that a bit larger. Register
user
for security
response like this.
Okay. And then we can give our form a
description. So, registered
users can request
armed response.
Sorry. Respon response
in e
Gen C's
via WhatsApp.
Okay, great. So now we want to create
our form elements. So these are the
fields that we are going to map to the
fields that we created within our Google
sheet. So let's go to Google Sheets here
quickly. And you can see here we got
first name, last name, email, address
one, address two, WhatsApp number. So we
are going to now create those fields
within our NA10 work workflow
specifically our on form submission node
here this particular step for this
particular step. So we go add form
element here and the field name is first
name.
Okay. And we're just going to leave that
as text. And the placeholder that will
appear within the relevant text box will
just be first name like that. And all of
these fields are going to be required.
So the user must enter the user's first
name and all the other fields. So we're
just going to put we're going to switch
this to on the on position required
field. Like that means it will have a
red star next to the field. And you'll
see that when we eventually run the form
and then we want to add a new field. And
this one we're going to call last name.
And we're going to leave that as text.
And the placeholder will be last name.
And we also want to switch this required
field into the on position because each
of these fields as I've said are
required fields. And then we want to
include a field called email.
And let's select email here. So what the
user enters will automatically be
validated. So if the the user enters an
erroneous an erroneously formatted email
address, it won't let the user submit
the relevant form until that particular
email information has been entered
correctly in the correct format. And
we'll just in the placeholder field,
we'll just include email address like
this. And let's switch the required
field field on like this. Okay, so the
user must enter a valid email address
and the next one will be address one. So
this could be for example the person's
house number and we'll leave that as
text. So we'll just call this address
one like that and switch required field
on. And then we've got the address to
field that we must include here address
two and let's leave that as text and
placeholder address two. So this will be
the name of the area in the informal
settlement in which the user lives. For
example, block A, block B, block C.
Okay. And then let's switch this to on.
And
great. And then the last one is the
WhatsApp number, the user's WhatsApp
number. Okay. So
WhatsApp
number like that. And we'll leave that
as text. And the placeholder
Okay, we leave that as text and the
placeholder is simply WhatsApp
number. And let's switch that to the on
position.
So even though this step is not actually
connected to anything, this trigger
node, we've only got one node at the
moment here, the on form submission
node. We want to create some information
that we can use. So I'm actually going
to do that now by running the first
node, the on form submission node. So
let's double click on that node. And we
can include and we can execute the step
by pressing this button, execute step.
And you can see now our form has been
created for us already. Look at that.
That's pretty great. So register user
for security response. Registered users
can request armed response in
emergencies via WhatsApp. And I'm going
to include my first name here, lawn.
Email. So include your email address.
And
okay, let's say that I live at
house number 12,
block B.
And I'm going to actually
include my actual WhatsApp number here
so I can actually test um a user
panicking via WhatsApp. So we can see
the whole application in action and how
it would actually work via WhatsApp. So
this is actually my valid WhatsApp
number. And I would urge you to do the
same thing. Actually include a valid
WhatsApp number that you can test the
work the next workflow with where where
a user actually panics using the
WhatsApp application. So a panic
notification actually goes through
through through the use of WhatsApp. So
we must include a valid WhatsApp number
and this WhatsApp number is used to
uniquely identify a registered user a
user who's registered to use the
WhatsApp panic app. Okay. So,
great. And of course, this isn't going
to go anywhere, but it will capture this
information. We'll be able to pin this
information so that we can run the next
step in isolation, i.e. without having
to fill this form in every time we want
to test our workflow. So, I'm just going
to hit the submit button. Great. So, it
says here, form submitted. Your response
has been recorded. Excellent. So, let's
go out of that there. And if we go into
the node, we can see our output here.
And that looks great. That looks
perfect. So, the output is valid here.
The information that I've entered there.
And a great thing that we can do here
now so that we don't have to keep going
through that submission process in order
to test the subsequent nodes in our
workflow or the subsequent steps in our
workflow is we can pin this data. And
well to pin the data all we need to do
is press this pin icon here. So let's
pin that data by pressing this pin icon
here.
Excellent. So that's excellent. Great.
Okay. And we can go back and continue
building our workflow. Now, now that
we've got our submission form trigger,
our on form submission trigger set up
correctly. And to do that, we can
connect another node, and this will be
the Google sheet node to the on form
submission. So, the next step in this
workflow is to add that information,
this information here that we've pinned
to our spreadsheet. Okay. Okay. So,
let's go back to canvas and let's click
this plus button to connect the Google
sheet sheets node. The Google Sheets
node. So, let's click this option here.
And then we've got various options to
choose from. And we want to append a row
to our Google sheet. So, we want this
option here. Append row and sheet.
Great. And it's added that there. And
you can see I've actually set up
relevant credentials here to connect to
my Google sheet that we created earlier
on. But I want to go through the process
of how you will create those
credentials. So we'll create new
credentials for this step here. And you
can see here on the input we've got our
pinned data that will be sent through to
the node here, the append row to Google
sheet node here. append row and sheet
node here and then this node will be
responsible for adding that information
to our Google sheet. So it will add the
relevant field values under the
counterpart headings here in our Google
sheet. Okay. So let's go through the
process of creating a credential so that
N8N has permissions to add a row to a
Google sheet that is saved under your
account credentials in Google. So this
is basically a way for us to give N8
permission, this workflow permission to
add a row to a Google sheet. That's
basically all we're doing here. So let's
click create new credential.
And you can see here it's using the OOTH
2 the OOTH 2 standard by default so that
we can give permissions to N8 to access
that Google sheet and what it requires
are two fields client ID and client
secret. So we need to generate those
values and we do that through Google. So
to set up our credential we actually
need to go to a specific Google path.
So, we need to look up console
Google Cloud. And this is what we want
here. We want this URL,
console.cloud.google.com.
And we go, we just click this URL link
here.
And you can see I'm already logged in.
If you're not logged on, we uh you must
log on. And this actually just reflects
your latest project, your current
project. Okay. Okay. So, we want to
create a new project here.
So,
so this is the the current project I've
got loaded. But if you click this button
here, it will present you with this
dialogue and then you can create a new
project. So, by clicking this option
here, new project.
Okay. And
great. So now we can give our project a
name. Call this project N8N
panic app
project like this. Great. Okay. I'm just
going to say no organization here and
let's just create our project. So click
the create button like this. So it's
creating new project and now we have to
select our new project NA10 panic app
project. So I click the select project
link here.
Okay. And so now NA10 panic app project
is our current project. Okay. So in the
left menu here,
let's go to API and services library
like this.
Excellent.
And then we want to enable a particular
API and that would be the Google Sheets
API because actually what we're doing
here is engaging with the Google Sheets
API and instructing the Google Sheets
API to add the relevant fields that
we've discussed that we've created in
N810 to the relevant spreadsheet here.
Okay. So let's search for the
appropriate API. So we search for Google
Sheets
API and there it is. Great. And let's
select that option. So it's presented
Google Sheets API in a result here. So
let's select that there.
And then we click the enable button.
Here we're enabling Google the Google
Sheets API for this particular project
that we're going to be connecting to
through NA10. So let's click the enable
button.
Excellent. And now we want to generate
our client ID and our client secret. So
to do that we go to credentials here.
Okay. Okay. So from this web page we
need to click create credentials like
this and then OOTH client ID. So let's
select this option. Oorthth client ID.
Okay. Brilliant. A client ID is used to
identify a single app to Google's
Oorthth server. So now we click the
configure consent screen button. Okay.
And let's get started.
Okay. So let's give it an app name.
Uh let's just call this panic app
or panic WhatsApp.
Panic app WhatsApp. Whatever. Okay.
Supported email. And that's just going
to be my email address here. So just
pick the default address there. And then
click the next button. And this will be
external. We want to select the for
audience. It's going to be an external
audience. So select external there.
Click the next button.
And then contact information. So
okay, just se just give your email
address.
Okay.
Just put in whichever contact email
addresses you want to include for
contact information. Click next and then
I agree to the Google API services user
data policy and then press continue and
then create.
Okay. So, we're basically creating a
consent screen and you'll see the
consent screen when we log into Google
via NAN once we've included the client
ID and the client secret.
And now we go create
OOTH client. We hit this create OOTH
client button here.
Okay. Okay. And the application type is
web application.
Name web client one. I'm actually just
going to leave that as is at the
default.
And then we need to paste from N8
the callback URI that's given to us
here. So click click to copy here.
There. So we've copied that to our
clipboard. Let's go back to Safari
in my case where I'm filling in this
form and paste that in there. And that's
the callback URI.
Okay. And then let's press create.
And it's generated our client ID and our
client secret. So we can now just copy.
Let's copy first the client ID value.
Let's go to N8N here and paste that in
the client ID field. And then let's do
the same for the client secret here.
Let's paste that in there. And then we
can simply and let's just go okay
because we've copied the relevant
fields. And it's created our client ID
and our client secret. So let's save
that information. The client ID and
secret credential successfully created
inside your personal space. Brilliant.
And now we actually need to provide
consent for N8N to connect to Google and
be able to use that Google sheet. So
we've provided all the necessary
credentials, the client ID and the
secret. And now we just need to provide
consent. So let's go sign in with
Google. And this is just how the OOTH 2
protocol works. Okay, I'm going to sign
in with my credentials here.
One thing we need to actually do before
we provide consent so that NAT can add
the relevant fields to our Google sheet.
So NA10 can have the appropriate
privileges to access our Google sheet is
we need to add a test user. So I'm going
to go to the audience option here and
I'm going to add a test user here. So
add I'm just going to add myself.
So add your email address of the account
that you've logged on as. Okay. And I'm
going to save that there.
Okay. So I've added a test user. And now
I'm going to sign in with Google and
provide consent. Okay. So go to I'm
going to log in with my credentials into
Google.
Continue.
Okay. And now we are presented with the
relevant consent screen that we've just
built uh within our project that we just
created within uh console cloud Google
and we're going to provide consent. So
we're going to select all here. Click
the continue button to provide consent.
Connection successful. Excellent. So now
we can use our Google Sheets account
three. And it's account three because
I've created uh several other accounts
prior to this. So that's the reason why
it's got this three appended to it. So
we're now successfully connected and
we've given consent for NA10 for our
workflow to access our Google sheet. And
we can actually just execute this step
from here because we've got this pinned
data. So we won't have to re-enter all
those values for those for the relevant
fields. We can just execute this node
right here, this step right here. But we
actually can't because we haven't wired
up the relevant fields, the field values
here to our document and we haven't
selected the document that we want to
connect this step to. So that's the next
step. So we got from list here. I'm
actually we actually going to use the
ID. So with the document field here, we
want to select by ID here and then we
want to enter the ID. So, we must go
back to the
spreadsheet here. And I'm going to
copy the ID. This is the actual ID of
the Google sheet. It's part of the
actual URL. So, so this value here,
just copy it to your clipboard.
So, control C. I'm on a Mac, so it's
control C obviously uh sorry, command C
if you're on a Mac. and Ctrl C if you're
on um a Windows PC. So, I'm going to
copy that ID to my clipboard and then go
back to N8 and paste that ID here.
So, now we can actually test whether
we've been successfully connected to
that Google
spreadsheet by pressing this down arrow
in this drop-own list here for the sheet
field. So, we want to select the
relevant sheet that we want to access
within our Google document. And we can
do that by pressing here, this arrow
down button here.
It hasn't connected because I've
included too much information here. If
we look here, it's got parts of the URL
that we don't need. So, I'm going to
remove remove those parts here.
And we just want the ID here. And now it
should connect. And let's see if it
does. And there we go. Sheet one from
list.
Okay. Excellent. And automatically it's
taken it's read those fields that we
created. So these field from these field
headers here it knows that these are the
fields that we want to wire up. So it's
automatically detected those fields and
presented them to us here. And to wire
them up to our data, we can now drag and
drop. You see, we've got JSON data
presented to us in the input section
here. And we can wire up those fields to
the fields
that we've included within our Google
spreadsheet. And to do that, all you do
is you drag and drop the field from the
input section to its counterpart field
within the
append row in sheet node here. And you
can see it's gone green because it's
valid a valid JavaScript expression. So
it's picked up that field value. And you
can see this expression means that it's
dynamic. You see we've got the
expression option here selected. We
could have the fixed option here select
but we want the expression option
because this must be dynamic. It's like
a variable. So for each run of our
workflow, of course this value can vary.
So you might for example register Bob
Jones for the next uh execution of the
workflow. Um so the first name Gavin
here will of course be different. It
will be Bob in this particular case if
we're registering Bob Jones. So let's go
through this. So then we can wire up the
last name field and it's the same
process and wire up email like this.
Okay. And then we can just wire up
address one like this.
address two
and then WhatsApp number like that.
Great. And we've wired up our fields.
And actually, we're ready to test this
step, the append row to sheet, append
row in sheet step. And because we've
pinned our data, we don't have to
actually fill in the form again. And we
can just execute this step. And it
should place these field values under
their counterpart field headings here.
And let's see if that works. So let's
execute step.
Excellent. That looks good. Node
executed successfully. And let's go back
to our spreadsheet. And there it is.
There are our values that have been
successfully added to the spreadsheet.
Okay, great. So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to unpin this data from the
the previous um node from the on form
submission node. I'm going to unpin that
data and we'll run through the entire
workflow in production. So you can see
here we we would access this URL for
test purposes, but if we were running
our workflow in production, we would use
this production URL here. So let's copy
this to our clipboards. production URL
here. Let's go back to our canvas uh now
and let's save this and let's select
this switch here so that our workflow is
active. Let's select this option here.
So let's press this here to the on
position.
Got it. And now it's activated
and we can actually run this in
production from
the production URL. So, let's go. Let's
open another tab here. Paste that
production URL in there. And now, let's
register Bob Jones. Oops. Bob
Jones.
Bob
Jones at Hotmail. This isn't a valid
address, though. It might be a valid
address, so don't use it. Um, it's just
a test address as far as I'm concerned.
And then his number is 12. No, we've
done 12. So 10 and he lives in block
A and his WhatsApp number is pretty much
anything. This is not a valid WhatsApp
number. And we can submit that form
submitted and we can check whether that
information has been added appropriately
to our spreadsheet and it has.
Excellent.
So our workflow is now operational.
Okay. So let's create a new workflow and
let's call our workflow WhatsApp panic
app. In fact, let's call it panic app
notification. You can see we've got
panic app registration that we created
in the previous section of this course
where a user registers to use the
WhatsApp panic app. So in this part of
the course, we're going to be handling
the notification functionality where the
user feels threatened perhaps perhaps
there's a burglary underway and the user
needs armed response. The user can use
WhatsApp, send a message to a designated
WhatsApp number. Then the workflow will
subsequently check the relevant
spreadsheet. The spreadsheet that we
created in the last section of this
course will look for that user's
details. And if the functionality in
this notification workflow finds the
relevant row based on the user's
WhatsApp number, which uniquely
identifies the user, that means the user
has registered and the user's address is
part of the user's registration details.
So that information is then sent via
email to a person who's on duty. So
somebody will be monitoring their emails
to uh monitor the relevant panic
notifications that come through on
email. And within that email will be the
user's details. The person on duty can
then dispatch armed response to that
user's residence. So perhaps if a
burglary is underway, the uh responders
can appropriately these trained
responders can appropriately handle the
situation. Okay. So, let's create the
workflow. So, I'm going to hit this
button to do so. Create workflow. And
let's call this one
panic app notification
like this.
Great. So, we've created our workflow
and now what we want to do is add the
relevant trigger. Remember, each
workflow starts with a trigger node. So,
we're going to add the relevant WhatsApp
trigger because what the user is going
to do is send a message. And this should
only be like one character. It doesn't
have to be an actual message because
that might take too long for the user to
write, especially if the user's
panicked. So, the user might just send
the number one to the designated
WhatsApp number and then the workflow
can extract the user's WhatsApp number,
which will subsequently be used to look
up the user's details on the relevant
spreadsheet. So let's add the trigger
node. Let's So as per usual, the
relevant panel shoots out from the right
side of the screen and we can look up
the relevant WhatsApp trigger. So let's
type WhatsApp. Okay, WhatsApp business
cloud is the one we want. So let's click
WhatsApp business cloud and then we want
a particular option here and it will be
the
on messages.
So let's select on messages here. Great.
Excellent. And you can see I've actually
already created credentials
uh for WhatsApp. But we want to create
uh the credentials. We want to go
through the process of creating the
credentials step by step. So we're not
going to use this one. So let's create
credentials. And now as per usual, this
is the most arduous part of creating the
workflow. These workflows are quite easy
to create, but I do find uh creating the
relevant credentials somewhat fiddly.
Fiddly is the word. somewhat fiddly at
times. So anyway, so let's select the
create new credential option here.
Great. And you got the client ID and
client secret. So let's move on to the
next step. I'm going to go to my Safari
browser here. And then we need to
navigate to a particular
Facebook URL. So let's type Facebook
business here, business meta. And this
is the one we want. So it's
business.fas.com.
This is the actual one we want. And we
can log in now with our Facebook
account. Whatever your Facebook account
is, log in with that. And then you must
create a business portfolio. And you can
do that like this. See this option here,
Gavinon Digital, and then create
business portfolio. So this is the first
step. Create business portfolio. Okay.
Business. So, we need to give our
business portfolio a valid name. So, I'm
just going to go my
new
business
like that. First name Gavin, surname
Lon,
and put in whatever email address you
want to associate with this business
portfolio. So,
like that. And then hit the create
button.
And it's creating the new business
portfolio.
Excellent. Okay. My new business. G.
Okay. Gavlon digital Facebook. Great.
And then go next here. Just follow
through with the instructions.
Let's go next. Okay. And then hit the
confirm button here.
Excellent.
Okay, let's go to our business
portfolio. So, my new business and let's
click visit settings like this.
Brilliant. Okay.
And then we want to go to apps in the
left pane here like that. Click on apps.
And we don't have any apps associated
with our business portfolio. So, we
click add here to add an app.
We create
client app like that. So create an app
and
give our app a name. So I'm going to
call this my new app and it's already by
default selected the relevant email
address for me and then click next like
this. And then we have to select a use
case. And I'm going to select connect
with customers through WhatsApp. And
then press next like this. And we want
this portfolio. You can see I've created
a few portfolios here, but we want my
new business, the latest uh business
portfolio that I've created. Then I'm
going to select next like this. Okay.
And then
okay. And then let's click the next
button here.
Excellent.
Okay. Now, let's click go back to
dashboard here.
Okay. Excellent. And then it's asking me
to authenticate here.
So, I'm authenticating to go back to the
dashboard for my app, my new app.
Okay, brilliant. And now we can actually
go to app settings here. Go to basic.
Okay. And we have our app ID, which is
in fact our client ID. So we're going to
copy that there and paste it into client
ID in N810 in the relevant dialogue
here. And this is going to be called
WhatsApp Oorth account five. And the
five of course means it's just because
I've created uh several other accounts
four to be exact before creating this
account. And then get our client secret.
We can go show secret here. And then we
can just copy this client secret or it's
called an app secret in in uh through
the Facebook interface. It's there's a
client secret here. And we've copied
that in there. And then we can just
click save like this. Credentials
successfully created inside your
personal space. And that's what we want
to see. And that's brilliant.
Great. And we can actually just click on
the X and go out of this. Now we've got
our WhatsApp Oorth account 5. So we're
using OOTH Oorth 2 protocol to log to
Facebook and of course Facebook and of
course we're going to use WhatsApp
through Facebook through the app that
we've just created within our business
portfolio.
So now if we go to use cases here
in the left pane click on use cases
and then customize here.
Okay. Then go to quick start here. Click
quick start here. Click continue here.
Excellent. And then we can click the
start using the API button here.
And yes, it's a bit of an arduous
process, but we have eventually got
there. And you can see here
we've got a WhatsApp number that has
been created for us here. We've got a
phone number ID and a test WhatsApp
number that will be the receiver of our
WhatsApp message. So, we're the
panicker. We're going to press one, send
it to this WhatsApp number, and that
will kick off our workflow and send the
relevant email to the person on duty.
So, here we go. We got the test number
at that WhatsApp number. Brilliant. What
I'm going to do is I'm going to generate
an access token which means we can send
a test message to a designated WhatsApp
number. So I'm going to do that.
Generate a workflow.
I have to authenticate here.
Okay. I'm just going to select that and
continue. Sick the top option here and
select continue.
Okay. Save that.
Got it.
Okay. So, it's generated an access token
and I need to select the two option
here. I need to manage the phone number
list. So, I'm going to create I'm going
to create a WhatsApp number that I want
to send a test message to. So,
this will actually be the user. In this
case, I'm only sending this test message
just for testing purposes and then it'll
be easy for us to um we'll have that
test number within our messages through
WhatsApp and we can test our workflow
through that. Okay. So, I'm going to put
in my WhatsApp number here and that's
this is actually a valid WhatsApp
number. So, I'm going about to send a
test message to my WhatsApp number.
Okay. And I'm going to press the next
button here.
It's actually sending me a verification
code now to my WhatsApp number. I'm
going to insert a verification code now
that it's just sent me via WhatsApp. And
then I'm going to switch to the desktop
version of WhatsApp to test our
workflow. But we could of course test it
through WhatsApp here um through my
actual phone. But I'm going to just for
convenience I'm going to use my the
desktop version of WhatsApp for that
purpose. So hit the next button here.
Okay, great. So, we've now set that up
and I'm going to send a message. It
should send a test message that you can
see within this uh section of the web
page. It's detailed here in the curl
command here. And you can actually run
it in Postman if you like. But I'm going
to just send a message from here to my
WhatsApp
number. Okay. Press send message.
Okay, great. And there it is. Look at
that.
Hello world. So, we've got
Hello World. Welcome and
congratulations. This message
demonstrates your ability to send a
WhatsApp message notification from the
cloud API hosted by Meta. Thank you for
taking the time to test with us. Great.
So, now we can test our application.
We're in a position where we can
actually send a message to our workflow.
Great. So in fact, we can execute this
step here. So through N8. So let's go
back to the canvas. We've only got one
node. It's our trigger node, WhatsApp
trigger. We've wired it up to our
business portfolio, an app within our
business portfolio, which has provided
us with a test number. Okay. So let's go
into this trigger node here. And you can
see we've wired up the credentials.
WhatsApp Oorth account 5 successfully.
And now let's execute the step. So now
we're going to see that it's listening.
I'm just going to send the letter one.
So this is simulating a user panicking
from their phone. So they got their
phone here and they panicking. I could
do it from my phone, but I'm going to do
it on my desktop. So I could do it from
my phone to that test address there, but
I'm going to do it from my desktop. So,
I've entered in one, the character one,
and I'm going to send that through to
this WhatsApp number. So, let's press
the send button here.
Great. So, we've in fact got the users
details here. We've got the number that
uniquely identifies the user on the
spreadsheet. We've got the user's
WhatsApp number here, WA_ID.
And we can use that for the subsequent
step in our workflow, which will look up
the user. And that's my WhatsApp number
on the relevant spreadsheet. So let's
pin that data here so we don't have to
run another test through WhatsApp to
execute the next step in the workflow.
And we're going to move on to the next
step in the workflow now. So I'm going
to pin that data there.
Great. So let's go back to canvas now.
And the next step is we want to add a
Google sheet. So let's type in Google
sheet. So I want a Google sheet action
node here. Google sheets. Sorry. And we
go there and we want to get a row in
this. So get row in brackets s in sheet.
And we want to select this option here.
And we've actually already got an
account set up. Google Sheets account 3.
But we need to enable a specific API for
this to work. Google Cloud Console
console.cloud.google.com.
So let's click on this link here.
and we're on the current NAT panic app
project. This was the last app that we
created in the previous section of this
course. Let's go to this menu option
here and then API and services library.
So let's search for Google
Sheets
API.
Okay, this is the one we want. Let's
select that.
Okay. Read and write read and write
Google Sheets data manage. Try this API.
So, we've actually already enabled it.
That's what I wanted to check. Great.
So, we've got the credentials now to
read the relevant spreadsheet. And I'm
going to actually navigate to that
spreadsheet now
that we're going to read because we're
going to need its ID to wire it up. So
let's go to
sheets here.
Okay, it was panic app registration
here.
Excellent. You can see Gavin Lon and Bob
Jones have been added to this
spreadsheet. We registered those users.
This could now have, say, for example,
50 users. But when I panic, it's going
to have my WhatsApp number associated
uh with the message that I sent through
to the relevant test
WhatsApp number. And then this part in
the flow is going to
filter
the rows within the spreadsheet based on
the WhatsApp number that we're going to
extract from the previous node. That is
the WhatsApp trigger node. And that's
going to go through and it's going to
select the details. So the user's first
name, last name, address one, address
two, and then we're going to send that
via email in the next step to a Gmail
address that the person on duty can then
receive that panic notification and
dispatch armed response to the relevant
address. Okay, so we're on to the next
step here and which is going to be
reading Gavin Lon's
details from this spreadsheet because
based on the WhatsApp number that is
associated with the message sent
through. So it's Gavin Lon panicking.
Somebody's burglaring Gavin Lon's house,
burglarizing Gavin Lon's house and Gavin
Lon sends a one to the relevant WhatsApp
number and that engages with our
workflow. It then looks up Gavin Lon's
details on this spreadsheet based on the
relevant WhatsApp number and then the
subsequent step which we'll create in a
bit will send an email notification to
the person on duty and then the person
on duty can then dispatch on response to
Gavin Lon's address. So we're back in
N8N and we actually we need
to so we we've set it to get row rows
that's correct the operation sheet
within document that's all correct and
then from list so we don't want to do it
from list we're going to select from
we're going to select by ID for the
document field here and this is the data
that we want
so it's just before forward slashedit
so this is the ID the of the Google
spreadsheet that we want. So, copy that
to your clipboard. Then paste it into
this field here.
Excellent.
And then we can test whether it's able
to read that document associated with
this ID by selecting
in the sheet field from list the sheet
that we want. It should have present us
with sheet one and it has. And let's
select sheet one.
Great. And now we want to filter
we want to filter the row because it's a
get row operation and we want to filter
it on the WhatsApp number. So this
column
is we're going to select the relevant
column here and it's WhatsApp number.
You can see it's extracting the heading
headings from the relevant spreadsheet.
So let's select WhatsApp number here and
then we set this to expression and then
we're going to drag the WA
ID JSON field onto this value text field
here like that because that will be the
WhatsApp number associated with the
message that the user sends
which denotes the user panicking the
user requesting armed response. Great.
So now our workflow has the user's
WhatsApp number. Excellent.
So we could actually execute this step
from here. Let's click the execute step
button. And it should read the relevant
row. And there it is. Gavin Lon's
details, his address, name, surname, and
WhatsApp number. And it's worked. This
step has worked. and it's presented the
output within the right panel of the
relevant step here. Okay, perfect. So
let's go back to canvas and we want to
and we now want to perform the next
step. So there is actually another
reading of a spreadsheet and this is the
spreadsheet we want in this particular
case.
Okay. Okay. And you can see here we've
I've actually associated an email
address with each of the address two
fields. So each address two could have a
different email address which is
associated with the person on duty. So
each block may have a different person
on duty monitoring the emails for panic
notifications.
So block A, block B, block C, block D
here. And you can see Gavinon lives at
block B.
And I've actually just used the one
email address for all of the blocks, but
in the real world, you'd want to have
four separate email addresses which
relate to whoever is on duty. So
there'll be different people on duty for
each of these blocks monitoring the
notification emails coming through. We
want to add another one of these nodes
because we want to look up who's on duty
um for Gavin Lon's block in this
particular case. So let's go there and
we can go get and we can go Google
Sheets and then we want get rows get row
or rows. We'll use the same Google
Sheets account because we want to
perform the same thing but we want to do
it on a different Google spreadsheet in
this case. So let's click from the
document field. Let's click by ID. Let's
select the ID for data for this
particular
spreadsheet and we'll look up which
block that person lives in. So it will
be block B in this particular case. You
can see that here. Gavinon lives in
block B of the informal settlement. And
then we can select sheet one from the
relevant dropdown. And then we can add a
filter.
And this time we're going to be
filtering on the block name.
So select block name in the column. And
then we can drag the relevant field
which is address two for the values. So
it's going to filter that spreadsheet on
value. So it will filter the rows by
block name here and extract the email
address of the person who's on duty for
that particular block. Okay. Great. And
that's how you do that there. And now if
we execute this step.
Okay, brilliant. So it's got block B and
it's got the relevant email address
associated with block B. So that in the
next step, we can send an email so they
will receive the panic notification.
Okay. So let's move on to the next step.
Let's go back to canvas and let's add
the new node. So let's press the plus
icon there. And now we want Gmail.
So let's select Gmail and we want send
message here. Okay. So we've added the
send a message node here, the Gmail send
a message node. And we want to make sure
that we have relevant credentials set
up. So I'm going to use the same project
for this, but you can create a new
project by going new project and going
through the steps that we went through
earlier on in the course. just reference
those steps just to remind yourself how
to do that if you want to create a new
project for this. I'm going to select
the same project that we've been working
with here within Google Cloud. And the
next step I want to go to library and I
want to enable a particular API and
that's the Gmail
API here. So let's find Gmail API.
Select the relevant result and then hit
the enable button. So, we're enabling
the Gmail API because we want to send an
email from our workflow. So, we're going
to send the relevant panic details to
the person on duty for a particular
block, Gavin Lon's block in this
particular case. Okay. So, let's go to
credentials
and I'm just going to create a new Oorth
client ID here and secrets. So, to do
that, we can go create credentials here
and let's go Oorth client ID like that.
application type is
web application.
Okay, web client 2. Fine. And then we
have to add the relevant redirect URLs.
So go there and then we go back to N8N.
So let's go create new credential here.
And you can see here we've got this
field oorthth to redirect URL. We need
to provide that to Google Cloud here
within this setting here to set up this
new client ID. And then we can just hit
create like that. And now we can copy
the relevant details. So I'm going to
copy. We can actually press this button
here. Copy client ID. Let's go back to
NA10. Paste that in the client ID field
there. And we can do the same with the
client secret. Copy that there. and then
paste it to client secret field here.
And then we want to sign in with Google.
So let's do that. And this is so that we
can consent through the consent screen.
And let's select all here. So you can go
through these if you would like to see
all the relevant scopes. So this is just
whatever privileges you have are
consenting to here that NA10 can have um
regarding your Gmail account. So we want
NA10 to be able to send an email to a
particular email address. And let's hit
continue.
Great. Connection successful.
Excellent. So we are now ready to use
the these credentials. It's Gmail
account 4 because obviously I've created
credentials while I was preparing for
this course. So that's why there's a
four appended to it. And let's go out of
this. We're now set up with the Gmail
account for and we can send an email. So
here you can see that we've got various
options. We can actually select from all
the nodes in our workflow and we
actually want the results from the
WhatsApp trigger node here.
Um,
sorry. We actually want the result not
from the WhatsApp trigger node. We want
the result from the get rows in sheet
one
step here.
Okay. And we want to drag. So we want to
send this to the person who's on duty
for block B. So Gavin Lon lives at block
B. Gavin Lon is panicking because
someone's burglarizing his house. So he
wants armed response sent to his
address. So we want this email address
and that's the address associated with
the person on duty who's going to
receive the panic notification. So let's
drag the email to the two field here.
So that's the email address we want to
send this
email to and the subject will be panic.
So the person on duty will see panic and
we'll be able to respond. So the the
email will come through and in real time
the the person on duty can open that
email and read all the relevant details
about Gavin lawon and where to dispatch
armed response to because the part of
those details sent in the email will be
the user's
address physical address. Okay. And now
this is the most important part the
message. So we're going to have to get
data from the previous node in the
workflow. So it would be this node here
which contains all of Gavin's details.
So we can go first name like this. So we
need to set this to expression so we can
include variable data because it might
not necessarily be Gavin lawn panicking.
It could be Bob Jones. It could be
Sarah. It could be whoever. So we got
first name and let's drag first name
field here.
And then we want to include a new line
here. And we go last name.
And
let's include the last name field here.
Okay. And then we want address one.
Let's drag address one. So that's the
that's Gavin's in this particular case.
That's Gavin's house number.
Okay. Okay. And then we want to include
address two
like this. And we're going to drag and
drop address two, which is block B here.
So the responder will know which address
to go to to respond to the relevant
request for armed response.
Okay. And that and we want email type.
Let's just make it text here. So we're
sending an email that has a subject of
panic. We're sending it to the person on
duty for the relevant block, which is
block B. And we've managed to get that
data from through the execution of this
step here, which looks up who is on duty
for the relevant block, in this case,
block B. And then we we've got the
person on duties email address here. And
that's
where we're sending this particular
notification. So let's see if this panic
goes through to the relevant
person on duty for block B. Okay, let's
execute the step.
Okay, node executed successfully.
Okay, and let's actually go to my the
relevant email address here and check
whether that's come through. There it
is. Panic. And it's got all the relevant
details. Gavin lawn, address 12, block
B. And we could have sent through the
WhatsApp number in case the user in case
the personal duty or the responder needs
to phone the user who has put forward
the panic notification.
Okay, I'm going to unpin the data from
this first step here and we're going to
put that live by hitting this inactive
button here. And now our workflow is in
fact active.
So, we can now test out the entire
workflow here. So, I can actually do
that through my desktop version of
WhatsApp here. You could use your phone
to do this. As long as you're sending it
to the appropriate
test number, it will work. So, I'm going
to send a one, meaning I'm panicking. Or
it could be any character because we're
we're picking up this is this number is
designated as the number for to receive
panic notifications. So then it goes to
the next step and through the next step
we are able to extract the user's
WhatsApp number identify the user on the
relevant registration spreadsheet and
then we can extract the user's details
from that spreadsheet the address and
then those details can be sent to the
person who's on duty and then the person
on duty can dispatch the relevant
responder to the relevant address. So
let's send that one through.
Okay. and see what happens.
So, we've sent that through.
Okay. And let's check our emails. And
there it is. Panic. It's come through.
And we can check that Gavinon has
panicked. Okay. Perfect. So, our
workflow is working. Excellent. Right.
So, in this example, we are going to
automate the scheduling of first round
interviews for a job advertising for a
senior C developer. So how this works is
the applicant CV or resume is put into a
designated Google Drive folder. Our
workflow loops through each of the CVs,
so each of the PDF files. A summary of
the most important points are extracted
from the CV and sent via an email to the
person managing the interview process.
Based on the summary of the applicant
CV, the person managing the interview
process has two buttons available within
the relevant email. one labeled approve
and the other labeled decline. If the
person managing the interview process
clicks the approve button, an AI agent
schedules a one-hour in-person interview
with the relevant applicant the
following week at the earliest available
slot on the manager's Google calendar.
If the manager presses the decline
button, the applicant is not considered
for the position and doesn't get the
opportunity to be interviewed. So then
the workflow moves on to process the
next applicant's CV or resume, the next
CV within the designated Google Drive.
So this example deals with the concept
of a human in the loop. This basically
means that a human's discretion is
required at a point in the workflow
where at this point the workflow pauses
and waits for a specific action to be
performed by a human. In this case, the
workflow pauses and waits until the
manager of the interview process either
approves an application for an interview
or declines the applicant as a prospect
to fulfill the senior car position. So
the most important aspect of this
workflow is the concept of a human in
the loop. So we're going to take a
closer look at this now.
So with the assistance of chat GBT, I
generated eight CVS. So I'm just going
to show you where I've generated those
eight CVS. So if we go to
here, we can see uh in this Google Drive
folder, I've designated a particular
folder within Google Drive. So you if
you want to follow along with this
example, you you want to create a
designated folder where you'll put your
CVs for this workflow. And you can see
here I've got eight CVs that I've
created through chat GPT. Um the content
was created generated through chat GBT
and then I exported them to this PDF
format. Great. So let's create the
workflow. Okay. So I'm going to go to
NAN here and we've created our a
particular folder here called my
workflows. And I'm going to hit this
button here create workflow to create
our workflow example. And let's name
this workflow
interview
scheduleuler like that. Excellent. And
now we want to create our trigger node
within our workflow. So each workflow
has a trigger node and the rest of them
are going to be action nodes. So let's
create our trigger node. So let's click
this plus button here. And of course the
window shoots out from the right and we
can find the trigger node that we want.
And we want trigger manually.
So runs the workflow on clicking a
button
in NA10. Good for getting started
quickly. So we want to get started
quickly with this workflow. You could
for example have a node that actually
monitors the relevant G Google Drive
folder for changes. So if for example
three new CVs were put into that Google
Drive, this could trigger the process,
could trigger our workflow to process
the relevant new CVs. Then of course at
the end what you'd want to do is once
those CVs have been processed, you'd
want to move them into another folder.
And then any subsequent PDF files that
are put into the designated Google Drive
folder will kick off the workflow so
that those CVs that have recently put
into to that have recently been put into
the Google Drive folder are processed by
our workflow. So we're going to just for
testing purposes, we're going to use the
trigger manually node for our trigger
node here. Great. So when you click this
node, it will kick off the workflow.
Excellent. Okay. Okay, so the first
action node we want is a node that
returns all the PDF files. So it will
return all the PDF file names within our
designated Google Drive folder that will
be used to contain the relevant CVs or
resumes and are denoted by PDF files.
And we're going to search for Google
Drive.
And there it is, Google Drive. And let's
click on this option here. Okay. And we
want a specific option for uh Google
Drive. And we want
the search files and folders option
here. So let's click on this option
there. Great. Excellent. And you can see
that I've already got relevant
credentials set up to access Google
Drives. But we're just going to go
through the create new credential
process again. So I'm just going to
click create new credentials. So this
will give our workflow access to the
relevant Google Drive folder. And of
course we're going to use OOTH 2, the
OOTH2 standard to allow NA10 to have the
correct privileges to access the
relevant Google Drive folder. So we need
a client ID and a client secret. So we
are going to go to So let's go to Google
and we want console Google cloud.
So, we want to access
a specific URL and it is
console.cloud.google.com.
So, let's go there and make sure we're
logged on with our Google credentials.
[clears throat] Even though the name is
no longer really appropriate, n10 panic
app project. This is because we used
this project in the previous application
to do with a panic app, a security panic
app. But um we could rename this project
or create a new project. But just for
the sake of saving time, we'll stick
with this project. And the first thing
we want to do is to go here and go to
APIs and services library because we
want to find the relevant API. So it's
Google Drive API, right? Google Drive
API. So we search for Google Drive API
and we need to enable this particular
API. Google Drive API. Let's select this
result here and then click the enable
button like that.
Excellent. And then as per usual, we
want to go to credentials. And now we're
going to go through the process of
generating our client ID and our client
secret. So to do that we click create
credentials and then oorthth client ID.
Excellent. So application type is web
application.
Okay. And we'll leave that at web client
3. And then we need to this particular
URL. This is the oorthth redirect URL.
So click to copy. We need to add that to
this particular field. Authorize
redirect URIs. And let's paste that in
there.
and let's click create. And it's as
simple as that. We've got our client ID.
Let's copy the client ID over to NAD
here. And then of course, we need to
also copy the client secret. Let's copy
that and paste that in there.
Okay. Excellent. And let's save that.
Credential successfully created inside
your personal space. And that's what we
want. And then let's sign in with
Google. Now we need to provide consent.
So I'm just going to log in with my
Google credentials.
Continue.
And now we want to select all so that we
can use our Google Drive appropriately.
And we can just select all here and then
click continue.
Excellent. Connection successful. And
we're good to go here. Now we can start
using our Google Drive for our purposes
here. So what you want to do now is
create a Google Drive folder and paste
in all the PDFs that uh represent your
applicant CVs, your applicant CVs. You
can download those PDFs and you will
have access to this GitHub folder. So if
you navigate to this GitHub folder, you
can see the relevant CVs here that I've
created.
So Janet Winslow for example, you can
see here curriculum vay personal details
full name Janet Claire Winslow. We're
going to use an AI agent to extract
relevant details about a particular
applicant and that will get then sent as
an via email to the person managing the
interview process and then that person
based on these details sent to the
person can either approve or decline
this particular applicant and that is
the human in the loop. That is why we're
using a human in the loop because we
feel that this particular workflow
requires human discretion, but we're
also leveraging the power of an AI agent
to summarize the the relevant curriculum
vet or resumes if you like. You can see
we got personal summary, technical
skills, work experience, and it's quite
a long CV. So to speed up the process,
our AI agent will summarize the relevant
details so that at a glance, the person
managing the interview process can
glance at that summary on an email and
either just click a button, approve or
decline to indicate that the person
managing the interview process either
wants to see that applicant in the first
round interview or rather decline that
particular applicant for the senior C
position. So then whichever folder that
you've designated
the container for the relevant CVs here
and you can see there's eight of them.
The one we've just looked at is Janet
Winslow's CV here.
Um and what we need here is the ID of
that folder and you can see that in the
URL here. There's the ID of that folder.
So copy that to your clipboard here like
this. go back to N8 and then paste it
within the search query field. So we got
the search query field here. We want to
paste that in there. And we also want to
put that within single quotes. Okay.
Like that.
Okay. And then this requires a specific
type of query.
It actually requires an advanced search.
So this search method must be set to
advanced search. We've got the Google
Drive folders ID here.
And then we want to create a query. So
in parents, so this is just a specific
notation for our purposes here to query
that particular folder. So we've got the
relevant folders ID in parents and then
and and it's almost like a SQL query
really in its uh format and mime type
equals to then in quotations here we go
application
like that. Let's just make this a bit
larger. application slash
PDF. So, we're filtering out all the
PDFs within this folder. At the moment,
it's only got PDFs, but we still want to
be precise with our query here so that
if a text file ends up there or a folder
ends up in that particular folder that
it is filtered out. Okay. So, we only
want the PDFs queried from this folder.
Great. Okay. And I guess we could just
go return all here.
Okay,
we want to return all the CVs from that
particular folder. Great. So, let's
execute this and see if it returns those
PDF file names as output, which is what
I would expect. So, let's hit execute
step. Excellent. That's great. So, it's
returning the ID of the relevant file
followed by the name of the file. So,
you can see that the first
file is Janet Winslow CV.pdf. That's the
PDF that we actually looked at there.
So, it's returning the expected output.
Brenda Jones CV, Devin Ry CV, Jessica
Bailey CV, and we've got loads of
applicants for our senior C ro.
Brilliant. And what I'm going to do is
so that we don't have to run this step
continuously each time we test it, let's
just pin that data. Great. So, we've
pinned that data. Let's go back to
canvas.
So because I want to split out each
output item, i.e. each PDF file and
include a human in the loop pertaining
to each file, I'm going to include a
loop node. So a loop node, so think of
it as kind of like a for loop in
programming or a while loop. That's what
we're going to do. So we're going to
include this loop node so that we can
have a loop. Each iteration of the loop
represents the processing of a PDF file.
So, it's looping through all the PDF
files, downloading its content, and
summarizing that content, sending it to
the person who's managing the interview
process. The person at a glance looks at
that summarization of the PDF and either
approves the applicant or declines the
applicant. So, that's the human in the
loop idea, and we want to do that for
each CV. So, that's why we're going to
include this loop node so that we can
loop through each CV individually. You
can sort of get a sense that if we
didn't have that loop, it's going to try
to process all of these items in
parallel. And because we've got a human
in the loop uh in this particular
workflow, we don't want to do that. We
want to process each item individually
within a loop. So that is why we're
including this loop node here. So let's
look for loop here. Loop over item split
in batches. We want the size of each
batch to be one. one item.
Okay. And you can see it's created the
loop for us here. And we've got a
replace me node. And we'll replace that
in just a bit. In fact, I'm going to
just delete that. We don't need that.
Okay. I'm going to delete that. And
we're just going to eventually we're
going to loop that right round so that
we're processing each PDF file. But for
now, for testing purposes, while we're
building up our workflow, we'll just
remove those extra nodes that were added
by default when we added the loop over
items node here. So, we want to split
the output into a batch of one. We want
to traverse over each PDF file,
summarize the data in the CV, and send
it to a human in the loop as an email.
The human in the loop must then approve
the application or deny the applicant
before the workflow continues. So an
iteration per each PDF file will be
fired in the workflow. So in this case
that will be eight items, one per PDF
file. Right? So let's go back into this
node here. And if we execute the step,
you can see
that it is loop branch one item. It has
selected the top item here which is
Janet Winslow CV. PDF here. And that's
the top item in our list of PDF files.
So it's going to process each of these
PDF files one by one within a loop. So
each iteration denotes the processing of
a particular CV. Okay, great. So let's
go back to canvas and we want to now add
a node that will automatically download
the contents of the first PDF to be
processed.
So to do that, you can see we've got two
connectors here. Done. So this is when
all the iterations of the loop have been
carried out. We can add another node to
that. So you could add a say a Gmail
node that emails you once the all the
items have been processed. So you know
that the workflow is completed
processing all the items. But we want to
connect to this loop node because this
denotes that this is we want this node
to be run one
once per per each iteration of the loop.
Okay, so we want to add the Google Drive
download file node. So to do that, let's
click the plus here and let's go Google
Drive. Select Google Drive and then
download file like that.
Great. Okay, so we got the Google Drive
account 3 drive selected. I think we've
got the correct credentials here,
right? So let's go back here.
Let's go into the loop here and let's
execute step there.
Okay. And go loop branch one item. Click
that. And we've got that item available
here.
Okay. Let's go back to canvas. Let's go
to download file. And we've got our
input available to us here. And we want
to download the file by ID.
So you can see this is set to red
because it's empty. Let's set that to
expression. This file field must be set
to by ID. And then let's drag the ID
field value onto the file field here.
Excellent. Like that. And let's execute
the step here.
Okay. So the next step is we want to
extract from file. We want to extract
the relevant contents from this binary
file. So we need an extract from file
node connected here. Let's go there.
Okay. Sort out this workflow. Let's
click the plus button there. Plus icon
and let's search for extract
from file. And this is the node we want
here. And we want extract from PDF.
Great. Okay. Excellent. And now I think
all we need to do
is
execute the step and it will
extract the contents of this PDF and put
it into text format which is what we
want for our next step which will
summarize the text. We'll get an AI
agent to summarize the text before
sending that summarized information to
the person who's managing the interview
process. So let's hit the execute step
button and see what happens.
Brilliant. Look at that. So it's
actually read the contents of the PDF.
And this text field here contains the
extracted text from the PDF. And that's
what we want there. So we can now use
that as input for the AI agent that
we're about to create. And let's pin
that data to make life easy for us.
Great. And let's go back to canvas. So
now we are going to be creating our AI
agent.
Okay, so that's pretty exciting.
Okay, great. So let's hit the plus
button. Oops, not very tidy. Looks a bit
better. And let's hit the plus here. And
now we want an AI agent. So let's go AI
agent. Let's select this node here.
Okay,
great. and we want to firstly add a chat
model.
So, we're going to stick with the OpenAI
chat models. Let's go open AAI chat
model. And I like GPT4.1 Mini. So, let's
stick with that. We've got an OpenAI
account set up. If you don't remember
how to set up an account, please go back
to the relevant part of the video where
we set up an OpenAI account and create
the credentials to access it from NAT.
But I'm just going to stick with the one
that we've already set up here. And it's
which gives us access to the GPT 4.1
mini model here.
Great.
Okay.
So that's our model set up. Let's go
back to the AI agent there.
And you can see here this is red because
there's no JSON chat input
field available here. and we want to
replace this with a a
an appropriate prompt. So first thing we
need to do is select define below for
source of prompt user message. So we
define below and now we're going to
create a prompt and just to save time
I've actually
created
the relevant prompts for us. So let's go
into this particular file. You can just
download these files and use them for
your workflows.
And I'm going to just paste this
particular one here. You can see here it
says this is the prompt. It says please
analyze the following curriculum VTE
content and return relevant details
about the applicant and your
recommendation about the applicant
suitability to fill the position as
senior C sharp software developer. And
then we've got this JavaScript
expression here which will actually
contain the text that we've extracted
from the PDF file. So I'm going to copy
all this information here.
So this entire prompt I'm copying to my
clipboard. And then let's go back to NAN
and I'm going to paste it here for the
user message prompt. And you can see
this is green here, but I'm just going
to delete this this expression and show
you how you need to add that. So this is
the kind of base prompt here. And then
to get the content from the relevant CV,
we can just drag this text node at an
appropriate position onto our prompt
user message field like this. Great. And
it's green. And that's perfect. So we've
now got our prompt. So, we're asking the
model to summarize the content of the
person's CV, the applicant's CV before
sending that summarized content to the
person managing the interview process.
Okay, great. And we also can create a
system prompt. So, we want to define the
role for this particular AI agent, some
instructions and some rules. So we can
also
uh get that information from here. I've
already created that information for us
here. So we can just copy this here. All
of this here
let's copy that and let's create the
system prompt. So we want to hit add
option system message and then in the
relevant field
paste that prompt here. Okay. Okay. And
we can go through what what has been
written for the system prompt. So the
role this is all in markdown. That's why
it's got these um hash symbols here. So
these are the headers for each of the
prompt items if you like. So you are a
human resources employee. We're telling
the AI agent its role working for a
software development company. Your role
is to analyze curriculum vet of
applicants
for a senior development position where
the user must possess skills at a senior
level in C programming and have
appropriate experience developing
software using associated technologies
with C for example Net Maui or Blazer
instructions. Follow these steps in
analyzing a curriculum vite and
outputting relevant data in your
response. So number one, read through
the provided information. Get the
applicant's full name and email address
from the curriculum vite. Get the total
number of years of experience the
applicant has working with C and
associated technologies. Get notable
features about the applicant's
qualifications. Get notable features
about the applicant's work experience.
conclude as to whether you would
recommend the applicant for the position
of C developer. And then we have rules
here. C is the most important skill for
the applicant to have. If the applicant
does not have C experience, don't
recommend the applicant for the
position. So these are like guard rails
for our prompt. Okay, perfect.
That looks pretty good.
What we do want to help us with this
process is well-defined output. So a
well- definfined output structure and we
can actually do that. So we're asking
through an example. We're going to
provide a JSON example of how we want
the output formatted in JSON. So to do
that we first click this switch here
require specific output format like
that.
Okay. And then we're going to use this
output passer node here. So let's click
plus here for the output passer and we
want structured output passer this
particular node here. Great. And you can
see this is the sort of thing that it
accepts for this JSON example field. So
we're providing a oneshot prompt here a
oneshot example. And I've actually
created that example here. So we can
just copy this here.
You can see here I've already created
the JSON. We want full name, email, C#
years experience, notable
qualifications, notable work experience,
recommended, true. So we want the output
from our AI agent to look like this. We
want it outputed in that format. So
let's select the sample here and let's
paste in our particular example
for the JSON example field here. Okay,
great. So let's see what happens now.
Let's go back to the agent. We've got
that now done
and we can actually try that. So let's
execute the step and see if that outputs
a summary of uh
of the relevant applicant CV. So let's
try that. Let's go execute step.
Look at that. Amazing. Full name Janet
Cla Winslow.
Janetwinslowjanet.winsslow.devacample.com
and that's just straight from the CV.
It's obviously just a
madeup email, but it works for our
example. And then we got C# years
experience and this has been extracted
from the PDF. Six years experience,
notable qualifications.
So we got BSC BSC honors software
engineering from University of
Birmingham,
Microsoft certified Net Maui developer
associate Microsoft certified Azure
fundamentals a-
notable work experience six years of
professional experience with C andnet
technologies including three plus years
as a senior net developer. So the AI
based on that information, the AI has
recommended this applicant for a first
round interview. Recommended equals
true. So our workflow is coming
together.
Great. Right. So now we've got to the
point where we're going to include the
human in the loop functionality where
the
person in charge of the interview
process is emailed a summary of the
relevant applicants CV and then at a
glance the manager can look at that
summary sent to him via email can look
at that email and decide whether that
applicant qualifies for a first round
interview and we can actually use this
human in the loop functionality where we
can attach two buttons to the relevant
email, an approve button and a decline
button. So the manager in charge of the
interview process can look at that
email, decide whether that applicant
qualifies and then if the applicant does
qualify, press the approve button or if
the applicant does not qualify, press
the decline button. We're going to
subsequently create functionality using
an AI agent that will automatically
schedule an interview for 1 hour at an
appropriate time. And we will use the
Google
calendar API for this purpose. And we'll
use an AI agent to use the Google
calendar API as a tool and automatically
schedule the interview within the person
in charge of the interview processes
Google calendar. So we're going to use
an AI agent for that purpose in just a
bit. But for now, we're going to include
the human in the loop functionality. So
to do that, we press the plus icon
there. So we can actually see that
option there, human in the loop. So this
is the option we want. So let's click
human in the human in the loop option
here. And then we've got this Gmail
option. So this human in the loop
functionality is going to manifest as an
email that is sent to the person in
charge of the interview process where
the interviewer can press approve or
decline on the relevant email and that
will
automatically integrate with our
workflow and you'll see how this works
in just a bit. So let's click the Gmail
option here. Excellent. And it's
automatically defaulted to this account
here, Gmail account 4 for our
credentials because we've already set up
we've already set up appropriate
credentials for a previous sender
message Gmail node. So we can simply use
this and NA10 is smart enough to default
us to that particular account. So we
don't have to do anything here. um
resource, it's going to be a message.
Operation here must be send and wait for
response. That's very important. So the
workflow will pause until the human in
the loop, which will be the manager in
charge of the interview process, clicks
the approve button or the decline
button. So that's the correct option
there for the operation field. And then
for the two field, I'm just going to
enter my address because I'm going to
stand in just for the sake of this
example as the person in charge of the
interview process.
Great. So, we've got a valid Gmail
address there. And then for subject,
it's going to be
approval required.
So that will be the subject of the email
that is sent to the person in charge
of the interview process which I'm
standing in for that person in this
particular example. Okay, great. And now
we want to create we want to construct
the message. I'm going to just delete
this connection. What I want to do is
get some data that we can use for the
send a message step here. So, I'm going
to execute this workflow here.
Perfect. And that's executing.
Great. And we should have some valid
output here now. So, workflow executed
successfully. And I'm going to reconnect
that to send a message here. And then
I'm going to go into the send a message
node. And you can see now we've got lots
of data we can work with. Our AI agent
has constructed the correct output for
the
relevant summary of the information
regarding the applicant. Um, and this
was obviously extracted from the
relevant applicants
CV in PDF format for in this particular
case Janet Cla Winslow.
Great. And now we can use this data to
construct our message to the person in
charge of the interview process which in
this particular case is me. Okay. So
I've actually created that um example
for you to save you some time. The
example of the email message and you can
actually just download it or copy it
from this GitHub address. So from this
file that I've uploaded to GitHub, you
can just copy it here. So you can see
here applicant details and it's got a
JavaScript expression for the name and
email address. And then you've got
notable qualifications
and uh you've got the relevant
JavaScript expression there and that's
extracted from the summary that we
created in the previous node which is an
AI agent node and notable work
experience. And then my recommendation
here, and this is a more interesting
part of this particular message, is that
we've actually got logic here. And
we've got an inline if statement here
where we're checking if the output
recommended is true. If the
JSON.output.recommended
field is true, then we want I recommend
this applicant added to the relevant
email. And if it's false, we want I do
not recommend this applicant appended to
the relevant email that's sent to the
person in charge of the interview
process. Okay? And we can just copy this
here.
Copy it and paste it into the
appropriate field in NN like this. And
you can see it's already gone green here
the expressions meaning that it's
picking up the correct fields here. I'm
just going to give you an example of how
you would actually build that up. The
combination of static and dynamic
content within this message field. You
can see here you've got the fixed
option. We need it set to expression
because these are expressions, meaning
it's dynamic content included within the
message field. So for example, this is
how you would add the dynamic content.
So let's just delete that field here.
And we've done this before. So you would
just drag this full name JSON field from
the input in this particular case into
the message field appropriately like
this in the relevant position. You drag
and drop the JSON fields here. That's in
schema format. You can also put it in
JSON format. Okay. So we're pretty good
there. Approval required. And we've got
our message. So we could actually test
that at this point. What I'm going to do
is go back to Canvas here. Open
AI agent here.
Okay, I'm going to pin this data here
just to make uh testing a bit easier
here from within the AI agent that
proceeds in our workflow. This send a
message node here. Okay. And now let's
see what happens when we execute this
step.
Oh, sorry. There's one more thing we
have to do here. So, we need to make
sure that the both the approval button,
the approve button and the decline
button appears within the relevant
email. So, to do that we can add option
here approval options and we can
for type of approval we want to select
approve and disapprove. So we want two
buttons included within our human in the
loop functionality so that the person in
charge of the interview process can
either approve the relevant applicant
based on the summary sent via email to
the person in charge or can also reject
the applicant can decline the the
application through another button. So
we've got an approve button and a
decline button and you'll see that in
action right now. So let's execute this
step and see what happens.
waiting for input and now that is
correct. You see in the output here it's
got waiting for input. So this means
that the subsequent nodes we don't have
any subsequent nodes at the moment but
we will be putting in the functionality
to actually schedule an interview in the
next step uh of of this workflow. But
you can see it's still working. It is
working at the moment where it's saying
waiting for input meaning it's waiting
for the human in the loop to take action
some sort of action and in this case it
will be the action will be either
clicking the approve button or the
decline button and let's see that now.
So let's go to my emails here. So I'm
going to go to my Gmail account where
it's sending the relevant
uh
email. And you can see here it's got me
primary. It's got approval required in
the subject. And this is the email that
we want to look at. So approval required
in the subject. And let's open that. And
you can see here we've got the summary
of the applicant's
details. So we've got the summary of the
details that were included in the PDF
file sent via email to the person in
charge of the interview process. Years
of experience with C. Six. Notable
qualifications.

University of Birmingham 2016 Microsoft
certified and you can see all of this
has been summarized for us and notably
we have this decline button and this
approve button. So do we want to approve
or decline this applicant? Six years C#
experience. So at a glance you can see
that we probably want to approve this
applicant and also you can see down here
my recommendation that's the AI agent's
recommendation. So, we're including
intelligence within our workflow through
an AI agent. And this particular AI
agent has looked at that data and looked
at the criteria that we gave the AI
agent through our prompt and it's
decided that I recommend this applicant.
So, this helps us with our decision. The
AI agent is helping us decide whether to
reject or decline the applicant. And I
think it's clear that this applicant
should be approved. So, let's press the
approve button like that. And we get
this. Got it. Thanks. This page can be
closed now. Great. So, it's received.
Our workflow has now received the human
in the loop input. And a clear action
from the human in the loop is now sent
to our workflow. So, we've either
approved the applicant or declined the
applicant. And in this case, we've
approved the applicant by pressing this
approved button. Let's go back to our
workflow. So, you can see in NA10 here,
we've actually received the data. Let's
put that in JSON format. And you can see
here data
approved true. So this would have been
false if we had declined the
application. Okay. So let's go back here
and we can pin this data. Let's just pin
that data. Just makes it a lot easier
because we're stepping through our
workflow step by step. So makes sense to
pin our data there. So we don't have to
run through the entire process um when
we test our nodes as we add them to our
workflow. Okay. So let's just
so we can zoom out a little bit. Our
workflow is growing. This is sometimes
called flowgramming cuz we're creating a
workflow. Um this is like very
declarative process. We're not literally
typing out code. So it's flowming. But
there are a lot of similarities. We're
using a lot of concepts that you learn
in coding of course. So you got your for
loop there or your while loop, whatever
you want to got a loop and then we're
about to add an if condition through a
node. So very similar to programming.
You've got other things that are similar
to programming like separation of
concerns. We'll look at that in just a
bit. But so for now, let's
add an if condition. And we can do that
through the if node. Let's press the
plus icon here. Type in if. And there we
have it. We've got an if node like this.
So this is quite an easy part. We've got
our output that we pinch here approved.
True.
So for our condition, we can now
establish our condition. And we want to
so this is a boolean.
We want this to be a boolean condition
because we're we are evaluating
a boolean value.
So in this particular case it's actually
very s simple. We can just go if
condition is true like that.
So here we've got a expression here. At
the moment it's just hardcoded to false.
So we must go to the expression here,
remove that and then we can just drag
and drop the approved field which is now
in JSON format in this data. This data
is in JSON format and we can see clearly
the approved field and we can just drag
and drop that into the field here. So
this is very easy to read if
JSON.data.approved.
So this could be false but it's true in
this particular case is true. Then we
can attach another node to the true
condition
denoted by a connector connected to this
if node. And we'll see that now when we
go back to canvas. So let's go back to
canvas. And you've got true here and
you've got false.
So if the applicant has been approved,
we want to schedule
that applicant for a first round
interview. So, we want to add a node, an
AI agent in this particular case because
we're going to get an AI agent to
actually schedule the interview in the
person who's in charge of the interviews
calendar, Google calendar. So, that's
the next step. So, we can actually just
go
hit this plus button on the true
connector here. Hit plus and then let's
go AI agent.
And let's select the AI agent node here.
Okay.
Okay. We should have access to some of
the other data here. And we do. You see
all these other nodes here? We'll have
access to the
data that has been created through the
execution of the previous steps. And you
can see these are all stacked up in
order here. So search files and folders
that basically extracted all the names
of the files, the PDF files, looped over
each of these files, downloaded the
file, extracted the information from the
file. The AI agent then summarized that
information and sent a summary
email to the person in charge of the
interview process. The person in charge
of the interview process then clicked
either approve or decline. So if we go
to this note here, you can see that the
person in charge of the interview
process clearly approved
that applicant to be to go for the first
round interview.
Okay. So, we need to replace this user
prompt here.
So, let's look at the prompt. Let's go
here and look at the actual prompt. I've
created that already for you and it's
been uploaded to GitHub. So, it's this
one here, interview scheduleuler AI
agent 2 prompt. Let's open this and see
what our prompt looks like. I haven't
created a system prompt for this just
for expediency,
but um you can you can you probably
should create a system prompt basically
defining the instructions, the role of
the AI agent and the rules pertaining to
the behavior of the AI agent. Um but
just for speed, I've just created this
as one large prompt that I'm going to
put into the
the relevant field here. the user prompt
here. So firstly, let's go connect chat
trigger node. We don't have a chat
trigger node that it usually creates by
default um when you add an AI agent as
your first node. So we don't have that
chat trigger node. So let's select
define below here. And then we want
expression here. Okay. And then we can
just copy this prompt like this and
paste it into the field here.
And that is telling the AI agent how to
schedule the interview on the relevant
calendar. And you can see there's loads
of green here within the curly braces,
the double curly braces. And these are
dynamic fields, right? So you've got,
for example, interview with, and then
we've got the full name of the applicant
there.
And as demonstrated before, you can just
drag and drop those fields here. You've
got email one. So there's two people who
are part of this interview process. You
got the interviewer and the interviewee
and so they are part of this prompt
here. Let's go through the prompt.
So prompt user message. You are an AI
assistant
that schedules interviews in Google
calendar. Instructions fetch events.
Call the Get Calendar events tool to
retrieve all existing events between
Monday 12:00 a.m. and Friday
11:59 p.m. of the next calendar week
after and then the current date. This
expression represents the current date.
If today is within this week, you must
skip it. Only consider next week. Okay?
So, we're just being very clear with the
prompt. and then find availability is
the heading here. Analyze the retrieved
events. Identify the earliest available
1-hour free slot within working hours
from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. local time.
Do not select a time that overlaps with
an existing event. Do not schedule
outside the 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. time frame.
Only use dates from next week's Monday
to Friday window. So, I'm trying to be
as explicit as I can with this prompt.
And then we've got the schedule event
heading here. Once a free slot is found,
call the create calendar event tool. So,
that's what we're going to do now. We're
going to create that. We're going to add
that tool to our AI agent and we're
going to name it create calendar event.
So, let's go down here and you can see
here we've got tool. Let's press the
plus button here and let's look for the
relevant tool. So it's Google
calendar tool and let's select that
and the operation is automatically set
to create there.
Okay. And we've actually got an account
um already set up for our to use our
Google calendar tool. But we probably
need to we need to make sure that the
Google calendar API is enabled. So I'm
actually going to create new credentials
here and go through it step by step. We
want to select the create new credential
option here. And you can see we've got
the client ID and the client secret
available to us. And so we need to
create a client ID and a client secret
so that we can use the Google calendar
API. So, let's go to that Google Cloud
URL that we should be now quite familiar
with. It's going to go to Google
Google uh Cloud Console. That's what we
want. So, we want Google Cloud Console.
Great. And let's select this item here.
We're going to just use the same
project. We could create a new project.
I know the project name is no longer
really appropriate. NA10 panic app
project. That was our previous project
from a previous example. But we'll just
use this project because all we want is
credentials to use the Google calendar
API. So we can do that within this
project just to save time. But in the
real world, you'll probably want to
create a new project. So, let's go to
library
and let's search for Google calendar
API. There it is. Great.
And then let's select this top option
here, Google calendar API. And let's
click the enable button like that.
Okay, brilliant. So, we're enabling the
Google calendar API.
Let's go to credentials and we're going
to create new a new client ID
and client secret. So, let's go
create oorthth client ID here.
Let's select web application web web
client 4 is fine for the name and then
authorize redirect URI. So, add URI.
Okay. And we've got our URI here. It's
the same process. We've done this
before. Click to copy. And let's add
that there. So, we're integrating
the these OOTH credentials into our N810
workflow. So, that NAT can have access
to the Google calendar API through this
project. That's basically what we're
doing. So, let's hit the create button.
And then we've got a client ID and
client secret that we can use for this
tool. So, let's copy that client ID.
copied. Oops. Let's go to client ID
there. Let's copy the client secret like
that there.
Okay. And then let's sign in with
Google.
Okay.
Okay. Continue.
And of course, we have to consent so
that NAT can have access to the Google
calendar API. And let's select all. And
let's select continue here.
Great. So, that's done.
There. And we've we can just go out of
that there. And I'm actually going to
add another tool while we're here. I'm
going to add another tool.
So, let's go to the AI agent. And we
also want a tool that will get all of
the interviewers
scheduled events for next week so that
our AI agent knows what events have
already been scheduled and avoids
scheduling the interview on those dates,
the dates that have already been booked.
So, we need to get all of the events
that have already been booked on the
relevant person's calendar. Let's hit
this tool
option here. And then we've got another
plus available to us. So we can add
another tool. In fact, wait a second. We
have so we haven't rename we haven't
named this tool. We need to name this
tool in line with what our prompt has
called the tool and it's create calendar
event. So let's name this create
calendar event there. Okay, perfect.
Great. Let's go back to the AI agent.
So, that's been named and
there. We're going to create a new tool.
Create a new tool here. And this is
going to be
Google
calendar tool.
Okay.
And this tool operation must be set to
get many like that.
Excellent.
Okay. And we're going to name this tool.
Get calendar events. Here you can see
we're referring to this tool in the
prompt. So, let's name it get
get calendar events like that. Okay,
great. So, we're slowly getting there.
Okay, so we actually got Google Calendar
account 3. So, we can use the same
account for this particular tool as
we've used for
the the other tool that we're using
here.
So we're using the same credentials
Google calendar account 3 that we
created for create calendar event. We're
using that those credentials also for
get calendar events. Excellent.
Okay. So let's open the create calendar
event node that represents the create
calendar event tool. And you can see
here we've got start set to
now and end plus 1 hour. We actually
want to use the prompt to determine what
these values should be. So let's click
on this button here next to this start
field which has the stars icon on it and
let's press this button here. So this
means that this value will be determined
by the AI agent and that's based on the
prompt that we've given the AI agent.
And let's do the same for the end field.
So this is determining the start time
and end time for the relevant interview.
So uh we want the AI to
decide when that start and end time is.
And that logic is based on the prompt
that we've given to our AI agent. We can
actually determine which calendar to use
through this field. So if we click on
this field, you can see that a
particular Gmail address is presented to
you and that identifies the calendar to
choose and we can we have this item
presented to us because of the account
that we've created in the credentials
here. So that is automatically displayed
to us in the calendar field here. So
select that email or Gmail address like
that.
Great. So we got the prompt determining
the start and end time for the
particular interview. And the other
thing when we have the relevant event
displayed on our calendars, we want to
include certain fields. So we can
actually do that by adding a field here.
So I first want to add a attendees field
and there's two attendees. So I'm going
to add two of these fields. But firstly
let's click the star icon next to this
first attendee field here.
And this will and this means the same
thing basically that the AI agent
determines the value of this particular
field. So let's click the star here.
Okay. And let's add another attendee and
do the same. So it's going to determine
the two attendees
that uh will be at the particular
interview. So there'll be an interviewer
and an interviewee obviously and based
on the prompt that we've given to our AI
agent, it will be smart enough to
determine the attendees. Okay, great.
And we want to add a new field and we
want the description field there. And
let's click the
stars icon here. So, we've got
description and then we want summary.
Okay. And click the stars icon here next
to the summary field. Let's go back to
canvas and let's go to the get calendar
events
tool node here. And of course, we want
to also map this to the appropriate
calendar. So, let's see if our email
address is present within the list for
the calendar. And yes, we've got a valid
email address because we're using the
same credentials to connect from N810 to
to our Google account. So, we can just
select that email address to denote
which calendar to use for scheduling the
relevant interview. Okay. Excellent. And
then it's the same process here. We want
return all. So, return everything from
the relevant query here. And then we
want after before fields and we want the
AI to determine what these fields are.
So let's click the star
next to these fields after and before
like that. And this is because we want
our AI agent to intelligently determine
what the data for these fields will be.
So we want the AI agent to determine
what has already been booked the
following week
on the relevant person's calendar.
So when I say person, I mean the person
in charge of the interview process.
And then we also want the AI agent to
intelligently determine when to schedule
the interviews. And we're using and this
is why we're pressing these the star
icon next to the relevant fields for
each of these fields so that we're
relying on the AI agent to intelligently
determine the values of these fields so
that it can carry out the task of
scheduling the relevant interviews. and
we're using the get calendar events to
get all the events that have currently
been scheduled for the person in charge
of the interview process. So if we go
back to the canvas here and we go into
create
calendar event,
we are using these fields to
be displayed
on the relevant calendar
for the event. So, we're using this tool
to schedule the actual interview and
block off the time based on these start
and end fields here, which are being
intelligently determined by the AI
agent. And that's denoted by us pressing
the button next to the relevant fields,
which have the star icon on those
buttons.
And then here we know there's two
attendees and we want the AI agent to
intelligently determine who those
attendees will be based on the prompt
that we've given to the AI agent. And we
also want the description and the
summary of the particular event to be
extracted from the prompt and displayed
appropriately on the calendar. We could
actually execute this now and see if our
AI agent does what we expect it to do.
So let's execute
a workflow here.
Okay. And a chat model sub node must be
connected and enabled. Okay. So we
haven't yet given our AI agent a chat
model. So that's very easy to do. We've
done it before. Let's click the plus
icon here for the AI agent here. The AI
agent here. And of course, we want Open
AI. And we've got an account set up for
OpenAI. So, it makes it easy for us to
attach the relevant chat models. So, I'm
just going to click plus here. And of
course, the relevant window shoots out
from the right of our screens. And we've
got a number of models to choose from,
but we want Open AI chat model here. And
it's automatically selected the
credentials that we set up earlier. And
we want GPT 4.1 Mini selected here from
the model list. got a
a range of models to choose from here,
but we want GPT 4.1 Mini. Great. Okay.
Excellent. So, that's was why we got
that error when we tried to run this
workflow.
Let's try again.
Okay.
Excellent. workflow executed
successfully. So it should have taken
the first CV, processed it, and
uh we've we've actually approved that CV
because we pinned the data there. That's
why it didn't pause for the human in the
loop action when we ran our workflow. Um
because we pinned the data here on this
node here. So approved equals true. So,
it's gone through the entire process and
we can see now whether
an interview has been appropriately
scheduled. So, I'm going to go to my
Google calendar
here like this. I'm logged in with my
credentials. Go to my calendar and then
we've asked it to schedule the interview
for the following week sometime. And if
we go to Monday, the following week,
that's Sunday. Monday, look at that.
Interview with Janet Cla Winslow. Okay.
8 to 9 a.m. And there we have it. Those
are just fake addresses that I included
in the prompt for the attendees. So it's
an intelligently our AI agent has
intelligently extracted those email
addresses and included it as part of the
information pertaining to this
particular event that has been scheduled
on our calendar for the following week.
So basically our prompt is working. So
that's great. So I'm just going to
delete that because we're going to run
the entire process through now.
So I'm going to delete that. So don't
send right. Let's delete that there.
Let's keep that open. And we're going to
now go back to our
N8N workflow here. And so that is
fundamentally working. I'm going to go
back on these nodes here and I'm going
to unpin the data. Okay. So let's go
back to canvas. Let's go to this human
in the loop node here. This send a
message node here. Now I want to unpin
the data there so that we could run this
workflow through properly. Okay. So
anything that we any data that we've
pinned we want to unpin now because
we're going to run through all eight of
those CVS and we want them to be
processed appropriately and we want the
relevant interviews to be scheduled
automatically.
So let's unpin any data that's been
pinned.
So I'm unpinning the data here.
Great. And then we need to adjust this
workflow. Now we actually
want to connect this connector from the
AI agent. So once it's finished
scheduling the interview and this is
based on whether the human in the loop
has approved the application. So it goes
through the AI agent, schedules the
interview and then we wanted to go to
the next item in the loop. So to do that
we can just take that connector and
connect it to the loop over items node
like that. So it subsequently moves on
to the next applicant CV to be
processed.
And then we also wanted to do the same
thing when the applicant has been
declined. The approved field will be
false. Meaning that this connector false
here becomes relevant. In the event that
the human in the loop declines a
particular applicant's application, we
want it also to move on to the next item
in the loop to the next CV. We don't
want an interview scheduled so it
doesn't go to the AI agent node here. So
what we can do for the false connector
is we can connect that back into the
loop like this so that it actually
bypasses
the AI agent node here and then of
course won't schedule an interview on
the relevant calendar.
Okay,
great. Okay,
excellent. So, we're ready now to
actually run this workflow through in
its entirety. So, it's going to take all
eight CVs and process them. And with
each item in the process, there will be
a human in the loop. So, we will have to
open an email and either approve or
decline the applicant's application.
Okay. So, let's see this in action. I'm
going to go to Safari here and I'm going
to open a new tab here. I'm going to go
to my email. I am the person in charge
of the interview process. So, I'm the
human in the loop.
So, I should receive eight emails. And
with each email that I receive, in order
for the workflow to progress, I need to
either click the approve or decline
button,
which denotes whether I'm accepting that
applicant for a first round interview or
rejecting that applicant. so that
applicant doesn't go forward for a first
round interview. Okay. So before we do
that, there's one thing I'd like to
actually do in N8
um within the prompt here
and I urge you to do the same thing. So
I'm just going to open the prompt here.
And
this these fake email addresses here are
actually going to cause you to receive
uh mail delivery errors.
So you can see this portion of the
prompt, we have attendees
and two email addresses. I'm actually
going to include two valid email
addresses here so we don't get those
mail delivery uh errors because these
email addresses are are not real email
addresses. So these these are just
obviously example email addresses and
they actually wouldn't be hardcoded. You
would drag and drop the relevant email
addresses from one of the fields
um from one of the steps that's been
executed here. Um, so these would be
dynamic fields, but in this particular
case, I'm just going to hardcode them to
email addresses that I know are valid.
Okay. So,
okay, brilliant. I'm just going to save
that there.
Let's go back to canvas here.
And now it's going we're going to
execute this workflow in its entirety.
So the first thing that we're going to
see is that it's going to pause
and and it's going to pause for each
iteration. So it's going to pause eight
times, meaning we have to open the
relevant email and either approve or
decline the applicant. So let's run
through this workflow. Execute workflow.
And off it goes.
Okay.
And you can see it's paused at this
point here for send email. And this is
the human in the loop part of the
workflow. So let's go to I'm going to go
to Safari here. I'm going to go to my
emails and just refresh that.
And you can see here I've received an
email approval required. So let's open
that email. And you can see we've got
the summarized information about the
applicant. Janet Clear Winslow, that's
her email address, years of experience
with C 6. Okay, that's looking good. And
we can go through all of the summarized
information and determine whether we
want to approve this applicant or not.
And we've got the AI's recommendation,
my recommendation. I recommend this
applicant. So, let's approve Janet
Winslow for first round interview for
this role of C senior developer. So,
let's hit the approve button here.
Great. Got it. Thanks. The page can be
closed. So, we've approved Janet
Winslow. We can go back here and you can
see it's working.
Great. Okay.
It's going through and it's paused at
send a message and we should have
received another email for the second
iteration.
There it is. Approval required for the
second iteration of the loop. Four years
experience. My recommendation, I
recommend this applicant. So, I'm going
to approve this applicant.
Brilliant. Okay. Go back to Nad and it's
scheduling the interview for the second
applicant there. That's what our AI
agent is doing here. You can see it in
motion. That's very cool graphical user
interface feature where you can see
everything in motion and it's got to
send a message and it's stopped. So
this is the human in the loop part of
the workflow and we need to actually go
back to our
Gmail here and we need to approve or
decline this applicant. Let's see what
we've got here. Three years experience,
not too bad. Got some notable work
experience here which I'm impressed with
and qualifications. Great. So let's
approve
Craig Matthew Roberts. Okay. So approve.
Go back to n
scheduling the interview for
Matthew Roberts. Okay. And it's going
through the process and it's stopped at
send a message. So we need to do the
same thing. We need to either approve or
decline this applicant of the fourth
iteration. Fourth applicant. Let's go to
approval required here. Wow. So this
person's got seven years of experience.
We definitely want to see this person.
And the AI has recommended the
applicant. So let's approve this
applicant. Let's go back to NADN and
it's going on to the fifth applicant
application and it's going through the
workflow here. You can see and it's
stopped at send a message which is
predictable. So let's go here. So this
is the fifth iteration of the loop.
We've got eight to go through and let's
open this. No years of experience with
C. Okay, this doesn't look great. He's
experienced with Python. We need a C#
developer. Okay, I do not recommend this
applicant, the AI says. So, let's
decline this applicant. Let's go back to
NAN. And you can see it hasn't gone
through the AI agent one here to
create an interview event within the
relevant calendar. And it's actually
gone on to process the next applicant
and stopped at send a message. This is
the human in the loop part of the
process. So let's go back here
and see what
information has been summarized for the
sixth applicant. Four years C#
experience. That's looking good. I
recommend this applicant. Right.
Approve. Okay. So we're approving the
sixth applicant here. And as you can see
there, it's
going through the process of adding the
interview to the calendar,
scheduling a 1 hour first round
interview for this particular candidate
for the sixth iteration of the loop, the
sixth applicant if you like. And it's
stopped at send a message, which is the
human in the loop part of the workflow.
Let's go back here and let's see what
information we have for this next
applicant. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7. So this is the
seventh applicant.
Zero work experience. No, we can't have
that for C. I do not recommend this
applicant. So we're going to decline
this applicant. And let's go back to
NAND. And you can see it's gone to the
next iteration of the loop and it hasn't
scheduled an interview for the seventh
applicant. And we're now at for the
eighth applicant. We're at the human in
the loop part of the workflow. So let's
go back here.
to our Gmail. Let's refresh this. Okay.
And do we approve the eighth applicant?
Five years experience, C# experience.
Excellent credentials here. We like this
applicant. My recommendation,
I recommend this applicant, says our AI
agent. So, let's approve that.
Brilliant.
And it's processing the last of our
applicants there. And that's it. Our
workflow is executed successfully.
So let's now
go to our calendar and see what's going
on.
Look at that. So it's scheduled six
interviews for Monday, each in a 1 hour
slot. You can see Janet Claire Winslow,
Andrew Michael Johnson, Craig Matthew
Roberts, Brenda Marie Jones, Jessica
Lewis Bailey, Jessica Louise Bailey, and
James Edward Randall. They've all had
interviews scheduled. They all were
approved by our human in the loop
process here, and they've been
appropriately scheduled by our AI
agents. So, that is just awesome.
I'm really happy with that. And you can
see that it's added a sum a description
here. Interview with Janet Claire
Winslow interview with So it's extracted
the AI agent has determined the field
values that we want to see on our
calendar for us and it's also determined
at which times to schedule the
interview. So, so this is a great
example
of
using intelligence, AI intelligence in
your applications, in your workflows.
Okay. And now the last thing I want to
do here
is I want to extract
these nodes here, the AI agent one node
and the tools and the model, the sub
nodes that that are attached to the AI
agent here. And I want to put that into
a subworkflow. So, this is a way that
you can make your workflows look less
complex because, as you can see, there's
a lot of nodes here. It's becoming a bit
of a spider's web and we want to neaten
it up a little bit. So, we can actually
do that by
removing some of our nodes here into a
subworkflow. And I'm going to show you
how to do that now. So, I'm going to
copy this address here. I'm going to
open a new tab. So, we're going to nad
through another tab. and we're going to
create a new
workflow. So, I'm going to go to my
workflows here. Create workflow. And
here we're actually going to create a
new workflow, a new subworkflow. Okay.
So, so I'm going to bin this connection
here and I'm going to bin this
connection here.
Okay. And I'm going to copy
all of these nodes here. to select each
of these nodes.
Going to copy all of that and I'm going
to paste it here within our new
subworkflow
like that. I'm going to name this
subworkflow
AI agent
interview
scheduleuler because you see this
subworkflow could potentially be
executed with a few tweaks executed by
other parent workflows if you like. So
it's good practice to
separate concerns. So this can be its
own concern.
and then your workflows can actually
evolve and be worked on in parallel to
the other workflows
um without breaking the other workflows
that call this child workflow. So it's
very similar to programming concepts
when it comes to separation of concerns.
So we should strive to do that when
we're flowing with our workflows also.
Um, so you can see there's a lot of
commonality with flow programming and
programming.
We've got loops, we've got if
conditions, and we've got separation of
concerns. Now, okay, let's find the
execute subworkflow node. That's what we
need to do. This workflow is going to be
executed from another workflow. So, we
need to add this
execute
subworkflow node. to our subworkflow
here. So when executed by another
workflow, this is the node we want. So
it's a trigger node. Let's add it there
like that. And then we need to add two
fields because two field values are
going to be passed from the parent
workflow to this child workflow to this
subworkflow. So we want to add a full
name field here. So full name and it's a
string. And we want to also add email
like that. And it's also a string.
add field. Right? So those those fields
have been added. Let's save that.
Perfect.
Okay. Let's go back to canvas. And now
we want to connect that to our AI agent
like that. Brilliant.
Okay. So let's save that. We've got AI
agent interview scheduleuler there. So
let's go back to our workflow here. Just
going to leave those there for now.
Um, and we want to now attach
instead of attaching this AI agent and
all its sub nodes here, we want to
attach this to the sub workflow here. So
let's see how we can do that. So we can
go hit this plus icon here and we need
to
find the execute subnode.
There it is. The execute subworkflow
option.
And there it is. Let's select that. So,
let's select that.
Excellent.
Okay. And we've got a list of workflows
available to us here. Click that button
there. And we've got AI agent
interviewuler. So, let's select that.
Okay. And look at that. Our parameters
have been presented to us. full name and
email that we need to add information
to.
So let's do that full name. So the full
name will be the
name of the applicant.
Um so let's go to the first AI agent
here and let's drag in full name like
that. Full name there. You would want to
include the interview's email address
here. I'm just simplifying this example
for testing purposes. So, I'm going to
put in whatever email address here. So,
Craig John Johnsonhotmail.com.
So, this isn't even a real, as far as I
know, a real email address. Craig
Johnson@hotmail.com.
Okay,
great.
Let's go back here and let's try to
execute our entire workflow.
Okay. And we need to do the human in the
loop thing.
There it is. I'm just going to approve.
Let's go back there.
Problem agent. Reference note doesn't
exist.
Let's open this here.
Okay. And it's actually erroring because
of this here.
So the reason it's actually erroring and
you can see it in red here within our
prompt interview with is because we need
to wire it up to this full name field
here because obviously we've changed
from using the AI agent one directly.
We're now using this AI agent through a
subworkflow. So I'm going to remove that
there
from the prompt and I'm going to drag
that there.
So now that's turned green, which means
it's valid within our workflow, and that
should work. And we're not actually
using
an email address within our prompt.
We've actually hardcoded those values.
So this is just there for the sake of
the example. In the real world, you'd
want to have this email address inserted
into the prompt dynamically. Okay, let's
go back here. Um, let's try again. Let's
execute workflow.
Okay,
let's go to the human in the loop part
here.
Should arrive in our email soon.
Okay.
And I'm going to just approve this here.
Great.
Okay. Let's go back here.
problem in call to AIUL reference node
doesn't exist and we've received quite a
few errors here and the reason is is
that I'm
making a reference to this full name
field in more than one place so I
thought I'd fix the issue here but we've
also got a problem down here and you can
see that because this JavaScript
expression is in red here so let's
remove that and drag and drop full name
onto the prompt field here in the
appropriate So interview with and then
that's a dynamic field there. Right. So
we're back at our workflow here. So
we've actually copied and pasted that to
our sub workflow. These nodes here,
we'll delete them in a bit. We've got
this call AI agent interview node here.
Now that we've created it executes the
sub workflow and we've set this up
accordingly.
Now let's try and run through our
workflow again.
execute workflow and hopefully
everything works accordingly. So it'll
get to the send a message. This is the
human in the loop part. It's a bit
annoying having to go back here every
time and for testing. So you might want
to pin your data when testing this
process. Um so I'm just going to open
this email and then I'm going to approve
it and go back to NAN.
Okay. And it's calling the AI agent
interview
subworkflow node. Workflow executed
successfully.
Great. So now we have successfully
extracted
these nodes that to do with the AI
scheduling sorry the calendar interview
scheduling functionality and we've put
it into its own subworkflow and we're
calling it from the main workflow here.
So we've created a separation of
concerns and we could actually reuse
this potentially with a few tweaks.
reuse this subworkflow from other parent
workflows for from other main workflows
to actually handle the scheduling
functionality. So we go back here and we
can delete these now because we're
executing those from our sub workflow.
And then we want to connect this back to
the loop.
So once it's finished scheduling the
interview for a particular applicant, we
want it to go to the next applicant in
the loop. So let's connect that now to
the loop. And now we can just go and
test the entire workflow and it should
work
as expected.
Excellent. So let's do that. Let's go
for it. So, we're now testing the entire
workflow.
And of course, it's going to pause at
the human in the loop section here.
And if we go to our calendar,
you can see we've got loads of
interviews scheduled, and it seems to be
working. It seems to have avoided
double scheduling an interviewee
for a first round interview and it's
created a whole bunch more interview
events here. I'm not saying that that
prompt is going to be perfect. It might
not work uh as expected all the time for
scheduling the actual interview. This is
more about the workflows and it's a
beginner's course. So, I haven't gone
deep into prompt engineering. So, you
may have to add more detail to your
prompt. And that's what it's all about.
It's about being explicit with your
prompts to get the functionality you
want out of your AI agents. So you may
have to be a little bit more
sophisticated with your prompt
engineering for this particular part of
the workflow,
but it basically works. The idea at
least comes across with this example.
So in this part of the video, we won't
be building and demonstrating creation
the creation of workflows step by step.
This is just to show you a few extras.
Hopefully some while we do this, some
ideas will come flooding to you and you
can create the next big thing. So check
this out. Going back to the first
example. So, we had this example here
where we created a chatbot, but we're
using the integrated chat message
received trigger here to converse with
our chatbot here, which is simply just
sort of like a ranking app where you can
ask the AI agent questions about uh you
know, what are the top five best rugby
players in the world or what are the top
five best rugby nations in the world,
which is what we asked our chatbot
earlier. What are the top five richest
countries in the world? Top, you know,
that sort of thing. So, so we could ask
um what are the what are the largest
mammals on Earth?
Blue whale, fin whale, sperm whale,
humpback whale, African elephant. Cool.
So, our chatbot is working. But what I
wanted to show you here is we can
integrate whatever interface we want for
our chatbot using NADN. So I've prepared
this example here, example one chatbot
with WhatsApp. So we worked with
WhatsApp when we created the panic app.
But what I've done here is instead of
using that integrated input
utility that we just used to converse
with our chatbot, I've attached a
WhatsApp trigger here. And I've set up
WhatsApp appropriately. And we should be
able to use WhatsApp now to to converse
with our chatbot and ask our chatbot
various questions about ranked items in
the world. Like for example, what are
the top five movies of all time? Okay,
great. So I'm going to execute workflow
there.
Okay, excellent. So that's executed.
This is the desktop version of WhatsApp.
Of course, you could use your actual
phone for this. Now, I should be able to
converse with my chatbot. So, what are
the
top five fastest cars on Earth?
Excellent. And there we have a response
from our chatbot. So, that seems to be
working correctly.
Who are the top five movie stars
in the in the world?
So, let's put that live. I'm just going
to
switch that to active like that.
Okay. So, this should be live now and we
should be able to run that now. So, who
are the
top five movie stars
in the world?
Excellent. Dwayne Johnson, Scarlett
Johansson. I mean, this is obviously up
for debate. Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Cruz,
Jennifer Lawrence. Okay, cool. Who would
be the next five? Remember, we've
actually added memory, simple memory
here. So, our chatbot should retain
context. So, we should be able to
converse with our chatbot. So, who would
be the next five? Let's see what our
chatbot says.
Brad Pitt, Natalie Portman, Robert
Downey Jr., Angelina Jolie, Chris
Hemsworth. And of course, you're not
restricted to WhatsApp through NN. You
could, for example, use
Discord,
you could use Telegram, and there's many
integrations that you can choose from
here. So, we created the registration
part of our WhatsApp panic app here. And
you can see here we created this
trigger.
So, you can see here it's actually using
the N8N created form. But what if we
wanted to integrate this data capture
form within our own website for example
or we wanted to integrate it into a
third party website for some reason so
that the user could register from
another website. Well, I've prepared
this example
where we can actually use a web hook to
accept any data posted via HTTP
to our web hook to a web hook that we
create within our N810 workflow. So, if
we open this particular example here,
you can see here we have this web hook
node here. So if we go into that web
hook node, what I'm going to do here is
I'm going to copy this URL here and we
can execute that workflow. And then I
can use an application like
Postman
to
post
data via HTTP to our web hook. That's
how we can integrate our form that
resides within a thirdparty website with
our N810 workflow. Rather than just
using the default web form that NAT
provides, we can use our own web form
integrated into our website and submit
this data via HTTP
to a web hook which has its own URL. You
can see here it's got its own URL. Okay,
one for testing and it's currently
listening. One for testing and one for
production. But it's currently waiting
for us to send that information to send
that data. So if we send that great
workflow has was started. So it should
have workflow executed successfully. So
let's look at our spreadsheet.
There it is. Our information has been
registered. So this user Howie Plunk has
been registered for the WhatsApp
Panic app.
So that's great. So that's kind of
showing you how NAN is not restricted to
the integrations that you can use from
within N810 like WhatsApp, Discord or
whatever. You can also
integrate your own custom websites into
your workflows using a web hook for
example. Okay. And now I want to show
you another way in which N8N
is not restricted is that you can
actually make HTTP requests from your
N8N workflow and you do that using the
HTTP request node. So I've prepared this
example here
and this is kind of was kind of
experimental so it's a little bit messy
but I just want to show you a few things
here. So we got the HTTP request node
integrated here into our application. If
we open that, you can see there's a
specific
URL that I want to make a get request
to. We recently published a go, a
jinonic go on free code camp. And this
is one of the endpoints that I created
using go and it basically returns a list
of movies with this associated genres
and the sentiment attached from movie
reviews to the relevant movies. So
I just want to show you how we can
actually make a call to this particular
endpoint from within an N810 workflow.
So we can use that information returned
from an endpoint of a custom application
that we've created and we can use that
as the data for a chatbot application or
an AI agent application.
So it's just starting the instance. I'm
just waking it up here. Great. And it's
returned the movie information that I
want. So you can see a shaw shank
redemption and we're using the HTTP
request node here. So we can execute
this step here. And you can see
it makes a request to the endpoint the
endpoint that is part of the magic
stream application and it returns data
about the movies here. Then I found that
because of the levels in the hierarchy
here that I was unable to effectively
prompt the AI agent. Here I think is
quite a good example of how you can use
code to reformat your data before it is
sent through to another node like this
AI agent node for example if you needed
intelligence to reside within your
workflow. So what I was able to do so
from this node is outputting the data
that has been returned from the relevant
endpoint
in magic stream and then I was able to
create this JavaScript code using the
code node from within N810 that flattens
out the data as it were. So it flattens
this hierarchy into a more readable
format for our AI agent. So this is a
classic example of how you can integrate
code into your N8 workflows. And here
I've integrated some JavaScript code so
that I can take the inputed data that
could be returned for example as is the
case here from an endpoint
and I'm flattening out that data so that
it is more digestible if you like for
our AI agent here.
And that's all that that code does.
transforms this data from one format to
another and that's for a specific
purpose so that our AI agent can read in
that data and provide us with
intelligent responses based on the data.
So if we go back to canvas here got
another example here.
So we've got this HTTP request where we
can post requests and make get requests
to a specific endpoint like an API. You
could also use this HTTP request node
for web scraping. You could navigate to
a specific HTML web page and scrape
relevant data through subsequent
functionality. But for this example
here, what I was able to do
was use a HTTP request tool. So that's
slightly different from the HTTP request
node. We've also got the HTTP request
tool that you could add as a tool to
your AI agent. And I actually found that
using this tool, I didn't have to create
any JavaScript to flatten out the data
in order for this AI agent to digest the
data returned from the call to the
relevant magic stream API endpoint. I
found that it was actually able to read
that data effectively and make
intelligent responses. So
you can see here your role is to provide
helpful insights about movies and your
instructions.
Please use the HTTP request tool to get
the data for the movies which will be d
which will be a data source used for
responding to user queries. So, we've
got our prompt all set up there and
we've got our chat input.
What do you recommend for movies in the
thriller genre and let's execute this
step and see what happens.
Okay, so let's this is what we get back.
For thriller genre, I recommend Knives
Out. Excellent ranking with a fantastic
story and sublime acting. Blitz
excellent rating described as a lovely
movie. Jack Reacher also rated excellent
offering a wonderful experience. These
are top rated thriller movies from the
data. So it's read in the data and it's
provided us with an intelligent response
based on the data. So it's used the HTTP
request tool to read the data returned
from the relevant magic stream API
endpoint. So that's just a list of
movies with associated genres and
relevant ratings and movie reviews with
the sentiment extracted from those movie
reviews saved within that data. And
based on that data, our chatbot has
created this intelligent response
to our query.
What do you recommend for movies in the
thriller genre? So, I just wanted to
show you those examples
to hopefully illustrate how there are
very few limitations as to what you can
do with these workflows. So, they are
very, very powerful.
I hope you've enjoyed this video as much
as I enjoyed creating it.
Please let me know what workflow
automation ideas you've come up with so
that I can steal your idea and make a
billion dollars. I would never do that.
Maybe keep those billion dollar ideas to
yourself. I hope to see you soon. Thank
you and take care."

course for beginners. Vue.js is a
progressive JavaScript framework known
for its simplicity and versatility. In
this course, you will learn how to use
Vue.js to build fully functional
interactive applications. And by the
end, you'll be able to create a clean,
organized, and productionready
application that utilizes all the
fundamental features of Vue.js. Rachel
Johnson from Scribba developed this
course.
Welcome to Scribba's Learn View course.
This is a beginner-friendly journey that
will help you master the fundamentals of
Vue.js. Whether you're new to JavaScript
frameworks or looking to add Vue to your
toolkit, this course is designed to get
you up and running. In this course,
you'll learn the basics of Vue, one of
the more popular JavaScript frameworks
for building user interfaces. Vue is
known for its simplicity, flexibility,
and performance, making it an excellent
choice for both small projects and large
scale applications. As we learn about
Vue from the ground up, we'll be
building six Vuepowered projects that
are perfect for practicing your newfound
skills. By the end of the course, you'll
have a solid foundation in Vue and the
confidence to start building your own
projects. We'll start with a simple
viewfax page where we'll learn how to
display dynamic data within what's
called components. Then we'll create a
page from Grammar's recipe book. This
simple app lets users click between
photos, ingredients, and instructions,
all using data from external files. Next
up is this animal shelter listing where
you'll learn to filter data by type and
display dynamic descriptions. Our fourth
project is a daily gratitude pad where
you'll build a realtime journaling app
that timestamps and displays your
entries throughout the day. Getting more
advanced, we'll create a Pokédex
application that pulls data from an
external API. The perfect way to learn
how Vue handles external data. And for
our capstone project, you'll build
definition detective, a word guessing
game that uses a dictionary API to
display real definitions as part of the
gameplay. Now, don't worry if some of
these projects sound complex. We'll
break everything down into manageable
steps, and by the time you get to the
project, you will have all the skills
that you need. In section one, we're
going to focus on getting started with
Vue. We'll start by introducing Vue,
what it is, and why we should learn it.
You'll learn how to create your first
Vue app using a CDN, turning a static
web page into a dynamic one. Then we'll
install Vue locally using create Vue,
the official Vue project scaffolding
tool and you'll explore the anatomy of a
Vue project. Now before we go ahead,
let's talk about prerequisites. Since
this is a Vue course, it is important to
have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript. Vue builds on these
foundational technologies, so
familiarity with them will help you get
the most out of this course. I'm Rachel
Johnson and I'll be your instructor for
this Learn View course. I'm a lifelong
learner, passionate teacher, and a big
believer in making learning accessible
and fun. So, let's dive into Vue
together and build some amazing things.
Let's start with a super important
question. What is Vue? Well, Vue is a
progressive JavaScript framework that
makes building user interfaces and
single page applications a breeze.
Created by Evanu in 2014, Vue has grown
to be one of the more popular front-end
frameworks in the world alongside React
and Angular. In this course, we'll be
focusing on Vue 3, which is the latest
major version of the framework. At the
time of this recording, the latest
stable release version is 3.5.17.
Now, view likely would have updated by
the time you're learning. So, there
might be some slight differences between
what you see here and what you encounter
in the real world. But don't worry, if
the changes are significant, we'll be
sure to update your learning experience
accordingly. So, with so many other
options out there, why should we learn
Vue.js? Well, it isn't just another
JavaScript framework, and the numbers
really back this up. Stack Overflow's
2024 developer survey shows Vue as the
fourth most popular front-end JavaScript
framework with an impressive 60.2%
admiration rating, which is just 2%
below first place. The State of
JavaScript 2024 report paints an even
more compelling picture with Vue ranking
second in usage, awareness, and
developer positivity, and third in
interest, and retention. And these
rankings have either held steady or
improved over the last few years. The
open-source community's enthusiasm for
Vue is evident in its GitHub statistics
with over 28,000 stars and 33,000 forks.
But it's not just independent developers
who love Vue. Industry giants like
Adobe, Nintendo, the Alibaba group along
with popular services like Zoom, GitLab,
Grammarly, Netlefi, and Trust Pilot all
use Vue in their production
environments. And perhaps the most
telling is Vue's consistent growth in
adoption. 5 to 6 million weekly
downloads on npm with steady
year-over-year growth. These numbers
aren't just statistics. They represent a
thriving ecosystem and a framework that
is here to stay. This means that
Learning View isn't just about picking
up another tool. It's about investing in
a skill that's increasingly valued in
the job market and supported by a robust
growing community. Time to stop talking
about Vue and start actually using it.
In the next Grim, we'll take our first
hands-on steps with Vue by exploring
some core concepts and setting up a
developer environment. Are you ready to
start building? Let's jump into some
code.
Before we dive into setting up Vue
locally or using build tools, we're
going to start with something simple,
which is using Vue via a CDN. This means
we can include Vue in our project with a
script tag in our HTML file. This will
let us skip the setup process for now
and jump straight into making those
fingers busy. You'll see how easy it is
to get started with Vue and how powerful
it can be even in its simplest form. If
you're new to Scribbler, this editor is
where the magic happens. You're able to
see live code examples, pause me at any
time and edit the code directly to try
things out yourself. When I present you
with challenges, which I will throughout
the entire course, the editor will pause
automatically and let you have a go in
your own time. If you're following along
on another platform like YouTube, we'll
talk about how to install Vue locally in
a few scrims time so you can practice in
the comfort of your own IDE. But for
now, I invite you to hop on over here to
scrimmer.com to get your fingers busy
with Vue. For our very first Vue app,
I've put together a very basic HTML
file. We'll include Vue via the CDN and
then use Vue to display a message on the
page. This will give you a pretty good
taste of Vue. And in the next scrim,
you're going to give it a go yourself.
To start using Vue, we're going to
include the library using a CDN. And to
do that, all we have to do is add a
script tag in the head of our HTML file
right here and specify the source
location just like any other CDN. And
the best place to grab the CDN source
URL directly is the official Vue
documentation. Now, I've already copied
the script tag. So, I'm just going to
pop it right here. And now, once I've
saved, we have access to all the
features of Vue3 and we can start using
it directly in our application. Now,
view works by attaching itself to a
specific part of the HTML, usually a
div, and then controlling what happens
inside of that element. So, first we're
going to wrap everything in the body tag
inside of a div and give it an id of
app. So, div with an id of app. And then
I will also close the div and then
indent everything inside of it. Now,
let's have a look down here at the H1
where it says hello world. We're going
to use Vue to change out the world of
hello world to a name of our choice that
we'll define using Vue. To prepare for
that, I'm going to replace this world
with this curly brackets name and then
closing curly brackets. And once we
save, we can see that that has been
reflected in the preview. Now, notice
the curly brackets. This is Vue's text
interpolation syntax. We will get more
into this later, but for now, just know
that it will tell Vue to render the
value of a name variable inside of the
H1 tags. But what is name? Well, we're
going to define that in our JavaScript.
So, in order to use JavaScript, we're
going to open script blocks down here.
And this is where we're going to start
using Vue. I'm going to type up a bunch
of code, but I will explain it as I go.
So, first is const create app and ref
equal view. What's happening here is
that I'm grabbing the create app and ref
functions from Vue. These are functions
that we will explore more of throughout
the course. So don't worry too much
about them right now. Just know that I'm
essentially importing them so we can use
them. Next up is create app and then
brackets and then curly brackets. With
this line, I'm using the create app
function that we just imported right
here to you guessed it create a view app
instance. Everything inside of it
defines how the app will behave. So
inside the curly brackets, I'm going to
start with a setup function. This
function gets run the moment that our
app loads. And this is where we'll
define our data and logic. So let's add
some data. Create a constant with the
name of name. And here I'm going to type
ref and then Rachel. Ref is something
that we'll explore later. But for now,
think of it as a view variable. Then we
have to make sure we can access name
from the HTML by returning it. So return
name and finally down here at the
closing bracket of our create app we're
going to add mount and then we're going
to specify something with an ID of app.
Do you remember that div earlier up
here? This is where it all connects up.
Everything that we've done in this
script block inside of this create app
function will apply to the div with an
ID of app. And once we save, we can see
that our preview now shows hello Rachel
rather than hello world. So what's
happening behind the scenes? When the
page loads, view takes over this div
with an id of app and it replaces this
name with the value of name which we set
and returned down here in our
JavaScript. And just like that, you've
learned the very very basics of Vue and
how we can extend a standard HTML file.
In the next scrimm, you're going to take
a static web page just like this one and
turn it into a view app just like what I
did in this scrim. So, I will see you
there.
Welcome to your first challenge of the
course. This scrim was designed to give
you a hands-on opportunity to apply what
you've learned in the last scrim. Here,
I've put together a simple 404 page that
has a few elements to it. There's a span
with an emoji, a H1 with an error code,
a P tag with some error text, and a
button. I'd like you to have a go at
getting this vanilla HTML page set up
with Vue, and then use Vue to change the
text content of these four elements.
Now, while you can skip challenges here
on Scriber, I really encourage you to
give it a good go. After all, the best
way to learn anything is to do it. So,
here is your challenge. Turn this static
404 page into a view app using the CDN.
Then make it your own by using a
different emoji, status code, and text.
To do that, I've split it up into five
steps. First, you'll have to include the
view CDN. And then you have to prep your
HTML by wrapping everything in a div
with an ID of app. And then in new
script tags, you'll have to import the
create app and ref view functions. Then
create a view app instance and mount it.
And finally, you'll have to create the
four ref variables and use them to
change the text content of the four
elements, which is the span, the h1, the
p, and the button. Now, if you need to,
I have popped the exact syntax that
you'll need over here in hint.md. But do
try to give it a go on your own first.
And remember, you can always refer back
to previous scrims if you need a quick
reference. Give it a go now, and I'll
walk you through how I'll do it
afterwards.
Welcome back. How did you go? This is
what I would have done. So, first we'll
include view via the CDN. And I'm going
to do it just before the closing head
tag. And then I'll prep the HTML by
wrapping the body content, which is all
of this inside of a div with an ID of
app. So, div with an id of app. And
we'll close that. And then also indent
everything. Now we can swap out the
static content for all four HTML
elements and replace them with the
dynamic content using those curly
brackets. Instead of this hard-coded
emoji, I'll pop in some curly brackets
and replace it with the word emoji. And
I'll do the same with this 404. Some
curly brackets and I'll call it status
code. Moving down to the P tag, we'll
replace this entire line with curly
brackets status message. And then
instead of the buttons go back to
safety, we'll replace it with curly
brackets and button_ext.
And now we can see that the preview has
changed. And it looks like this because
we haven't actually created the app yet.
So let's go and do that. Before the
closing body tag, we're going to create
our script block. Script script. Inside
the script block, let's import the
relevant view functions. So const, we're
going to import create app as well as
ref from view. And then we'll create the
view app instance and also mount it
right now. So create app, we'll leave
this blank for now. And on the other
end, we're going to mount it to
something with an id of app. Now that
we've created the app and also mounted
it to the div with an ID of app. These
emoji, status code, and status messages
are now looking for the matching
variable, which doesn't exist yet, and
therefore it's showing nothing. So let's
get those variables set up. Inside of
the curly brackets, we're going to use
the allimp important setup function.
Remember, the code in here gets run when
the app starts. So, inside of the setup
function, we'll create the four
variables. One for each of these
elements that we've prepped earlier. So,
first the emoji,
making sure to use the ref function. And
here, I'll just use a monkey. Next is
status code. And here, let's just do
500. Next is the status message. And
we'll do something super short. server
is sleeping. And finally, the button
text.
And here we'll just show my age. Bye by
by. And now to make sure that the HTML
can access these variables, we will
return them. So return emoji, status
code, status message, and button text.
Save. And there we go. Great job on that
challenge. You've just taken a static
web page and turned it into a dynamic
Vue app by making parts of it reactive.
That's a big step forward and you should
feel proud of what you've accomplished.
V's reactivity system is powerful. And
you're already starting to see how it
can make your applications more dynamic
and easier to manage. Now, I know this
seems super simple at the moment, but
trust me, Vue gets a lot more exciting
very quickly. These first few scrims
were just about getting your brain
thinking the Vue way and getting your
fingers busy with the basics. In the
next scrim, we're going to leave the CDN
behind and install Vue for Real using
npm. This is how most real world Vue
projects are set up, and it unlocks a
whole new world of tools and features
that will make your development process
even smoother.
So far, we've been using Vue via a CDN,
which is a great way to get started
quickly. But in most real world Vue
projects, Vue is installed locally using
npm. And in this scrim, we're going to
take that next step and install Vue
locally using the official Vue project
scaffolding tool, create Vue. And we're
going to do it right here in the Scribba
interactive editor. This handy command
line tool does exactly what it says on
the tin. It spins up a view project
right where we want it. So here in the
editor, I'm going to type npm create
view at latest. Always include this at
latest to make sure you're using the
most upto-date version of create view.
Without it, MPM might actually resolve
to a cached or outdated version. Under
the hood, create View leverages Vit, a
fast and modern build tool to power both
the development server and the
production build. With create view, we
get a project preconfigured with VIT for
an efficient and enjoyable development
experience. If you want to learn more
about Vit, we do have an intro to V
course right here on Scriber. Back in
the terminal, we'll say yes to
installing create view by entering Y.
The command line will now ask us a few
questions to set up the project the way
we want it. First, it asks for a project
name. This is pretty self-explanatory.
What do you want to call your view
project? Create view will then create a
folder in the current directory with
this name and spin up your project
inside of it. We can also use just a dot
here if we want the project to be
scaffolded in the current directory. If
we do this, we will have to supply a
package name. So, we're going to call
this one my view project because I'm
super imaginative. The remaining prompts
are all about customizing the features
and tools you want included in your
project. Each option will either add
packages or configure settings that
extend the functionality of your
project. We won't select any of these
now, but I just wanted to show you how
customizable View can be even from the
setup process. We'll press enter to move
along and we'll also get a chance to
install any experimental features which
we won't at this stage. Once we've
answered all the prompts, create view
will go ahead and scaffold the view
project for us. Just like that, we can
see that there are a bunch of files and
folders that have appeared in our
current directory such as this
package.json. We can see a pretty
standard package.json here. We have the
allimportant view package listed as well
as Vit dependencies needed to get us
running. We can even see up here in the
scripts that vit is used to power
everything. Back to the terminal. Once
the project was created, create view
left us some instructions in the
terminal which is mpm install followed
by mpm rundev. So let's follow them.
First mpm install or mpm i. This
installs any and all dependencies listed
in package.json. Now this is actually
what will install Vue itself and any
extras that we may have specified. Now,
this may run for a little bit, so sit
tight and done. And now we can run the
other one, which is npm rundev. Now,
this starts the development server, and
we'll actually see Vue's starter project
pop up in this preview window. And just
like that, we have a Vue project set up
and ready to go. In the next Scrim, it's
your turn to give it a go to try and set
up a new Vue project.
In the last scrim, I walked you through
how to spin up a new Vue project. And in
this scrim, you're going to give it a go
yourself. This will probably be a quick
scrim, but it will be a good opportunity
for you to have a go rather than just
watching me do it. So, here is your
challenge, which I've already put here
in challenge.md.
Use create view to spin up a new Vue
project, then install and run it. Now,
if you choose to scaffold the project
into the current directory, which we did
in the last scrim, create view will ask
about removing everything in this
directory in order to do that. Since all
we have here is this challenge.md, feel
free to say yes.
This is how to do it. So, down here in
the terminal, we'll type mpm create view
at latest. For the project name, I'm
going to put a dot because I want it to
scaffold into this directory. The
current directory is not empty. Remove
existing files and continue. Yes, that
is totally fine. The package name will
be view project. And I will choose to
install none of the features and none of
the experimental features either. Next
up, I'm going to install with npm
install, which might take a while. Once
it's installed, we can run the app with
mpm rundev.
And there we go. In the next scrim,
we'll take a closer look at what create
view has spun up for us. We'll explore
the project structure, dive into the
files, and start understanding how
everything fits together. But for now,
take a moment to celebrate. You've just
set up your first view project like a
pro.
Now that we've set up our view project
using create view, let's take a look at
the project structure that it generated
for us. Now, I do know this might seem
like a lot to take in at first, but
don't worry. We'll learn about
everything in detail over the rest of
the course. For now, just think of it as
a quick tour of your view projects
anatomy. So, first, you'll notice that
create view has spun up a bunch of files
and directories. We're going to go
straight into the directory that you'll
be spending most of your time in, which
is this source folder. First, we have an
assets folder, which, as you can
imagine, would house your project's
assets. Inside of it, we can see some
CSS files as well as an SVG file. Pretty
standard assets. And then we have this
components folder where our components
will live. Now, don't worry. Components
are just chunks of code that will make
up your app's interface. We'll get into
that concept real soon in the next
section. And then moving down, we have
app.view. Now, this is the heart of your
application. It's the home of your Vue
project. At a glance, we can see some
JavaScript at the top between some
script tags. We've got some HTML in the
middle between some template tags and
then even some CSS down here inside of
style tags. We will learn about this
unique format very very soon. And then
we have main.js. This is a super simple
JavaScript file that links our HTML to
our Vue project. Some of the code here
might ring a bell. import create app
from view dotmount id app. We saw this
kind of logic a few scrims ago when we
were using the view CDN. Well, in an
installed view app, this is where that
logic sits. Okay, let's come out of the
source folder and into this index.html.
This is the HTML file that gets served
as the landing page of our website, just
like any other index.html file. For the
most part, you won't need to make any
changes here. Let's have a look. Down
here at the bottom, we have our script
tag, which imports the main.js file. And
just above that, we have our div with an
ID of app. This is where your entire
view app will be mounted. And then all
the way up here, we have your public
folder. This is where we'll put files
that we want exposed to the public as
is. For example, static assets like
favicon files. Now, let's step down here
to these four files under configuration.
These files make Vue work under the
hood. And if you've worked with other
frameworks or NodeJS, they should look
familiar. First, we have jsconfig.json.
This file determines which files should
be compiled when we build the project.
Here, we can see that everything in the
source folder is included and anything
in the node modules or disc folders are
excluded, which is pretty standard. Then
we have package.json and package
lock.json, which we've already talked
about. They list dependencies like Vue
and Vit and developer tools as well as
any scripts that you'll need to run or
build your project. And finally, we have
Vit.config.js.
Now, this file contains config settings
for Vit, which as you may remember is
the build tool that powers your project.
Here [snorts] we can see that Vue and
Vue dev tools have been imported and
then applied as plugins for Vit. If we
wanted to for example disable view dev
tools at the moment it's as easy as
commenting that line out or deleting the
line completely. Now we are going to do
that as we don't need view dev tools
just yet. And then down here we have
what's called an alias which we'll talk
about later in the course. For the most
part you won't need to work too heavily
with these config files but it's good to
know what they do and why they're here.
Again I know this might feel like a lot
to take in. This is a fairly fleshed out
starter project for a beginner, and it's
natural to feel a little overwhelmed at
first. But here's the good news. From
now on, I'll only include the files that
we need to focus on. That way, we can
break things down step by step and build
your understanding gradually. For now,
just remember, source is where you'll
spend most of your time building your
app. App.view is the main view file, and
index.html HTML is where the app will be
mounted to your HTML via main.js.
In the next scrimm, we'll do a quick
recap of everything we've covered in
this section. From setting up Vue to
exploring its anatomy, it's the perfect
way to reinforce what you've learned and
get ready for the exciting journey
ahead.
And that's it for this first section.
Let's take a moment to recap what we've
learned so far. We started by
introducing Vue, what it is, and why we
should learn and use it. Then we created
our first Vue app using a CDN, turning a
static HTML web page into a dynamic one.
After that, we installed Vue locally
using create Vue and got a fully set up
Vue project ready for development. And
finally, we explored the anatomy of that
project, breaking down its structure and
understanding the purpose of files and
folders in it. You've come a long way
already and you should be proud of what
you've accomplished. You've gone from
zero to having a fully functional Vue
project set up and ready to build on.
That's no small feat. And I just wanted
to let you know that it's perfectly
normal to feel a little overwhelmed at
this stage. Vue is a powerful framework
and learning it takes time and practice.
But here's the good news. You've already
taken the hardest step, which is to get
started. Every great developer started
where you are right now. And the key to
success is persistence. Keep practicing,
keep experimenting, and don't be afraid
to make mistakes. That's how you learn
and grow. In the next section, we're
going to dive into the fundamentals of
you. Think of this section as packing
for your adventure. And the next
section, you're going to go on it. Let's
keep this momentum going, and I will see
you in section two.
Hey there, and welcome to section two.
In this section, we're going to take
your view skills to the next level.
We'll build on what you've learned in
the previous section and dive into some
powerful view features that will make
your apps more dynamic and modular.
Here's what's on the menu for this
section. First, you'll learn how to
break your app into bite-sized logical
pieces with Vue components. And then,
we'll discover how to simplify your
import paths with the AT alias. Next up,
you'll learn about Vue's reactivity
system, which goes handinhand with Vue's
template syntax. And finally, we'll look
at how to use images and assets in Vue.
For our project this section, we're
going to build a very simple Vue fact
app. It's a one pager that features the
Vue logo and three facts about this
awesome framework. We'll work on this
project over three scrims, tackling a
new concept in each one as we go. But
between those scrims, we're going to
learn about these features of Vue so we
can use it. For each key concept that
we'll cover, here is the learning
process that we're going to follow.
First, I'm going to introduce each
concept in a simple and clear way so we
can understand the theory. And then
you'll see it in action with me showing
you the concept in context. And once
we've done that, you'll put your
understanding to the test by practicing
with a challenge. And finally, we will
apply what you've learned into the View
Facts app. This approach will help you
build confidence while seeing how
everything connects in a real project.
By the end of the section, not only will
you understand these concepts, but
you'll also see how they work in a real
project. Plus, you'll have a cool
Viewfax app to show off in your
portfolio. So, are you ready to level up
your Vue skills? Let's get coding.
We're going to kick off our fundamentals
with the core feature of Vue, the Vue
component. In Vue, everything starts
with a component. It's a special file
format that contains the HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript in one neat package. Let's
see it in action. In this Grim, I've set
up a fresh install of Vue using create
view. In the source folder, we've got
app.view and main.js, which is what
actually mounts our view app to the
HTML. We've also got main.css inside of
our assets folder. Let's head inside
app.view where most of our work will be
done in. And here we have the default
app.view file that create view
scaffolded for us. Late in the last
section, we had a very brief look at the
contents here. And now it's time to
really have a look. We can see that
there are three blocks. There's the
script section at the top, a template
section in the middle, as well as a
style section here at the bottom. To
make it even easier to look at, let's
get rid of all the content inside each
of these blocks. What we have left is
this skeleton of what's called a single
file component. This structure plus this
view file extension is a special file
format that allows us to work on the
template logic and styling of a view
component in one file. the classic trio
of HTML in the template, CSS in the
styles, and JavaScript in the script
section. Our core app.view file is in
itself a component. And that's why I
said earlier that in Vue everything
starts with a component, this component.
I'm going to drop in a bit of content.
And then I'm going to run the app with
mpm install and mpm rundev.
Does this look familiar? It should. This
is the one pager that we played around
back in the first section. I bet you
probably recognize some of the code
before I even ran the app. Back then, we
used a plain HTML file and a CDN to get
Vue working in our project. What you're
seeing now is the exact same project,
but implemented as a view component. To
make the comparison cleaner, here is
what the CDN versions JavaScript look
like. And down here is the JavaScript
that we need for a view component. Do
you notice how much cleaner and simpler
the view component version is? In the
HTML version, we had to use create app
and mount to initialize the view app.
And then we had to wrap everything in
the setup function and explicitly return
each of the variables. But in the view
component, all that boilerplate code is
handled for us. Here we just have to
import ref and then define our variables
which can then be used directly in the
template section. Like you can see down
here, all we have to do is include this
setup keyword within the script block up
here. Doing that essentially turns this
entire block into this setup function.
Now, moving down to the template. This
should look pretty much the same as the
original HTML. We've taken everything
from the body tag and popped it into the
template section instead. This means we
only have to concern ourselves with the
content and none of the metadata that we
would normally handle in the head
section. And of course down here we have
our style block. I had a lot of this in
a styles.css file in the original. Every
rule here is relevant to a HTML element
up here in the template. And it's much
easier for us to refer to while working
in this component. If I wanted to change
the styling of elements in the
component, I can do it right here rather
than waiting through a bunch of CSS in a
CSS file. So essentially everything that
you see here in the preview is being
determined by this single file component
right here. This app view. And now I'm
going to challenge you to have a play.
Your challenge is to make the copyright
year down here dynamic and blue. In the
script tag, you'll have to create a new
ref to house a different year. And you
can use the existing ones as a
reference. In template, you'll have to
change this static 2025 to render that
new variable that you've created. And to
do that, you can refer to how I've done
them here. And in the style section,
target the paragraph tag in the footer
and make it blue. Give it a go now. And
I'll see you on the other side.
First, I created a new variable and I
called it year. And then using the two
above it as a reference, I followed it
with ref function. And then I use 2014,
which is the year that Vue was first
publicly released. And then I'll render
it in the template using the same syntax
that I see for emoji and name. So
instead of 2025, I put in these curly
brackets. And inside of it, I referred
to year, which is what we created up
here. And then finally, down here in the
styles, I targeted the footers paragraph
tag and I made the color blue. And now
when I save, we can see that the change
has been made down here. So great work.
You've just met the view single file
component or the view file. It bundles
together your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
all in one neat little package. Now, if
that's making you raise an eyebrow, hold
on to that thought. We'll explore your
concerns in the next scrim.
At this point, you're probably thinking,
""Hang on, I thought we were supposed to
keep HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in
different files."" And you'd be right.
Separation of concerns is a key part of
writing well organized code. But let's
talk about what that actually means in
modern web development and how Vue
approaches it. That way of separating
file types made a lot of sense when
websites were simpler. But as apps have
gotten bigger and more dynamic, those
language-based files don't always help
anymore. In fact, they can get in the
way. Imagine this diagram with a ton
more files. Imagine how many arrows
there would be. This is what Vue states
on their own documentation. Separation
of concerns is not equal to the
separation of file types. In large
modern projects, splitting everything by
language can actually create more
confusion, not less. Vue takes a
different approach. Instead of
separating by language, it separates by
purpose. The component itself is the
concern. Each component does one thing.
For example, a component renders,
styles, and determines the interactivity
of, let's say, a footer. And all the
code it needs for that footer, the
template, logic, and styles, is kept
together. This makes your components
easier to read, test, reuse, and update.
So, while it might look like we're
mixing things up, we're actually making
our code easier to work with in the long
run. We're shifting from separating by
file type to separating by units of
functionality in our components. And
that mindset is a key part of building
large maintainable view applications. In
the next scrimm, we'll look at how to
build layout components to house headers
and footers, those familiar parts of a
page that help give your app its overall
shape.
In the last scrim, we talked about how
view components are all about
functionality, not just file types. And
now it's time to put that into action
and have a look at layout components.
Layout components or sometimes called
structural components can be headers,
footers, sidebars, etc. Essentially, the
elements that give your app its
structure and help shape the user's
experience. They don't usually have much
complex logic, but they play a big role
in how everything fits together. If we
have a look at a pretty standard HTML
structure, we can already see the UI in
logical pieces. There's a header, a
main, and a footer, but that just
handles the HTML. With view components,
we can compartmentalize the logic, the
styling, and the content for each of
these parts. Our file could actually
look more like this. Let's see it in
action. Here we've got our super simple
component from before. We can see in the
template that there are three distinct
layout sections. There's the header, the
main, and the footer. And each of these
can be abstracted away into its own
component and make our app doview
component super clean. Let me show you
this using the header and then you can
have a go at the main and footer
sections. So, first I'm going to come
over here to our source folder and
create a new folder called components.
And as the name suggests, this folder is
going to hold a bunch of view
components. Inside of it, I'm going to
create a new file called header.view.
The naming convention for a view
component is a capitalized word view.
And now we've got an empty header
component file. Remember, we're using
the single file component file format.
So, we'll need to supply the three
blocks of code for the script, template,
and styles. So, first the script, making
sure to include the setup keyword, and
then the template. And finally, the
styles, making sure to include the
scoped keyword. Now, the scoped keyword
is pretty self-explanatory. Everything
that you see here in the styles block is
scoped to only this specific component.
This makes it a lot easier to target
elements without having to specify a
bunch of parents just to target one
specific element. And now we've got that
very familiar component skeleton. Get
used to doing this. You'll be doing it a
lot throughout this course. Now I'm
going to pull out the relevant code to
create a header component from our
app.view file. First I'm going to pull
over any relevant JavaScript. The header
element down here uses this emoji
variable. So I'm going to grab that.
Come back here to header.view and I'm
going to paste it in the header. script
section. And since we're using this ref
function, we have to make sure to import
it. So import ref from view. Now we're
going to grab what goes inside of the
template section, which is the HTML. So
back in app.view, we're going to grab
the header in its entirety, and we'll
bring it back here to header.view and
pop it inside of the template tags. And
finally, the styles. Back in app.view1.
view. Once again, we're going to come
here to the style section and we're
going to grab the relevant styles for
header, which is just this one. And
again, we'll come back to header view
and we'll pop it in its style section.
I'm going to give header.view a save and
then come back to app.view and save this
one as well. The header content has now
disappeared from the preview. And that's
to be expected because there's no more
header related code in app.view. We now
need to import the header component and
use it. The import statement is pretty
straightforward. import header from at
components header doview. This first
header refers to the name of the
component. Earlier we named the file
header.view. Not only does this name the
file, but it also names the component.
So be sure to follow naming conventions.
And don't worry too much about this at
yet. We'll talk about it in the next
scrim. So, now that we've imported the
header component, we can use it. Down
here in the template section where we
took out the header content, let's pop
in header with a capital H and then a
self-closing tag. And now when we save,
we can see that the header has
reappeared in the preview. Now that I've
done the header component, it's your
turn to give it a go with the main and
footer elements of the template. You'll
just have to follow the same formula
that I did, which I've laid out in five
steps down here. So your challenge is to
separate the main and footer elements
into the main and footer components and
use them in app.view. Remember that you
can always refer to what I did with
header as well.
Here's how I went about turning the main
and footer elements into components. So
first in the components folder, I'll
create both files. So main doview as
well as footer.view.
And while I've got footer.view view
open. I'm going to type out this single
file component skeleton, which I'll
speed up for your sake. And now that
I've typed it once, I'm going to copy it
and paste it in main.view as well. And
since I've got main view open, let's
work on that first. Back in app.view,
I'm going to grab the main HTML and
bring it over here to main.view's
template section. And then I'll do the
same with the script section. Main.view
uses the name variable. So I'll head
over to app.view view and I'll grab the
name variable and bring it back to
main.view's script section. And since we
have to use ref, we'll make sure to
import it. import ref from view. And
then we'll fill out the style section.
So back in app.view, we'll come down to
the style section and find the two rules
relevant to main. We'll grab those and
we'll come back to main.view and we'll
pop it in its style section. Now that
main view is done, let's head to
footer.view. I'm going to grab the HTML
first. So, back in app.view, I'm going
to grab the footer section and bring it
into footer. Template section and then
do the same with the script section. And
we know that footer.view uses this
copyright year variable. So, back in
app.view, we'll come up and we'll find
the copyright year variable, grab it,
and bring it over into the script
section. And since we're using ref,
we'll make sure to import it. Import ref
from view. And finally, the styles. Back
in app.view, we'll come down and I'll
grab the last CSS rule, which is for the
footer and bring it over to footer.views
style section. And now both the main and
footer components are ready. So back in
app.view, I'm first going to clean up.
Now that I've given this a save, we can
see that we only have the header and the
preview. So let's import and use our
remaining components. Import main from
at components main.view view and import
footer from at components footer.view.
And then to use it, we'll do the same as
header. So main and footer. And since
we're not using ref anymore in this
script section, we can get rid of the
import statement. And now when we save,
everything is back to normal here in the
browser preview. And there we have it. A
clear app.view component and three child
components, header, main, and footer.
Each doing their own job. If we have a
look at header.view, you'll see that
it's doing exactly what it's supposed
to. It's defining what the header of the
app looks like, says, and does. Like I
said before, the component itself is the
concern. Everything the app needs for
the header component is right here. So,
what about app doview? Well, app.view
has a single purpose, too, and that's to
bring together all the pieces. It's the
top level component that lays out the
structure of the page by pulling in its
child components. And just like that,
we've got a clean and organized layout
built entirely from focused and
purposeful components. In the next
scrim, we're going to take a step back
from components and look at that at
character that we used when importing
our child components. What is that?
We'll find out in the next scrim.
We saw in the last scrim that we used
import statements to pull in the header,
main, and footer components into the app
component. We use this at character as
part of the file path, which is
something you may not have seen before.
You're probably more familiar with using
something like this instead. This dot
slash is a path indicator that you're
likely very familiar with. It means
start from the current directory and
then traverse from there. So,
technically, we can actually use the dot
here in our import statements instead of
at. In fact, let's do that. And then I'm
going to run the app and we'll check it
out. We can see that it absolutely still
works and that's because app.view sits
in the source directory and we can
navigate from here into components
pretty easily. This works very well
right now, but one day you're going to
have a very complicated app. So relative
traversing won't be much help then. So
I'd like to introduce you to the at
alias that's given to us by Vit, which
as you might remember is the build tool
that is utilized by create vit. Let's
come on down here to vit. doconfig.js,
JS which we had a quick look at in the
last section. This file essentially
tells V how to work with our view
project. There's quite a few things
happening here, but we're just going to
have a look at these three lines. This
part of the code sets up an alias or a
shortcut for our project. Specifically,
it tells Vit whenever you see this at
symbol in the code, replace it with the
absolute file path to the source folder.
This at is the alias. This new URL
section creates a URL to the source
folder of our project and this file URL
to path converts that URL into a file
path. So in a nutshell, the at alias
takes us back to the source folder from
wherever we are at and then we can
traverse from there. So back in the app
doview, let's do a tiny teeny challenge
for you to get used to the at character.
Use the at alias to import all
components. Super simple and you'll
probably do this in a matter of seconds.
So, go for it.
Let's amend all of these relative file
paths so they use the at alias instead.
First one, second one, and the third
one. And when we save, nothing has
changed. So, while it does do the exact
same thing for us right now, the at
alias will come into play later on when
we're linking and importing assets. So,
now that we've learned a bit about
components, how they're structured, and
how they fit together, let's apply some
of our newfound knowledge to a guided
challenge. We'll start that in the next
scrim. I'll see you there.
Welcome to part one of a guided
challenge. Here, I'll walk you through
the idea of view components in a more
real world setting, helping you get
comfortable with using a new concept in
context. Think of it as a mix between a
tutorial and a challenge. By the end of
this guided challenge, which is actually
next scrim, you'll be all set for your
first go at the section project, our
viewfax app. We start off with a
completely empty project. Well, almost
empty. Your first challenge, which is
here in challenge.md, is to spin up a
new view project using the create view
tool. See if you can remember how to
spin up a new view project.
All right, let's spin up a new view
project using the create view tool. Down
here in the terminal, let's type mpm
create view at latest. I will install
create view. Yes. And for the project
name, we wanted to scaffold to this
directory. So I'll just put a dot. Let's
remove the existing files with yes. Our
package name will be view project. And
we will skip any and all additional
features. And done. Now there are a few
tweaks for us to do in order to make
life easier for us, especially at this
point in our learning journey. So first
over here in vit.config, config. We're
going to remove any references to view
dev tools here and here. We won't be
needing that for a while and it might
actually get in the way. Up here in the
source folder, we're going to delete the
components folder. We'll be creating our
own anyway. In the assets folder, we're
going to delete base.css as well as the
SVG. And inside of main.css, we're going
to cut everything because we have our
own CSS. Then over to app.view, we'll
delete all the content inside of our
three blocks. And now we've got a very
basic view app ready for us to populate.
And we'll get ready for that by
installing it and running it. But what
are we populating this app with? For
this challenge, we're going to be
turning a plain HTML and CSS mockup into
a view app. I have just uploaded this
new folder called OG mockup. Inside of
it, you'll find index.html and
styles.css, as well as a picture of the
mockup. The mockup is pretty simple and
it doesn't work as expected yet. As a
Vue developer, you'll often be given
HTML and CSS mockups in order to turn
into a Vue app so it can be given the
required functionality. So, our job
right now is to bring over the relevant
code into the Vue app and split things
into structural components. To help us
out, I've already decided how we're
going to split this UI structurally. The
header up here, the main in the middle,
and the footer at the bottom. If we have
a look at the index.html, HTML file, we
can already see that the body is split
up this way. The header, the main, and
the footer. And if you have a look at
the mockup's CSS file, we can already
see that this is also split up into
those functional components. The header
CSS, the main CSS, and all the way down
here, the footer CSS. There is also this
base CSS section up the top, which we'll
talk about in a second. Okay, it's time
to give it a go. Your next challenge
should feel familiar to the last
challenge you had, except you have to
grab code from the mockup rather than
app.view. So over here in app.view, I'm
going to pop your challenge up here in
this script section. Create, populate,
import, and use the header component in
app.view. Make sure you grab the
relevant HTML and CSS from this mockup
folder.
This is how I went about it. First in
the source folder I created the
components folder and inside of it I
created header view. Then of course I
provided the single file component
structure of script template and style.
And I will speed through this one for
your sake. Now it's time to grab code
from our provided mockup. So first in
the mockups index.html I grabbed the
header and I popped it over here in
header.views template section. Then I
headed over to the mockups style.css the
CSS and I grabbed the header styles and
then of course popped it over here in
the header style section. Now that I
have that, I headed over to app.view to
import the header with import header
from components header doview. And then
I used it in the template with header
and then a closing tag. And now when I
save, you might not actually be able to
see it, but the words quote generator is
here in the preview. It's just very,
very light. And that's because a lot of
the core CSS is missing because we
haven't set the core CSS yet. But this
scrim is getting a little bit long. So
we'll handle that as well as our
remaining components in the next scrim.
In the last scrim part one of this
challenge, we handled the header
component. Now even though we have the
header handled, we can't actually really
see the header at all. And that's
because we haven't handled the base
styling. To do that, we're going to hop
on over here to the mockups style.css
file and have a look at this first
section where it says base CSS. We have
a couple of CSS rules which look like
we'll fix our styling issues. So, let's
grab these and pop them where we can't
just put them into app.view. I mean, we
can, but it's not going to do anything.
Style scoped means it will only be
applied to this specific component. This
selector will select everything here,
but that's just the header. And this
body selector has nothing to select. And
this app selector also doesn't have
anything to select. So let's get rid of
that. So where do we put it? Let's turn
our attention over here to main.js. This
is a file that we met at the end of the
last section. It's where our view app is
created and then mounted to the HTML,
but it's also where we're importing a
certain CSS file which lives in the
assets folder as main.css. And this is
where we're going to put our base CSS
styling. So, with that knowledge, I'm
going to challenge you to do it. Can you
apply the mockups base styles to the
view app?
Let's apply these base styles. So, over
here in the mockups style.css, we'll
grab the styles again, and this time
we'll head over here to source assets
main.css, and we'll pop it in here
instead. And now, when we save, we can
see that this is a lot closer to what
we're aiming for. Now that we've handled
the base CSS, we're going to move on to
the footer component, and we're going to
go straight into a challenge, one that
I'm sure you'll smash pretty quickly.
So, I'm going to drop your challenge
text here in app.view. You're going to
create, populate, import, and use the
footer component. You've done this kind
of thing a few times now, so it should
feel pretty comfortable. So, give it a
go and I'll see you in a bit.
Okay, let's get that footer component
happening. So over here in components,
let's create the new file and call it
footer.view. And of course, we have to
type out the single file component
skeleton, which I will do and speed up.
Man, I wish I typed that fast. Now, I'm
going to head into the mockups
index.html file and grab the footer
element. And then, of course, I'll put
it over here in footer.views template
section. And then I'll do the same with
the CSS. So, mockup CSS. all the way
down here at the bottom. We'll grab both
footer related CSS rules and we'll pop
it here in footer.views style section.
Now that the component is ready, let's
head back to app.view and we're going to
import footer from at components
footer.view and then we'll put it right
here after the header. And once we save,
we can see created by professor pickle
pop up in the preview. Easy peasy. Now,
there is one learning point that I want
to bring up here, and it's within the
footers style section. Our second rule
targets any span elements that are
children of footer elements. Now, this
definitely makes sense to do when we're
part of a larger CSS file. If we have a
look at the mockups CSS file again, we
can see that there's a span in the
footer, but also a span in the main
section. And they do look quite
different. So, of course, in our CSS
file, we'll want to specify the parent.
But in a contained component like our
footer, there is and will only be one
kind of span, which is this one. As
such, we can actually take away the
parent selector of footer and just leave
the span. And we can already see how
this can lead to very clean and readable
code. I mean, how many times have you
seen a crazy long CSS selector like
this? Of course, this won't actually
happen much. I'm really overexaggerating
here, but a long CSS selector like this
could be as simple as the second one
here at the bottom when in the context
of a component. Okay, back to our app.
Now that we've got the footer, it's time
to tackle the biggest and final part,
the main component. And here comes your
final challenge. Create, populate,
import, and use the main component. Take
advantage of scope styles and clean up
the CSS selectors as you see fit.
Let's go through those steps that you're
no doubt super familiar with by now. So
in components, we'll create main view
and we'll set up the single file
component skeleton. We have that now. So
I'm going to come over here to
index.html and grab the main section in
its entirety and pop it here in the
template section. And then of course
over here to styles.css for the CSS of
which there is quite a lot. So, make
sure you grab everything that is
relevant and then we'll pop it here in
the style scoped section. Now, there's a
lot of cleanup that we can do here. Not
this one because this one is the
selector, but we can clean up every
single other main that is here.
And now our main component is ready to
import. So, back in app.view, we're
going to import main from components
main doview. And down here, we'll
squeeze it in between header and footer.
And there we go. It's looking great, and
the preview looks just like the mockup.
So, your first guided challenge is now
complete. You've created a view app from
scratch using create view. We've also
tweaked the Vit settings to remove Vue
dev tools and clean up files and code
that we don't need. You've also created
and used three components based on a
HTML and CSS mockup. and you've cleaned
up the CSS to take advantage of scoped
styles. Most of these things you'll need
to do for the upcoming scrim where
you're going to start our section 2
project. So, take a quick break, pat
yourself on the back, and I'll see you
there.
Welcome to your section 2 project. This
is the View Fax app. Just like with your
last challenge, you'll be given a HTML
and CSS mockup to turn into a Vue app.
Here in the editor, I've already set up
the view project, disabled view dev
tools, and pulled the codebase down to
the bare necessities. Up here in the OG
Viewfax folder, I've provided the
mockups HTML CSS as well as a reference
image for you. Now, you will notice that
I have provided the view logo image file
as well, but we won't be needing this
until much later in the section. In
fact, if we have a look at the HTML, you
can see that I've commented out the
image tag, and that's because it will
very likely break the app until we learn
how to handle images properly. This is
the first of three scrims for this
project. We're going to work on simply
splitting the mockup into logical
components, just like what we've done so
far in the section. The layout and
content of the mockup may differ
slightly from what you've seen before,
but try to think logically and work
through it. After all, in the real
world, not everything will be as
clear-cut as these challenges. So, back
in the editor, let's close this up, and
I will take you to app.view where I'm
going to drop your challenge text. Turn
the provided HTML and CSS mockup into a
view app that uses three components. And
make sure you use all the provided CSS.
Remember that you can always refer back
to previous scrims to go over what we
did. So, I will see you on the other
side with the solution.
So, first I'm going to run the app with
mpm install and mpm rundev so we can see
ourselves working in it in real time.
Then I'm going to create our components
folder here in the source directory. So
components and inside of it I'm going to
create our three component files
starting with header main and finally
footer.
And now that I've typed that once I'm
going to copy and paste it into the
others into header and into main. Then
I'm going to pull over all the HTML. So
over here in the viewfax index.html
file, I'm going to pull over first the
header into the header template and then
the entire main section which is quite
large into the main template section.
And then back in index.html, I will grab
the footer section and pop it into the
footer template area. Then I'm going to
do the same with the CSS. So I'll close
up the HTML and open up the CSS. And
scrolling down, I will find the header
CSS section. I'll grab all of these and
pop it into the header style scoped
section. And I will clean up these
parent selectors because we don't need
them thanks to the script keyword. Next
up is the main CSS. We'll grab all of
these and pop them into the main CSS
scope section. And I will get rid of
this main, this main, and this main
parent selectors. And then finally down
here, we'll grab the footer CSS and pop
it over here in the footer style
section. And I'll get rid of this footer
parent selector. Okay, now that our
components are ready, we can come back
to app.view and import them. So import
header from at components header.view.
Same thing with the main from at
components main.view. and then import
footer from at components, footer.view.
Then we can use them in the template. So
header first, main second, and footer
last. And now when we save, we can see
that the content is there, but we're
missing the base CSS. So here in this
CSS file, we will grab the entire base
CSS section to this span. And then we'll
pop this in source assets main.css.
And now when we save, we can see that
our app is looking just like the mockup
minus the logo, which we know that we've
commented out at this stage. So nice
job. You've made a fantastic start to
the section 2 project. You've taken a
plain HTML and CSS mockup and you split
it into structural components in a brand
new Vue app. We're off to a great start
and now it's time to learn a bit more
about Vue foundations so we can add even
more to this project. Next up, we're
going to dig into another very core
feature of Vue, which is reactivity.
I'll see you there.
Welcome back from dipping your toes into
our section 2 project. You've done the
first step in that project and now we're
going to learn something new,
reactivity. Now, the word reactivity or
reactive is something you might have
heard a few times already. And this ref
function should also look familiar.
You've already counted a bit of
reactivity and ref in section one, but
now we're really going to dig in. First,
what is a reactive state? When something
is made reactive in Vue, like a
variable, Vue watches it. If the value
of a reactive variable changes, like
this, Vue will automatically rerender
parts of the UI as needed. Vue's
reactivity system is what makes it feel
so live and automatic. You don't need to
write code to manually update the DOM.
Vue does that for you as long as this
variable has reactive state. And to
create reactive state for a variable, we
use the ref function which you have seen
a few times now. We declare a constant
using const. We name the variable as
usual. And then we wrap our intended
value with the ref function. And now
this name variable is reactive. Let's
see it in action. Here we've got a
pretty familiar view app which I'm going
to run so we can see it. This is the
quote generator we worked on earlier.
There are a few elements in this app
that would definitely benefit from
reactive state and that is the quote as
well as the author of the quote. In a
more developed version of this app, we
might be pulling in data from an array
or an external source like an API. So,
our review app should expect that
functionality in the future. Let's head
into the main component where the quote
and the author are housed. And now it's
time to utilize this script section.
This is where we set up our reactive
variables. So first, because we're going
to be using ref, we have to import it.
So import ref from view. And then I can
use it to create a reactive variable for
the quote. So const quote equals ref.
And I'm just going to copy and paste
what we have at the moment. This quote
variable is now what we call a ref
object. This is a special object that
helps view keep track of the reactive
states in the app. These are often
called refs. So if you hear me say
something like the quote ref, you'll
know that I'm referring to a variable
that has been made reactive using the
ref function. Okay, it's your turn to
give it a go. Here is a mini oneliner
challenge. Create a reactive variable to
house the author, John Johnson. This is
just a quick one. You can basically do
exactly what I did up here, but with the
author instead.
const author equals ref John Johnson.
Pretty easy. Now, for the sake of
practice, let's see what else we can
make reactive. Over here in the footer
component, we have the copyright year.
While this isn't going to change much,
it would certainly change based on the
current year. So, this is a good
contender here. And then over here in
the header.view component, we've only
got the quote generator heading. Now,
this probably won't change much in a
real app setting, but let's get some
practice in anyway. I'm going to pop
your challenge over here in the header
component, which is to create a reactive
variable to house the heading here. And
then in footer.view, you'll do the same
to house the current year.
Let's create some refs. So, here in
header.view, I'm going to first import
ref so we can use it. Then, let's create
a new variable. I'm going to call it
title and then we'll use ref and we'll
just call it the same thing as it is
right now. Quote generator and then in
footer.view we're going to do the same
thing starting with importing ref from
view and then we'll create the year
variable. So const year equals ref and
we'll do the same thing right now 2025.
Great. We've set up some refs or
reactive variables. But now what? You
might remember from section one what we
have to do now to get these to render in
our template. And you're welcome to give
it a go after the scrim has ended. But
we will have a look at that properly in
the next scrim. So I will see you there.
We're going to have a look at something
called template syntax in the scrim,
specifically text interpolation. We've
got our reactive variables here in our
little quote generator app. like this
year. Vue is now watching these
variables, but we now need Vue to
actually render them to the page. Let's
get set up by running the app with mpm
install and mpm rundev. Vue uses a
HTMLbased syntax that lets us bind data
such as refs in our components to
certain elements of the DOM. You've
actually already seen text interpolation
in action back in section one with this
mustache syntax. This is how we can
render a ref that we've specified in our
component. Let's see it in action. We're
going to head on over here to the header
component. We've got a title ref here
with the value of quote generator. It's
a little different from the hard-coded
heading that we have down here, which
has a lowercase G. In order to use our
title ref in the template section, all
we have to do is specify the ref name
wrapped in curly brackets. So, instead
of quote generator being hardcoded,
we're going to pop in some mustache
syntax and we're going to type in title.
Now when we save, we can see that our
title ref is being used. We can see the
capital G this time. And to make it
super super obvious, let's change this
to something completely different like
programming quotes. And we can see that
it has changed. Now the way that I just
changed this variable's value like this
isn't how we would actually do something
programmatically in a real app setting.
In a real app, we would actually be
tapping into the value property of the
title ref. Title do value equals
programming quotes. And we'll change
this back to what it was before, which
was quote generator. Because title is
technically a ref object, we have to
specify the dot value property in order
to actually change its value. But it's
just title down here in the template.
What gives? Well, Vue automatically
unwraps the dot value property for us
when we use refs inside of the template.
So, while we have to write title value
up here in our JavaScript code, we can
just write title in the template and Vue
knows to display the inner value. This
makes our templates a lot cleaner and a
lot easier to read without needing to
worry about adding dot value all over
the place. All right, now it's over to
you. There are a few refs that we
created in the last section that we can
render in their components template
section. There is one here in footer and
there's two here in main.view. So here
is your challenge which I will pop here
in main.view. Render the quote and
author refs in the template and then in
footer. Do the same with the year ref
and then change the value of each ref
using dot value.
Let's render some refs here in the main
component. Let's get rid of this
hard-coded quote. And then we'll replace
it with mustache syntax and quote. And
you can see a very slight difference
because the full stop has disappeared.
And then instead of the hard-coded John
Johnson, let's do some mustache syntax.
And then here we'll use author. Next is
to change the property of each ref. So
quote do value, I changed this to it's a
feature, not a bug. And then for author
value, I change this to unknown.
Then let's do the same over here in the
footer. So instead of this hard-coded
2025, we're going to pop in some
mustache syntax and then refer to the
year ref. And then up here after year
has been created, we're going to target
it and its value. And we'll change this
to 2014, which is the year that Vue was
publicly released. And there we go. One
quick note here. Even though we've only
used strings for our refs, we can
actually use a whole bunch of types.
Strings, booleans, numbers, and arrays,
just to name a few. Just make sure
you're using quotation marks when you
need, especially for strings. And just
like that, our app is starting to feel a
lot more dynamic and reactive. Thanks to
refs, we're now using reactive state and
text interpolation to render data that
updates in real time. Instead of hard-
coding content, we're letting Vue handle
changes behind the scenes, and our
template reflects those changes
instantly. Now, text interpolation is
only one of many ways to bind component
data to the component template. We're
going to check out another method in the
next scrim. I'll see you there.
So far, we've only seen text
interpolation used to bind refs to
elements in the template, but there are
cases where the mustache syntax can't be
used at all. And one such instance is
when we need to dynamically populate a
HTML attribute value. So for example,
I'm going to create a new ref that holds
a link const href equals ref. And here
I'm just going to paste in the scriber
URL. And then I'm going to set up some
anchor tags around this span element
down here. So anchor tag mthref for now.
And then we'll make sure to close it as
well. Now you might think that we can
just pop some text interpolation here.
and the value of the href attribute like
this. But this would actually just set
up an anchor tag with the href attribute
of bracket bracket href bracket bracket.
And that's not what we want at all. And
that is where attribute bindings come
into play. This helps us as the name
suggests bind data to HTML attributes.
In our case, we want to bind this href
ref to the href attribute of our new
anchor tag. Vue gives us what's called
the vbind directive. It's something we
can attach to HTML attributes when we
want Vue to take control of them.
Instead of treating the attribute as
plain static text, Vue steps in and does
a bit of magic. What sort of magic?
Let's have a look. So, first we're going
to get rid of this because it's not
correct anyway. Then we're going to
prepend this v-bind colon to this href
attribute. Now, this href attribute is
data bound. But data bound to what?
Well, it will be data bound to whatever
we specify as the value here. We want to
use this href ref that we created up
here. So, all we have to do is to
provide href as the value of this href
attribute. And that's it. We can see
that the anchor tag down here is
definitely in play because of that
default blue styling. And speaking of
the default blue styling, it's not very
nice. So, I'm going to quickly fix this
up. Down here in the styles, I'm going
to add a new rule, anchor tags, and I'm
going to make them all white. And that
feels much better. That was a bit of a
tangent, but did you see how quick that
was? We didn't have to go into an
external CSS file, find the footer
styles, and then add to it. Thanks to
scope styles, we were able to do that
right here. Super quick. Over here in
main.view, we're going to add another
link. We would potentially want users to
be able to click out to the source of
the quote that they're seeing. So
perhaps the author over here could be an
anchor tag as well. So here is your
challenge up here in the script section.
Turn the static author name into a
dynamic link. And to do that I've given
you four steps.
Let's link up this author. So first up
here I created the ref. I called it
const href equals ref and I used the
Wikipedia link that I provided. And then
I came down to the span tag and I
wrapped it in anchor tags a href and
then of course to close it with a. Then
I used vbind to bind to this href
attribute. So vbind colon and as the
value I provided the href ref with just
href. And now we can see that something
has happened. Unknown is definitely a
link already because we can see the
default blue underline, but the styling
has gone a little bit funny and that's
because we now have this a tag as a
child of the section rather than the
span tag. Let's fix that really quickly.
Coming down here to the CSS, the fastest
way I could find to do this was to add
to this span. I just added an anchor
selector. But you could have approached
it completely differently, such as the
joy of CSS. And there we go. We've
learned about attribute bindings and
used its syntax, the Vbind to do it.
Now, Vbind is only one of many view
directives that exist. We'll talk about
directives a little more later in the
course, but just know you've learned
your first one, so hats off to you. Next
up, I'm going to introduce you to a few
more fun things about Vbind to make your
dev life a little more streamlined. I'll
catch you there.
So, we've just learned how to bind
attributes using Vbind, but there are a
few more fun things to know about Vbind.
Here we have our quote generator app
again, but I've made a few tiny changes
to get it ready for what we're about to
learn. Over here, I've added another
button to share the quote, and I fixed
up the structure a little bit, as well
as add some styling. The first extra
thing to know about Vbind is that it
works with boolean attributes.
attributes like disabled for example as
long as the value of the ref that we're
feeding it is a boolean it will action
accordingly in the case down here the
disabled attribute will be false and
therefore the button will not be
disabled let's actually see it in action
as I said earlier we have two buttons
now and one of them is to share the
quote well that's definitely not ready
right now so let's disable it by using a
ref and attribute binding so up here in
the JavaScript I'm going to create a new
ref const is button disabled equals ref
and true. Now here I made sure not to
use quotation marks so that this value
is a boolean and then I can bind it to
the share button like this. Bb bind
colon disabled equals is button
disabled. And now you can see the button
is disabled. Now just a quick note I did
come down here and add some disabled CSS
and that's why it's showing up gray and
a little bit faded. You can give it a go
now with the other button. Here is your
super straightforward challenge. Use the
is button disabled ref to disable the
another button.
Let's do it. It's exactly the same as
what we did for the share button, but
the is button disabled ref has already
been created. So, we just have to come
straight down here to the button and add
vbind colon disabled equals is button
disabled. Easy peasy. The other super
cool thing about vbind and most other
directors that you'll come across is
that they have shorthands. Instead of
using vbind colon, we can actually just
use colon. Think of all the time you'll
save by skipping those six characters
all throughout your project. So, over
here in footer.view view where we have
our vbind colon href. This can literally
just be colon href and it will do the
exact same thing. Back here in main
view, I'm going to give you a challenge
to clean up some of the vbinds that we
have here. Use vbinds shorthand wherever
possible. There are a couple of places,
so see if you can find them all.
Okay, let's do it. There are three
Vbinds here that we can shorten to use
the shortand. So, Vbind here, we'll get
rid of it. Vbind here. And also Vbind
here. And there we go. Look how much
cleaner our code is. Now, and if you
think that was cool, wait till you see
the next one. If your attribute name is
the same as the value that you're
passing it, like in this example, you
can remove the equal sign and value
completely. You can just use colon href.
This is aptly named the same name
shorthand. So for example, our href here
that links out to the source of the
quote, we're binding the href attribute
with the ref called href. So this whole
attribute binding situation can just be
shorthanded to just colon href. And this
will still work just as well. And now
it's your turn to give it a go over here
in footer. Here we also have a href
attribute that is bound to a href ref.
So, can you use the same name shortand
to shorten the href attribute binding?
Let's do it. We're going to grab
everything past this equal sign and
leave just colon href. And now you know
you've got a solid handle on vbind, its
short hands, and even a neat trick for
when the attribute name matches the ref.
In the next grim, we're going to pull
together everything you've learned so
far about reactivity and template syntax
and start building it into our section 2
project. I'll see you there.
Welcome back to the section 2 project,
our view facts app. In this scrim,
you'll tackle the second part of the
project, which is reactivity and
template syntax. You're going to pull
together everything you've learned about
reactivity, reactive state, refs, text
interpolation, and attribute bindings to
take this project to the next stage.
You'll have a few challenges to work
through in this scrim. Let's start with
the footer component. We need to create
a ref that houses this hard-coded URL
and then use that ref instead of this
hard-coded URL. So, here is your
challenge text. Create a ref to house
the view website and then bind the ref
to our anchor tags href attribute and
use shortands if you can.
First we're going to have to import ref
from view so that we can use it and then
we can create one. I'm going to call it
href and have it equals to ref and then
the view website. And now that I have
it, we're going to bind it to our anchor
tags href attribute. So instead of the
hard-coded URL here, I'm going to
provide href, which is the name of the
ref. And then of course, I'll have to
bind it with vbind colon. And now we can
see that there's a few opportunities to
shorthand. First, we can shorthand vbind
colon to just colon. And then because
the name of the attribute and the name
of the ref are the same, we can remove
everything past this equal sign as well,
leaving just colon href. Great job.
Let's move into main.view view for your
second challenge. Here we have three
section elements that each render a
different view fact. Each one has a H2
that contains an adjective and then a
paragraph element containing a short
description of that adjective. There is
a lot of variable content for us to play
with. For this challenge, I want to push
you a little bit and ask you to try
something that we haven't covered, but
it is a combination of your existing
JavaScript knowledge and view. Let's see
if you can figure out how to use an
array of objects as a ref. Your
challenge is to create a reactive array
of objects to house the view facts. Each
object might have an adjective property
and a description property. This is
almost exactly the same way that you
would create an array of objects in
vanilla JavaScript, but here you'll just
have to wrap it in the ref function.
Give it a go.
Okay, so just like always, let's import
ref from view so we can use it. And now
we can use it to create this new
reactive array of objects. And I'm going
to call it fax and then start the ref
function. Now I know that it's going to
be an array. So I'll pop that in first.
I also know that each array element is
going to be an object. So I'll create
one object first. The first property is
going to be adjective and I'll leave it
blank for now. And the second one is
going to be description. And again, I'll
leave it blank for now. I also know that
there's only going to be three of them.
So, I'm going to preemptively create
three of these matching objects. And
then I'm going to grab this hard-coded
data and pop it into the fax ref. So,
first lightweight and its description,
and then approachable, and then its
description, and then finally versatile,
and then its description.
Like I said before, this is just like
creating a vanilla array of objects. The
only difference is that we wrapped it in
Vue's ref function to make it reactive.
Now, all we have left to do is bind the
data from up here to the elements in our
array down here. For this, you will have
to draw upon your existing knowledge of
JavaScript arrays and objects and then
combine it with our new knowledge of
text interpolation using the mustache
syntax. So, here is your final
challenge. bind the data from the fax
ref to elements in the template.
Remember that fax is an array and each
element of that array is an object with
properties.
How did you go marrying up your existing
JavaScript knowledge with new view
knowledge? Here's how we can go about
it. So, I'm going to start with this
lightweight adjective. Instead of the
hard-coded lightweight, I'm going to pop
in some mustache syntax. And then I
started off with the ref itself which is
facts. I want to target the first
element of the array. So I popped in the
square brackets and inside of it index
zero. Now that I'm in the index zero
object, I want to grab the adjective
property. So I just popped in dot
adjective. And then we just have to do a
very very similar thing for the
description. So first the mustache
syntax and we want facts and the element
at index zero. and then we're targeting
the description property. Now, you're
not going to see a difference over here
in the preview because we've just used
exactly the same content as the
hard-coded version. But now, we're going
to see something in action. I'm now
going to delete the second and third
sections and leave only the first. And
then I'm going to copy and paste this
section twice. And now we can see that
this text interpolation is definitely
working. And now it's just a matter of
changing the indices of this second and
third one. So the second one should be
index one and index one. And the third
one is index two and index two. And
there we go. Now some of you might be
thinking, wait, there's there's a more
streamline way of doing this, right?
What's with all the copying and pasting?
And you'd be absolutely right. But hold
your horses. We'll get to that in a
later section. All in good time. But
nice work. Your developer senses are
definitely tingling. We've now split the
app into logical components and played
around with reactive state text
interpolation and attribute binding. In
a real app, this kind of data would
probably come from an external source
like an API. So, it makes sense to
practice how to get that data from your
JavaScript into the rendered HTML.
There's just one thing left to do before
our project really matches the mockup,
and that's adding the image. The next
few scrims will focus on how to work
with images in Vue. And then we'll wrap
up the section by bringing the Vue logo
into the project.
What is a web app without images? Even
the simplest of apps has an image
somewhere, whether it's a little logo or
a feature image. There are actually a
few ways to work with images and assets
in Vue, and they're all valid methods
depending on the complexity of your
usage. The first method is to use an
absolute path to reference a file in the
public folder. A view project's public
folder is a special directory for static
assets. These files are served to the
client as is, meaning they don't go
through V's bundling process and don't
get optimized. Any file in the public
folder can be accessed directly via the
root/ URL. Here I've got a small view
app that's designed to display images.
There are three sections and each will
house two images. one that I'll hook up
and the other that you'll hook up. We're
going to start in this first section
where it says absolute path to public
folder to showcase the absolute path to
the public folder. I'm going to create
an empty image tag. So image source and
we'll leave it blank for now. And then
also alt and we'll leave it blank for
now. Now let's check out what's in the
public folder. We've got a folder called
images and then inside of it we have two
JPEGs. There's cat meme 1 a and cat meme
1b. Let's use the first one. This a back
to our image tag. We're going to link it
directly to the source in the public
folder like this. / slash to take us to
the public folder. Images to take us
into that folder. And then we'll target
the image name. So, cat meme 1 a.jpeg.
And there we have our first image
straight out of the public folder. Okay,
it's your turn to give it a go with the
other image that we have in that folder.
Use an image tag to display cat 1b.jpeg
JPEG located in the public folder.
All right, let's do exactly the same
thing as before, but now using the B
image. Say image source slash to take us
to the public folder. Images to take us
into that folder and then cat meme
1B.jpeg.
And we'll do an empty alt for now. And
there it is. The next way is to use a
relative path to the assets folder. It's
pretty similar to the first method, but
we're using the assets folder instead.
You might remember from previous scrims
or even this one that there is an assets
folder that sits inside of our source
folder right here. This is where our
main.css is living. And it's also where
other assets like images can live as
well. To get here, we can use the super
duper dandy at alias to take us to the
source folder and then into the assets
folder. I'm going to get rid of this
challenge text and we can move on down
to this second section where it says
relative path to the assets folder. Just
like before, let's create an empty image
tag with an empty source and an empty
alt. And now let's check out that assets
folder to see what we have. We've got an
images folder that holds cat meme 2A,
cat meme 2B, cat meme 3, and cat meme
3B. We're going to use cat meme 2A for
this example. So over here in source,
we're going to use the at@ alias to take
us to the source folder and then into
assets and then into images. And we're
going to use cat meme 2_.jpeg.
And there we have half of our second cat
meme. And now it's up to you to get that
second half up. Use an image tag to
display cat meme2b.jpeg located in the
source assets folder.
Okay, let's finish this meme with image
source. We'll start with the at alias to
take us to the source folder and then
into the assets folder into the images
folder and then we'll target cat meme
2B.jpeg
with an empty alt for now. And there he
is in all his glory. The third method
that we'll look at in this scrim is to
import the asset into the component and
then use it via attribute binding. This
method involves importing it from the
assets folder and then binding it to an
images source attribute. In this final
section here where it says import asset
into component, I'm going to once again
start with an empty image tag. Image
source empty and alt empty. But now I'm
going to head up to the script section
and I'm going to import our image
specifically cat meme 3A. So, import cat
meme 3A from assets images cat meme3
a.jpeg. Now, we can name this import
whatever we want. But this name makes
sense. And now we can come down to our
image tag and bind our import to the
source property. So, first I'm going to
bind with vbind colon and then the
source is cat meme 3 a referring to this
import up here. And there it is. You can
probably guess what's coming next. It is
your turn to finish this very
recognizable cat meme. At least I hope
it's recognizable. I'm not old, am I?
Import cat meme 3B into the component
and then use an image tag and attribute
binding to display it.
Let's do it. I'm going to first come up
here and import the image first. So,
import catamme 3b from at assets images
cat meme 3b.jpeg.
And then I'm going to come back down
here and I'm going to write everything
in one go with image vbind source equals
cat meme 3b with an empty alt. And there
it is. Of course, we can make use of the
vbind shorthand by removing this vbind
completely and leaving just colon
source. And if the import did have the
same name as the attribute, which is
source, let's change it just to see that
in action. We can remove everything past
this, leaving just colon source. At the
end of the day, the method you choose
depends on your project's needs and the
conditions you're working with. Each
approach has its strengths and
trade-offs, so there's no oneizefits-all
solution. Here's a quick table to help
you decide. Feel free to take a quick
screenshot if you want it for future
reference. In the next Grim, we're going
to have a bit of a play around with
these three methods and which one you
should use in different situations.
It's time to put what you've learned in
the last scrim into practice. In this
challenge, you'll be working with images
in a view project using the three
methods that we just explored. Here is
that same table from the end of the last
scrim for reference. And just a quick
note, there are actually more ways to
work with assets and images in Vue, and
these are just the first three to get
you started. Also, keep in mind that
this table is meant as a general guide,
not a rule book. You might find that one
method works better for your particular
situation. So, here is your challenge.
I've set up a single page from an
ecommerce site. Over here in OG assets,
I've provided three images as well as a
mockup of what the final app should look
like. This header logo up here is
logo.png. This product image is product
image.jpeg. And down here we have a
white version of the logo called logo
footer 35 pixels.png.
We can see from the preview that there
are no images involved just yet. And
that is your challenge for this scrim.
Over here in header, I've marked out
where you'll have to pop in an image tag
for the logo. And same goes for
main.view where I would like you to put
the product image. And of course down
here in footer.view I've marked out
where I would like that white version of
the logo. Here I've got a file called
challenge.mmarkdown where I've popped
the entire challenge as a quick
reference. And speaking of reference,
I've also put a quick reminder of the
best use cases of the three methods that
we learned in the last scrim. So good
luck and I'll catch you on the other
side.
How did you go with this slightly larger
challenge? Here's how I would have gone
about it. But again, remember the best
use cases are general. You might have
made different choices and that's okay.
At the end of the day, it really depends
on your project and your context. So,
first the logo here in header.view. This
is a relatively small asset and it's
used in the header. It's already quite
small in size and because there's only
one of them, I don't need it to be
optimized by VIT. So, I'm going to use a
relative link to the assets folder for
this one. So, first I'm going to move
logo.png into the assets folder. Then
here, I'm going to create that image
tag. So, image source. And to get to the
assets folder, we'll use the at alias
and then into assets and then logo.png.
And for the alt, we'll call it logo.
Next, I handled the product image over
here in main.view. Now, in the full
context of the app, there will be
multiple product images, and we might
need them to load dynamically. So, for
this one, I'm going to practice
importing the asset into the component.
So, just like before, I moved product
image.jpeg into the assets folder. And
then up here in the script section, I
imported it and I called it source from
at assets product image.jpeg.
And then of course I'll bind it to an
image tags source attribute. So image
vbind source equals we've called it
source up here alt catbox. And you can
probably see that there are a few
shortands that we can use here. We can
shorten vbind colon to just colon. And
because source matches source, we can
get rid of everything past this equal
sign. And finally, the footer logo here
in footer.view. Now, this one's
definitely a contender for a relative
link to the assets folder, but we
haven't tried the public method yet. So,
we're going to do that here. So, first
I'll move logo footer 35 pixels to the
public folder. And then I'm going to use
it in an image tag. So, image source
slash to get straight into the public
folder. and then logo footer 35
pixels.png.
And for the alt, we'll call it white
logo. And if you scroll down in the
preview down to the footer, you'll see
it there. And there we have it. You've
just tried your hand at the three
methods of handling images or assets.
You've made a conscious decision
regarding which method to use, and now
you have another tool on your belt.
We've only got a few scrims left, and
next up, we're going to finalize our
section 2 project by adding that final
image. I'll see you there.
Welcome back to the section 2 project.
We're very, very close to completing it.
There's just one more thing to go. As
you can probably guess by now, we'll be
tackling the third and final challenge
of this project, which is the image.
Over here in the header component, we're
going to finally tackle this commented
out bit of code. Now, based on your
understanding of this super simple
project, which method of using images
would you use? Now the logo file is
available here in the OG viewfax folder
under logo view 300 pixels. Grab it and
place it wherever you see fit and using
your preferred method of working with
images get the logo showing. So I'm
going to get rid of this and replace it
with your challenge text which is to
render the view logo. This will be your
last challenge for this entire section.
So make it a good one and I'll see you
on the other side.
How did you go and what method did you
pick? Let's pop in an empty image tag
for now. Image source empty and alt view
logo. Now, your solution could have been
to use a relative path to the assets
folder because of the simple nature of
this project. The logo is very static
and only used in one place and doesn't
change. So you could have placed the
logo in the assets folder like this and
then linked to it using a relative path
like this at assets logo view 300
pixels.png. And there it is. You could
also say that the image is already
optimized because we can see that it is
300 pixels and there's only one image
across the entire project. So you might
have gone with using the public folder
and linked directly to it like this. So,
we'll move this to the public folder and
then we'll change this to just / logo
view 300 pixels. And there it still is.
Or you could have thought that even if
it's a small project, you want the image
to be imported and optimized. Or you
just wanted to practice what you know
was still coming in later sections. So,
you could have imported the image. So,
I'm going to move the logo back into the
assets folder. And then up here in the
script section, I'm going to import it
from there. say import source from at
assets logo view 300 pixels.png and then
we would have bound it to the image. So
instead of all of this it's just going
to be source with a vbind before that.
And of course we can use all the
shortands known to man and get rid of
the vbind as well as the reference to
source because the attribute is the
same. No matter what way you choose,
these are all valid methods for
different kinds of projects. As long as
you're familiar with all three, you have
all the tools you need on your tool
belt. And with that, our first Vue
project is complete. We have a very
simple view app that displays three
facts about Vue. It uses a parent
component app.view that imports three
child components that make up the entire
UI. Each component has separate logic,
styling, and template from other
components to keep the concerns
separated where the concern is the
component itself. This project uses two
different ways to bind data from the
components logic to the components
template. Here in main.view, we've used
text interpolation. And here in
header.view, we've used attribute
binding. And it uses one of three
different ways to work with images in a
Vue project. Very well done.
And that's it for this section. Give
yourself a huge pat on the back. Let's
take a moment to recap what you've
learned so far. You've learned how to
break your app into bite-sized logical
pieces with Vue components. And we've
discovered how to simplify import paths
with the AT alias. You've also learned
about Vue's reactivity system, which
went handinhand with Vue's template
syntax. And finally, we looked at how to
use images and assets in Vue. Not only
that, but you've also built your very
first Vue app, which is our Vue Fax app.
How good is that? Getting all of this
under your belt means you're well on
your way to becoming confident with Vue.
Might have felt like a lot at times, but
every bit that you've tackled here is
laying a strong foundation for what's to
come. In the next section, we're going
to start making our view apps smarter,
passing data around, responding to user
input, and showing just the right things
at just the right time. I will see you
there."

these are decisions that all being made
and we code this together. So, I mean,
it's kind of a shame cuz so much time
goes into these and for someone to go
like, ""Oh, it's just AI."" I'm just like,
""Yeah.""
>> Yeah.
>> But it's not. The only time I did use
the I'm going to be 100% honest was to
do the kind of sample data. With any
kind of stuff like this, we do use kind
of sample data. So, for example, in this
one, we used furniture and we used I
essentially used AI to come up with
furniture for me. So, before it would
take me ages. I be like, I have to think
of the name for this table. I have to
think of a price. I have to think of a
description. I have to find an image
somewhere. No, like that would take me
like 6 hours minimum. Now I just kind of
use AI to create that JSON file for me,
which is such a huge timesaver."

podcast. I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and
founder of freecodeamp.org.
And today we're talking with Abby
Perini, who taught herself programming
at age 27 and maintains large legacy
code bases. But first, some community
news. Free Code Camp just published a
new course taught by legendary Harvard
computer science professor Dr. David J.
Men. He's a legend. I'm going to have
him on the podcast soon. This
comprehensive cyber security for
beginners course will teach you how to
secure accounts, databases, and entire

tons of practical tips for securing your
privacy in an increasingly adversarial
world. That's an 8hour free course on
the free co-amp YouTube channel. Check
it out after you finish listening to
this podcast. And then Free Code Camp
also published an extensive guide to
passing the certified Kubernetes
administrator exam. This is a very
popular DevOps certification. Bo KS whom
you may rec recognize from the guy who
runs the free co YouTube channel. Uh he
teaches this course and it'll walk you
through key DevOps concepts. You'll
start by setting up your uh Kubernetes
practice environment. thing of
bootstrap, a multi-node cluster, and
your control plane. You're going to
learn about Helm, high availability,

so many common microser service patterns
uh like onion architecture, internet of
things, functions, so much more. It's a
five-hour course free on the free co

for example. If you want to do that but
at 64 kilobits per second or 128
kilobits per second with no ads, no

up codereadio.freecamp.org,
click play and music starts. And then
when you're done, you just close the

Great song. It's eight minutes long.
Just jam out to it. Free Code Camp has
shirts that are awesome. I'm wearing one
right now. They are really tight. They
fit your body perfectly. It's tribal

Free Code Camp logo, stencil it on,
screen print it on. That's cool for
non-commercial use if you want to do
that. But if you want to get the exact
shirt that I'm wearing, this is screen

Virginia, go to shop.freecodeamp.org.
And now for today's interview, Abby
Perini taught herself programming at age
27 while working as an administrator at
an engineering recruitment agency. So,
she's seen the inside of recruiting
agencies and she has a lot of insights
from having uh talked with both
recruiters and with candidates as a
result of that process. She's worked
extensively with large legacy code bases
and she's going to teach you some best
practices uh for how to manage these.
You're going to learn how to hit the
ground running when you join a company
that has a giant legacy codebase,
perhaps in a language that you're
relatively unfamiliar with. You're going
to learn how to get employers to
remember you and actually respond to you
when you reach out trying to get a job
there. Uh she's going to talk about how
she adapted to her adult ADHD diagnosis
and how she stays focused and ships code
and how knitting and cosplay gave her a
ton of perspective as a dev. Abby Pini,
welcome to the Free Code Camp podcast.
>> Thank you for having me.
>> Yeah, it's great to finally talk with
you on the podcast. You're somebody I
met at the Commit Your Code Conference
here in Dallas,
>> and I just immediately was like, ""Wow,
she's got a lot to talk about.
>> I uh yeah, I'm always surprised by what
pieces of the lore surprise people.""
[laughter]
>> Yeah. Well, first I know you've done a
lot of work with legacy code bases and
you've written a lot about
maintainability in legacy code bases.
What are some of the egregious
mistakes you've seen that devs have made
over the years with large legacy code
bases?
>> I think one of the first things that
makes a legacy codebase a legacy
codebase is absolutely no documentation,
no tests, nothing. You're just handed
this huge pile of code and told, ""Fix
it, please."" And that's a huge challenge
for people because a lot of times these
code bases weren't built with
maintainability in mind. So things are
intertwined. So touching one thing that
you would think is totally fine to touch
by itself breaks 12 things on the other
side of the app that you weren't even
thinking about. So, a lot of times I see
things like short-term contracts uh for
developers and they're just like, ""Hey,
we just need like a little thing added
on."" And that'll make the legacy
codebase better. But because they don't
have much time and don't have time to
get familiar with the codebase, it'll
often be a rewrite of something that
already exists in a second way. and
you'll find that things pile up so that
you've got one feature rewritten six
different ways and when you go to fix
that because one place is broken, it's
just chaos. It's it's a lot. Uh the
other thing is like dumping all of the
code in one file. I've seen files with
uh 10,000 lines of code being the main
file and like half of that was just
global variables and that tends to
get very very difficult to untangle very
quickly. So those are those are a few of
my favorites.
So, being sure to actually like put some
thought into how you're going to lay out
the files. Um, when you're going into a
codebase that you haven't seen before
and it's big, sprawling, maybe decades
of work has gone into this codebase, how
do you go about initially kind of
getting a feel for the lay of the land?
>> Uh, a lot of times I will just start
breaking things like I'll remove a line
and see what that affects and how it is.
But I approach um the way I troubleshoot
and break things and things like that as
little experiments. So I'll come up with
a hypothesis before like removing this
line of code will result in these things
breaking and then uh find a way to test
that and do little experiments across
the codebase as I slowly figure out
what's going on. And uh one of the
things my very first senior tried to
drill into my head was that it doesn't
matter how long the name is as long as
it tells you what the thing does. And
admittedly, he was German, so [laughter]
they're a little more comfortable with
long names than we are.
>> Yeah. And and just for context, German
is basically taking a bunch of like the
equivalent of like Latin roots and
slapping them together into like these
giant words that look comically long to
an English speaker, but are like totally
normal and kind of self-explanatory
almost.
>> German. Yeah. So he was like, ""All
right, so when you write a function, all
I want to know is what it does by the
name."" And that cuts down on a lot of
like comments that people will leave or
like necessary documentation because if
you come up to a function, the function
says gets XYZ, then you're like, ""Okay,
then it gets XYZ."" But back to the
maintainability point, if it does more
things than that, that's when you need
to start documenting or breaking out or
things like that.
>> Uh I forgot where we were going. How do
you feel about [laughter]
how do you feel about comments in code?
So, this is one of those things it's
like a religious war essentially like
some people are like you shouldn't have
to comment your code and others are like
that the the code is its own
documentation. Yeah.
>> Is the uh an argument people make and
then other people are like it's totally
fine to just take a lot of time to
really explain your thoughts and leave
notes as to why it's structured the way
it is. You're leaving artifacts for
future developers to read. Where do you
fall on that if you want to consider it
like kind of a spectrum of like no
comments to fully fleshed out comments?
>> I I guess I'm in rehab. Uh I one of my
favorite seniors ever, I want to be
clear, love her to death, was like no
comments in code. Never put a comment
in. So when I came to this job, my
current senior is like, ""No, I I want to
see comments if things if that will help
me understand what's happening."" And
like I want the code it to be readable
more than I want it to be short or like
code golf if that makes sense. Code golf
being uh a competition to see how many
uh if you can do a thing in the least
possible number of characters. Um and
then I also came from a huge legacy
codebase with absolutely no
documentation in it. So um I think as
long as you have a framework and an
agreement in within your team um I like
obviously I work in JavaScript so I like
JS docs uh syntax which you can use in a
bunch of different tools like it's it's
pretty standardized at this point. So
yeah, it's it's great if your functions,
especially with like something like
TypeScript, can explain themselves, but
sometimes you come across like a
business logic reason that you're doing
something and the function itself may
seem kind of insane until you're like,
hey, I'm doing this because we need XYZ
to happen because of business logic,
like that's a perfectly fine comment.
But if you're just like the function is
named well, the all the arguments are
typed out, like it's it's like three
lines in the function, like that doesn't
usually need a comment. Yeah. It's one
of those parts of coding that's more a
creative art than it is like a perfect
science. And I think that's why there's
like dogma about it.
>> So, just to be clear, you're
uh you don't always have to have a
comment, but if it makes sense to have a
comment, don't let some sort of weird
axiom like hold you back. Exactly. Like
if you in six months is definitely going
to forget why you wrote this function,
it's okay to add a little comment that's
like, ""Hey, I'm doing this for this
reason."" Uh my seniors sometimes leave
comments that are like, ""I know that
this is not optimal. If you can figure
out how to fix it, great. Until then,
don't touch it. It works now. It's fine.
Don't worry about it."" [laughter]
>> Yeah. Well, what would you say to a dev
who's just been doing like their own
small projects? Maybe they've been
working with a small team uh on like
hackathon projects or they're just
running a new nex.js app and maintaining
that for like six months and adding
functionality and they've never seen a
20-year-old codebase that has lots of
programming languages and probably lots
of dependencies that are maybe even
deprecated that are kept in life support
like through sustained versions of XYZ
or or require a very
>> you know arcane setup to get everything
to work right. Um like
>> I mean not even
>> how would you prepare them for that?
>> Like it hasn't been updated in the last
two years. So you have to update it like
six versions and 12 packages and things
like that. Um the first thing that you
want to do is understand the purpose of
the app like what is it trying to do and
then break it down into its major big
pieces. I like to draw out uh diagrams
and flowcharts as I understand it. And
that's easy to take to someone like a
senior and be like, ""Hey, where's
am I getting all of this correct? Is
there an issue in what I've drawn out?""
And uh I've had a couple seniors be
like, ""This is great. Okay, here's the
we need another arrow here, and then
this box does this."" And then like you
add this in. And once you've got mental
models and you can start just with bugs.
I like using bugs the best because
you're like, ""Okay, here's what it
should be doing. Here's what it's doing.
How do I get it back over here?"" And to
do that, you usually have to understand
at least a couple parts of the app to
understand how to get it into its right
state. And I'm always I've always been a
build tolearn kind of person. So
breaking it and using bugs is uh my
favorite way of understanding a large
codebase.
>> Awesome. And when you document, do you
use any sort of standard like UML or
anything like that or do you just use
your own kind of like is this purposely
just for your own kind of like
comprehension purposes?
>> If you want to be able to add to
documentation, which is the thing that I
uh expect juniors to do when they
onboard, like look at the onboarding
documentation, tell me what you didn't
understand, where it's wrong, because I
have seen plenty of senior devs be like,
""Oh, this Linux command explains
everything."" And it's like, ""I don't
know what that Linux command, what do
you mean?"" like I have to go look what
that does and like figure that out. So I
expect every junior to help make
onboarding better by showing the uh
missing pieces of what I assume you know
and uh be able to put that in the
documentation. But when I'm doing
drawing like diagrams and stuff, I could
be using like I think there's like
mermaid and and markdown and stuff like
that and like there's always something
in some tool that somebody's using at
that company. I draw stuff out in boxes
in Keynote a lot or like any anything
that can make a black and white box on
my computer I have used to make a
diagram at some point because at a
certain point it doesn't matter if
you're going to keep this around for
forever or like be able to work it into
the documentation like you can always
rewrite it in whatever the official
method is that someone points out to you
but just the act of drawing it out and
writing down that mental model. I also
like to use um an e- in tablet which is
like writing on paper. So it still does
the same like handtobrain connection to
make you remember but it's digital so I
can upload it to the cloud and then send
it to somebody. So
>> any any tool will work.
>> So if I understand like two things I'm
taking away from this. First using like
a formal kind of like diagram system
like universal modeling language UML uh
could be like an impediment. It's like
oh man what's the standard way of doing
this and that may slow you down and that
may also introduce friction which makes
you less
>> eager to diagram
>> and the second thing is a lot of what
you're diagramming is not just for
posterity but it's the process of
diagramming
>> helps you better gro the layout of the
codebase and and understand the
relationships within that codebase.
>> Exactly. Like my very first uh codebase
I ever worked in had a ton of
microservices including like Google
PubSub which is essentially a black box.
Like it stuff goes in and stuff comes
out but like what happens in there is a
little you don't actually need to
understand that. So what I was drawing
out was like does the Damon server go to
PubSub or does PubSub go to the Damon
server or like what order does it happen
in? And those are the things that I
needed to get straight in my head.
>> Yeah, makes a lot of sense. Well, I
think you and I could talk about
maintainability for a long time. If
anybody's really interested in
maintainability, check out Robbie
Russell's podcast. The I think it's just
called the maintainability podcast. He
just talks about maintainability in
legacy code bases. Robbie Russell, of
course, the creator of Oh my Zshell,
very popular uh tool that a lot of Mac
users use to kind of super user
>> jazz up their uh terminal stuff like
that. uh very very chill dude who's been
on the podcast before as well. I'll put
a link to his interview. Uh if anybody's
really interested in going hard on
maintainability.
>> Yeah.
>> I want to learn more about you. So you
are uh a self-taught dev and you have a
non-traditional kind of background for
developers and you've got a winding
journey into building software. maybe
you can take us back to just early life
and like ramping up and and take us
through the decisions you made and when
it came to, you know, attending
university, all that stuff.
>> Yeah. Um, so I went to a college
preparatory school from third to 12th
grade. So going to college was never a
question. Uh, you had to get accepted
into college to graduate. And so it was
never like a should I go to college? If
I go to college, like what is that going
to do for me? No, it was always you're
going to college. So, I went to Clemson
and I started out in um they call it
graphic communications. I thought I was
going to be a graphic designer and they
were like, ""Haha, no, you'll be printing
things for the rest of your life."" And I
was like, ""Oh, I don't want to do that.""
And I was already in a psychology course
and I was enjoying it. And through that,
I had actually started already joining
graduate level research. So, um, my very
first participation in research was as a
TA teaching people how to like build
cubes in Second Life because my
professor was, uh, studying how virtual
reality affected people learning. And so
I was like, okay, I can get course
credit for teaching people how to build
cubes in Second Life. That's cool. And
from there I ended up on a
multi-semester
uh research project where I would run um
the actual experiment. I would help
clean and code data. I would helped run
the statistical analysis on data and I
actually helped write the paper. So I am
published on a paper about how mental
health stigma affects people seeking
help. So basically, our opinions and the
things that we say make people more or
less likely to actually seek out help
that they need for their mental health
issues. And by the time I got to my
senior year, I had been working with
these graduate students for years, and I
was like, I don't want to do graduate
school. They're they're not making any
money. They're miserable for a lot of
the time. They're not sleeping. Like,
there's a lot going on, and that's not
the path for me. I'm pretty done with
school. And part of that was being
undiagnosed ADHD and college being
easier for me than high school had been.
So I was just coasting.
>> Yeah.
>> And
as part of my senior year electives, I
started taking yoga and I ended up being
a TA for my yoga teacher and then taking
an advanced yoga course and eventually
got my yoga certification in Atlanta.
And then I realized I had missed the
yoga teacher bubble. [laughter] Like
there was no money there either. During
my senior year, I was like, ""No, I don't
want to do graduate school."" And my
adviser was like, ""Well, I guess you're
just going to get whatever job you can
get."" And I was like, ""I don't what
[laughter] is there no path for that?""
Okay. And so after yoga teaching, I
worked um in retail and a pet store for
a while and then almost turned dog
training into a career, which is kind of
adjacent to psychology and could have
been kind of the same path. And then I
ended up getting a job in high volume
MSP recruiting which meant that I by the
end of five years had been an objective
observer in thousands of interview
processes. So I learned a lot of lessons
that turned out to be very useful when I
finally was like I can't do this
anymore. My boss had known that for
years. I had applied within and without
the company. I got rejected from a job
where I was always teach like training
them. Yeah. like like I was like I can
do this role because I am usually
training them on half the job and they
said something like well you don't have
enough Excel experience and I was like I
can learn Excel
what do you mean? So I was looking at
data science and that required more
school and I didn't really want to go
back to school and like then my husband
looked at me and he was like well what
about web development? You like colors
you can move boxes around pixel by pixel
[laughter] that probably be good for
you. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Yeah. That's a very simplified
view of web development, but
>> you know, it was enough for me to start
looking and investigate and I was like,
""Okay."" And I committed to a boot camp.
And that was in March of 2020. And I got
uh pre-work from the teacher that I was
originally supposed to be with. And so
for 6 months, I studied web development
basically in a vacuum. And because
nobody was hiring because it was March
2020, I also was basically getting paid
to learn to code eight hours a day. And
I this is the conversation
about how we met where I was like, oh
yeah, you know, like I tried like the
kind of like sandboxy like learn how to
code Python things before, but it wasn't
until I was like struggling in the
command line and something finally
printed out that I was like, ""Yes, this
is it. This is what I want to do."" The
struggle and then the payoff. That's
where I love to be.
>> Um, and then I did boot camp and that
was like drinking from a fire hose. made
a few good friends there and then uh fe
January 2021 is when my boot camp ended
and I was like all right let's get the
job and I wasn't getting any bites on my
uh applications when I was using like a
template so I started um rewriting my
portfolio and writing about rewriting my
portfolio because I had been challenged
to write during boot camp by the boot
camp instructor and I had seen some
traction on a couple of my blogs already
and I was like, ""Well, this is clearly
like a like a second portfolio, so I'll
keep writing."" And it was my one of my
former bosses saw my post about writing
or rewriting my portfolio and put my
resume in front of the CTO at my old
company and my old company ended up
hiring me back and that's how I got my
first developer job. And it took me
about I got the job in April of 2021. I
got the job in March of 2021. started in
April of 2021, so it took me about a
year to do it.
>> That's great. Oh, man. So many questions
to dive in. First, Clem Clemson
University, great school, very
selective. I think it's southern car
South Carolina.
>> South Carolina. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Okay. I was getting Carolina Dakota
mixed up. Yeah. I'm like South Dakota or
South Carolina. I can't remember. One is
much colder than the other. So
>> true.
>> Uh that's cool. That's a that's a good
school. It sounds like your prep school
served you well to get you over there.
Uh it also sounds as like uh they had
very kind of like parochial type of
education if they're like teaching you
that sort of stuff. Uh and and so you
switched majors a few times and it
sounds like that helped as well. Um that
you were like that you had your antennas
up to realize, oh wow, this is not what
I want to be doing and you were able to
pivot pretty quickly without racking up
tons of additional, you know, years
worth of student debt and stuff. Uh the
the other questions that uh came up uh
you you attended the boot camp which
boot camps were this thing [laughter]
basically I talk about them in the past
hence because I don't know if anybody
still goes to them but uh but they were
they have been helpful for some people
and there are some good ones. It's not
all just a bunch of graft uh but there
is a lot of that too. Uh, can you talk
about like what your experience was like
at a boot camp for people who may feel
like they're missing out on that
experience and then how much that
experience helped you and whether you'd
recommend it for other people?
>> Yeah. So, when I started the boot camp,
I still had no idea that I had ADHD and
I knew that I needed structure and I
needed accountability. I needed someone
to be like, ""Hey, you haven't finished
your work."" Uh the other part that I did
not consciously realize is I'm a highly
competitive person. So if there are
other people in the class, I'm gonna be
like, I want an A. Give give me an A.
Whatever that means.
>> So extrinsic pressure from uh
competition.
>> Exactly.
>> Also, very quickly before you continue,
I said
>> uh a lot of them are graph. They're I
meant the word grift. Grift is a scam.
Graft is bribing somebody.
>> They're different words. And I just want
to make sure people know I know the
difference. And I just misspoke. Okay.
>> I was like, skid graft. That's sure. All
right. Whatever.
>> Well, yeah. This is the good kind
[laughter] of graft. The graft you never
want, but the kind that will be very
helpful if you need it.
>> Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] Not the other
type of graft. Okay.
>> Yes.
>> Um, yeah. I wouldn't say that they were
a graft. I would say that four months is
a very short amount of time to learn the
amount of things that you need to learn
to work on a job as a web developer. And
I there were a lot of people in my
course who had signed up three days
before and like I had been studying for
six months so they were like wow do you
have like programming experience and I
was like no this I've been working on
this and
there were a lot of things where I was
like I'm finding it difficult to keep
up. I cannot imagine like if I had just
started this like 3 days before because
I already have a lot of the terms. I've
already, you know, created a virtual
environment on a Mac to be able to run
Python. Like all of those kinds of
things. Uh studied command line. Like
there's a lot of jargon, like a lot of
vocabulary that you need to know just to
be able to have a conversation about the
things that you need to learn. And this
is a thing that a lot of people when
trying to teach juniors and beginners
beginners forget entirely. Like you can
say a word and five of those words I
need to go look up. That's that's a
really difficult sentence for me. Um,
and I found that once we got to like
career services, like we need to find a
job, career services tried, but I had
all of the recruiting experience, so I
was like, here's how to do it.
>> Yeah.
>> Okay. So, you were better prepared to
just go on your own without making use
of career services.
>> Which is why when people talk to me
about it, I don't recommend a boot camp.
I recommend a program like Leon's, like
100 devs, where
>> Yeah, 100 devs.
He has he has a structure. He has a
community. He has that accountability.
But you don't have to rack up debt or
pay an exorbitant fee out of pocket. And
you don't have to do it in four months
or that that's it. You like you've
failed the program or whatever. And I as
someone who has done a lot of school was
like there weren't like tests. There
weren't like there were projects that we
had to turn in but they were group
projects so like people could coast and
stuff like that. So, you know, it's um
if I went back, I would probably do a
bunch more research. I don't know if 100
devs when did 100 devs start? Was it
2020?
>> It started during the pandemic. So, it
would it would have been after your time
going through this process.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, 100 devs wasn't an
option for me, but it's an option for
you.
>> Absolutely. Yeah. And I'll second like I
I have a very high opinion of Leon and
the work he's doing for the community.
It doesn't cost you a thing. Uh the risk
is your time but anything you do to
invest time in learning you are risking
your time. Like free co is free but you
do have to actually spend time uh which
is more than a lot of people have the
means to do. Uh but uh it's just a
question of priorities and a question of
like mapping out and planning and making
the time uh is what I would argue. So,
um, would you recommend going to a boot
camp in 2025 or would you just recommend
100 devs?
>> Just 100 devs or even learning on your
own if you're someone who doesn't need
the structure and accountability to make
sure that you're learning every day. Um,
I know I watched Dom's episode of this
podcast a few days ago and he talked
about, you know, just every day was
like, can I move the bar a little bit
forward? Like, can I do a little bit of
that? And that's really what it was for
me. It was a full year of like every
single day I am doing something to
learn. And I think [laughter]
you can still see like my entire stack
of note cards that I made because every
time I didn't know a word, I would write
it down. Like I used every study tool in
my arsenal that I had ever learned. And
that paid off when I was getting like
the interview quizzes and things like
that when I was doing the job search.
>> Yeah. Well, I want to dive deeper into
your experience as a recruiter and like
sifting through all these resumes and
working with other recruiters and try to
better understand and empathize with
recruiters. I think in many respects and
actually agree or disagree, recruiters
are kind of the unsung heroes of the
tech labor market in the sense that like
they are providing service like that is
essentially picked up by the employer
rather than the person who's seeking a
job. So, it's in many ways it's free
help. Now, there are no free lunches in
economics, and I know that like the
compensation that they're paying the
recruiter, like some of that
theoretically could have gone to you
being able to get a higher salary if
they if you just apply directly and not
had a recruiter in the middle. Uh, but
I'm actually not sure if that actually
plays out that way in practice. Uh,
>> yeah.
>> Can you talk about recruiters and their
incentives and and how they operate a
little bit?
>> Absolutely. There is a vast difference
between somebody who is recruiting at
the company that they are employed by
and an external recruiter that is a
company entirely of recruiters. I worked
at the second type and I was an admin.
So I had a flat hourly wage. I did not
get a commission if I got people hired.
My job was from uh the moment that they
got an interview requested all the way
through after we hired them and they
needed something. So, at any point in
time, I had 150 people who could call me
up and be like, ""Hey, what's going on
with my interview process or my paycheck
or whatever?"" And I would have to send
them off to the right person. The other
part that I did was um so I said high
volume MSP. There would be a
>> what's MSP?
>> A managed service provider. So, a third
party would have a website that we would
get email notifications from and be able
to go into and they would post all of
the jobs that they needed. So I worked
with large contractor work forces uh
like Google's and other large companies
that maintained uh just so many
contractors that there was always a
contractor job coming up.
>> Yeah. So, so what you're describing is
kind of like Robert Half or
>> like uh like account temps is one that I
did kind of after college working as a
temporary accountant and like people are
like hey we need somebody who can do
account keeping you know clerical work
tax filings stuff like that. I worked
with uh physical engineering. So I was
everything from picker packers,
technicians to RFID engineers, um
industrial engineers, civil engineers
like and contracts could be anywhere
from 3 months to two years. Like it they
would be long. The benefits would be
different. But the whole idea was that
these contractors were employed by our
company, not the company that they were
working at. So there was, you know, a
bit of little wiggle room for companies
not to compensate them the same, not
give them benefits, stuff like that. So
any company that works a large
contractor workforce like that, I'm
always kind of a little suspicious of.
It's one of the one of the first things
I think about. But because of that,
because I had no stake in the game, I
didn't get a commission if they got
hired. I was the person a lot of times
that these uh third parties in between
us and the client would come and be
like, ""All right, what's your read? What
do you think?"" And so people who had
been nice to me, I would, you know, give
them the hard cell if I was asked or I
would do a lot of things to make sure
that they stayed up on top of the pile
and that we were constantly like, ""Hey,
what's the feedback? What's the
feedback?"" So, one of my biggest tricks
for people is at the end of an
interview, you ask when you should
expect feedback, and then you email them
if you do not get feedback on that
timeline. And then you follow up every
24 hours until you get feedback. And
people stare at me like I'm insane when
I tell them this. And I'm like, ""No,
it's you extremely polite. Like, hello,
I'm just following up. Have you heard
anything?"" But just doing that keeps you
your name at the top of the pile for
somebody. And then that means that
they're also having to be like, ""Hey,
what's
>> can I follow up on this person?
Remember, this person is waiting for
feedback."" Like that kind of stuff.
>> Um, as far as like
>> wiki wheel gets the grease, as they say.
Like I mean it may sound absurd. It may
sound like oh I'm imposing upon them.
I'm annoying the hell out of them. But
like
>> I mean it is kind of true like people
forget about stuff. Uh and if you want
to stand out like just merely, you know,
being high frequency,
>> being polite and in their minds. Yeah.
>> Yeah.
>> Yeah. And I know that some people will
like swear by your resume has to look a
certain way, your cover letter has to
look a certain way, blah blah blah blah
blah. And like as far as I've been able
to tell, all you have to do is convince
the people that you're talking to that
you can do the job and remind them that
you're [laughter] waiting for feedback.
Um, one of my favorite things is a thank
you note, like after every interview,
you know, like uh if you are walking out
the interview and you're like, ""Oh my
god, I wish I had said that."" That's
something to put in a thank you note
immediately following up after the
interview with uh just an email, an
attachment. Um, one of the stupidest
things I've seen is people who have
cover letters and thank you notes and
they have them in templates and they
don't fill out their little like
template things perfectly every time.
So, it'll be like, ""Hello, hiring
manager. I person would love to do
that."" And it's just like you guys, you
got to proofread. You got to make sure
that what you're sending people is is a
good uh look for you essentially, not
like a bunch of typos and leaving your
little brackets in and your template and
things like that. Yay or nay to having
LLMs customize your cover letters?
>> I I mean, if you pref proofread, I mean,
you can use AI, but it's got to be
right. So, [laughter] like, you know,
I I don't know. I don't have much
experience with that. So, it' be great.
>> Okay. Well, um,
>> oh, but to your point about, uh,
recruiters being, you know, the unsung
heroes, there are plenty of stories of
recruiters who have zero idea what
they're talking about about like
technologies and people get really mad
at them. And it's like yes abs
absolutely if you're recruiting in an
industry you should be knowledgeable
about what you're recruiting for but
also a lot of recruiters don't have the
time or capability for that right they
have a bunch of things coming across
their desk they have a lot of things so
the best thing you can do is educate
them [gasps]
which sounds ridiculous but like if they
say something wrong to you can be like
no this language is different from this
language and then they're going to be a
better advocate for you when they go
back to the hiring manager about why
you're a good fit.
>> Yeah.
>> And and one thing you said earlier, just
being nice to people.
>> Yeah.
>> You prefer to help people who are nice
to you. There's this the saying, mind
the gatekeeper.
>> Uh and in a way, you're kind of a
gatekeeper to the resources of time and
expertise and stuff that like a
candidate might have access to. So
similarly with a recruiter, if you're
polite to the recruiter and maybe say,
""Oh, actually that's a that's a common
misconception. Let me clarify this for
you so that uh you look more wellversed
in this when you're talking to other
people. Like they're gonna probably
appreciate that you
>> kind of put yourself out there and took
a took a risk frankly of politely
correcting them uh with good intentions.
Like I certainly would if somebody
corrects me and they do it in a polite
way, I'm like really grateful.
>> Yeah. And the other thing is it's the
same thing keeping your mind on top of
the stack. So, if you're uh I know
people like hate ATS's, but
>> yeah, applicant tracking systems.
>> Yes. If you get your resume in with the
keywords, when another job with those
keywords comes up, your resume is pulled
up as part of like that's what an
applicant tracking system is. So, I know
um I don't I recommend networking over
just tossing your resume into the void,
but I wouldn't see any application as
just like, oh, I've wasted my time on
that because I didn't hear back on that
specific application. You may hear back
from the same company 3 months from now
with a job that's a better fit for your
skills because you had entered your
resume in at that time. That's obviously
the long game if you have the time.
>> Well, everybody should be playing the
long game in my humble opinion.
[laughter] That that is very heartening
to hear that like
>> employers are actually like keeping that
in a database and referencing it uh
matching it against you know future
opportunities. So it could be that these
people are like I'm going to spend two
weeks and I'm going to do a thousand
applications. Well like you finally get
a job offer but then like a few months
later you're getting a whole bunch of
other people calling you like I already
have a job you know. Well maybe just
space it out a little bit right.
[laughter]
>> Yeah. But then
>> offer some like a few months in advance.
I mean, is does that sound like a better
strategy if you're planning to be on the
job market? Uh, or if you're on the job
market, just pace yourself while while
cultivating other opportunities in
addition to applying through
>> forms. I think people see networking as
like a transactional thing, right? Like
I have talked to you and thus I want
this thing and that we understand that
that's what our relationship is. But
I've seen so many people get jobs, you
know, years down the line because they
had been in an interview with this
person before and they were like, ""Oh, I
wish we had gotten to hire them."" Then
uh my my current boss, this is the
second time that he tried to hire me.
[laughter] So when he knew that I was
even remotely open to something again,
he was like, ""Let's do it. Let's this is
this is the time that we can get this to
work.""
>> Yeah, that's an interesting point. So it
could be that like for example there are
like a lot of people that have to sign
off on a person and somebody else on the
team blocked a candidate that that
person felt was really good but they
didn't have the leverage to advocate for
that person or override that other
person in their organization. But when
they it's when they're running the show
when they're the sole hiring manager or
when they're with a different you know
uh cader of people that they're going to
remember you favorably from an
interview. So, um, yeah, like like
I guess what you're saying gives me hope
that people aren't just spinning their
wheels and that they are making progress
even if that progress is invisible.
>> Yeah. I mean, it's the same thing that
we talked about with studying like every
day you're moving the bar forward a
little bit by a little bit. The best
advice I got during my job search uh was
from one of my one of my mentors about
how every interview is practice for the
one that works. And they were absolutely
right. like the one that worked. I was
like, I've heard this question before.
I've done this. I know this. I from all
of these interviews, all of the pieces
have fallen together. And I had finally
done it. Except, you know, at the time I
was laying on the floor afterwards
going, ""Oh my god, I bombed that
interview. It was so many questions. I
don't know."" And that was that was the
one that worked. It was the one that I
was on the top of my game. I was ready.
Like I was hungry and I knew I wanted
it. And finally the stars aligned. It's
it's so much luck in tech unfortunately
and like just being there at the right
time that all you can do is make sure
that you're ready at the right time. And
the other thing back to recruiters not
knowing like different technologies and
stuff, the number of times that we had
to go back to hiring managers and be
like, ""Here's the job description you
gave us."" And they're like, ""Well,
that's not going to get me the
candidates I want."" And we're like,
""Okay, so let's rewrite it to actually
bring in the candidates that you want to
see."" It got to the point where we had
candidates print out the job description
that they had applied to and take it
into the interview with them so that if
somebody was like, ""Wow, you're really
not a fit for this."" They could slide it
across the table and they could be like,
""Oh,
>> oh, I don't know.""
>> That's a good tip. That's a very useful
tip that is very counterintuitive. So,
right,
>> bring the uh bring the actual form. I'm
writing this.
>> Yeah. Bring the job description that you
are speaking to. There are a few things
in preparing for interviews that I
recommend. One is looking up like the
core values of the company and trying to
work those into your answers. Uh the
other one is bring in the job
description and like point towards
things on the job description that
you're like I've done this before like I
can do this, I can do that. But also
apply if even one bullet point were like
applies to you because you that hiring
manager may just have just like you know
it's their wish list of like the the 10x
engineer that doesn't exist and then all
they really need is someone who knows
React. So if that's what you know like
you can get your foot in the door and it
doesn't matter if you don't know the
other 12 bullet points on the on the
description.
>> Yeah. And just a note on understanding
the company culture like a lot of that
propagates down from the founder like
Amazon they carry around the I think
it's like the 14 rules that Jeff Bezos
came up with a lot of times the the
founder will have written a book like in
the case of Netflix uh and you can read
that and then you can kind of understand
the culture and if you're like like
>> showing that like hey I took the
initiative of actually reading the book
that the founder wrote if you can yeah
>> find a way to subtly work that in uh
that will give people uh you probably
positive feedback that you care about
culture and that you perceive to be an
issue
>> and that you don't just perceive this to
be a job like any other job. I'm just
looking for a paycheck. Uh because
employers don't like that kind of like
forthright pragmatism, I guess, or
mercenary nature.
>> It's totally valid for that to be your
reason to want a job, but we're trying
to convince the people that you'll fit
in and like do the work and all of that.
>> And um come with questions. Like if you
don't have any questions for the company
that you're interviewing because you're
also interviewing them, that is often
seen as a red flag. Like you're not
interested, you don't know what's going
on. And like I've had culture fit
questions that are like what what like
do we get together? Do we have like
events together? Like do we celebrate
anything as a company? Like
>> is there is there something fun going
on? [laughter]
They're like oh
>> no one's ever asked that before. That's
interesting. And then once again you're
sticking out in their mind.
Yeah,
>> it's just one of those things.
>> Well, I just want to repeat what you
said. Every interview is practice for
the one that works. And I hope that
people who are in the uh the grips of a
lengthy protracted job search,
especially if they've suffered a whole
bunch of setbacks, I hope they keep that
in mind. Uh because that that's very uh
energizing to hear. So, I want to talk a
little bit about your ADHD diagnosis and
learn more about how ADHD has affected
your life, how it affects your work.
>> How old were you when you got the
diagnosis?
>> I think I was 28. Um, wow. And part of
it, yeah, part of it was I always did
well in school, so nobody was
questioning it. But part of the reason I
did well in school is because I was so
anxious and like creating these like
life and death situations that were not
life and death within my head just to
motivate myself to get stuff done. And I
got really good at, you know, doing the
homework for this class uh one class
before like when because I knew this
class was easy and like we I wouldn't
have to do too much so I could do the
homework while the teacher was talking
and stuff like that.
Um, and then again I got to college and
I was like, ""Wow, this is easy. I get to
sleep."" Like [laughter]
I don't really have to study as much and
I just watched as I had been a voracious
reader my entire life and I just slowly
got to the point where I couldn't even
finish a book like it like I was so
burnt out on everything and I was like,
""Okay."" And like took this winding path
to get to coding. And while I was coding
and having to look at the way I learned
and stuff again, I was starting to see
some patterns that I had seen in my
husband and in my brother who were both
diagnosed. Uh my husband was diagnosed
in college and my brother was diagnosed
pretty young. And suddenly I was like,
okay, so the tips and tricks that I've
learned for them, what if I apply it to
myself? And then those started working.
And then I found a meme that was
hyperactivity in adults and it had like
five things listed and I just showed it
to my husband without saying anything.
and he was looking at the meme and then
looking at me and then looking at the
meme and I was like, ""Yeah."" And he was
like, ""Oh, no."" And then I'd be, you
know, in boot camp or studying or
whatever. And he'd come home and he'd be
like, ""When's the last time you took a
break?"" And I'd be like, ""Oh, you know,
like six, eight hours ago."" And he'd be
like, ""So, you haven't had any water or
gone to the bathroom or eaten?"" And I
was like, ""Yeah."" He's like, ""Uh-huh.
That's not it's not normal. That's a
thing that we should probably be
concerned about."" And eventually I found
the um assessment form that most uh
psychiatrists and psychologists give for
ADHD people online and I took it and I
was like that's a really high score.
[laughter] That's that's okay. And the
biggest thing that I found was I started
asking myself am I anxious or am I
hyperactive and I just need to fidget
and started investing in fidget toys and
things like that. And I was like, ""Wow,
this is this is really different. This
is making my life a lot easier."" The
other thing was I put down expecting
myself to remember anything because
people were like, ""But you're so
organized."" And I was like, ""Yes, my 12
organizational systems working in tandem
that I have to like work on every day is
it's not working for me, but I am
organized to you. So that's something
that I need to unpack."" And I finally um
made an appointment. It was co so
tellahalth and got the assessment. And
she was like, ""Well, yeah, you still
have to legally take a test, but I think
we can go ahead and [clears throat] like
prescribe uh Adderall because it's
pretty black and white."" And I was like,
""Oh, okay."" And the day I took
medication for the first time, I was
like,
>> ""This is oh [laughter] this is what
people mean by focus. Okay."" And I'd
been practicing yoga for years. I had
been working on a second certification
before the pandemic. Like there were so
many things that my teachers had tried
to teach me and I did yoga that day and
I was like well yeah it's a way easier
to focus on your breath and stuff now
like that makes so much more sense to
me. So it was really partially coding
and partially like social media that
finally showed me that there was a
reason that I had always felt like I was
struggling so much more than other
people. And one of the things that came
up recently that somebody else was
talking about was um I was always trying
so hard. Like yes, I was succeeding, but
I was trying four or five times harder
than other people would have to to do
those things. And once I finally was
able to unpack a lot of that and set it
down, uh that's when I finally was like,
""Oh, I can actually lean into the brain,
the way my brain works, and still get
things done."" So there's a lot of um
tips and tricks and you know the biggest
tip and trick of them all is that one
will always stop working so you have to
switch to the other one and you can
maybe rotate them out but like it's it's
always going to be a fun
>> Yeah. I mean when you say one will stop
working you you mean the ADHD medication
>> um
>> or the methodology because I've heard
that after a few years the efficacy
starts to fade. So the big thing that I
think that people miss a lot with
psychiatric medication is that the
medication is to make it easier for you
to introduce healthy behaviors. So it
should never be the medication just by
itself is going to solve all your
problems. The medication is why I now
instinctively go I'm eating lunch. I
should empty the dishwasher. like I've
managed to train myself to do the things
that and like chain habits and things
like that that it was really difficult
for me to even make a habit out of
brushing my teeth every morning and now
I'm able to have like a a full like
brush my teeth, wash my face, like a
whole routine and stuff like that. But
that was me working on behaviors with
the help of the medication, not just me
relying on medication to make my life
suddenly work better. But I mean like um
you know some days the like a physical
pomodoro timer works for me. So like
even um with time blindness watching
time go by and make sure I realize that
I'm hyperfocusing. I'll set a 25m minute
timer and then it'll go off and it'll be
like wow 25 minutes just went by and
that helps me make my day schedule go a
little bit smoother. But then some days
I can't do the physical Pomodoro timer.
Maybe I need um a browser window with a
timer up next to the coding window and
I'll switch back and forth between
whatever is working that day. Um I know
you had mentioned living a stimulus-free
lifestyle that is not
>> disclosures real quick. Uh so first of
all, we are not like clinical
psychologists. You do have an
undergraduate degree in psychology.
>> Yes.
>> Um
>> which means that I can tell you that I
can legally not tell you what to do.
>> Right on. And I do have an ADD diagnosis
from 198 1990 1991. Uh so I did take
rolin which was the drug that was taken
by kids back then. Uh it may still be in
use but I did I did not particularly
enjoy it and it was a short-lived
experiment. I started kind of like
hiding them in my mouth and then
spitting them out as soon as my parents
were out of out of sight because I
didn't like the way they made me feel.
And to this day I don't do any
psychoactive substances other than
caffeine. That's that's literally it. I
don't drink alcohol or anything. Uh, not
that I am saying you can't do that
stuff. Feel free do you do you. But like
for me, yeah, I like being super low
stimulus. Like my phone's background is
black. My desktop's background is black.
Uh, I basically just have like this
environment. Like you see the stuff
behind me, but I'm not looking at that,
right? Like I would never have this
cluttered. like my my view outside is
just like a window and it's just looking
out at the culde-sac that I'm on and at
the trees and stuff and and I just like
to like I don't listen to music when I
work usually like I I'm like super duper
like low stimulus I think is the term.
Yeah. And so have you similarly
experimented with such things?
>> I cannot have notification sounds on
like any time any time of day. It
doesn't matter if I'm working or
anything like I cannot have notification
sounds on. And people are like, ""But
you're really responsive to your phone.""
I'm like, ""Yeah, because my phone
lighting up is enough. If I hear a
sound, it's over. Like that is the only
thing that I will be focusing on."" And
with the way that phones are made these
days, like it's just constant. It's
silent.
>> They want you to constantly be pulled
back into it. Everybody's put push
notifications on apps, which Recode
Camp, we're guilty. We remind people to
do their daily coding challenges, but uh
but but like
>> all that is good. Turn off your
notifications, people. especially if you
have any of these symptoms that you and
I I guess seem to exhibit.
>> Yeah. And I'm super hyperactive. Like if
I am not uh if I don't have a way to be
moving or like listening to music while
I'm coding or something like that, if
there's not a second thing going on,
then I will find a second thing to be
distracted by. So I have, you know, a
lot of everybody loves a lowfi coding
playlist. I also I really got into EDM
that my husband hates because he's like
it none of the noises make sense. I'm
like, ""Yeah, [laughter] yes,
>> it's the point."" But I also I think I
have uh like 15 fidget toys on this desk
right now. So like I can reach for
something and just like be fidgeting. If
I need to like be in a meeting or
something, I'll do a lot of uh drawing
and writing and stuff like that. In
school, my teachers would try to get me
in trouble for drawing during class
except I'd be able to answer every
single question that they asked me. So
they eventually would just give up and
let me draw. So there were a lot of ways
that I found uh to fidget and get that
energy out that were socially
acceptable. And one of them is chewing
my lips. So a lot of the fidgets are to
not make me internalize it and to make
sure that I'm doing it outside and not
uh harming myself. And uh there are a
lot of ways that like I will get so
hyperfocused. That's something I really
struggle with with coding. um that I I
really struggled to pull my focus away
from my computer. So, there are apps
that are like um I think I use Timeout
where you can use HTML to customize it
to show you whatever you want, but
eventually it will be like, ""Hey,
[laughter]
get up. Get away from your computer. I'm
going to block down everything on this
computer. You have to go move.""
>> So, uh that's been one of the one of the
things my PT is constantly like, ""Stop
sitting like a shrimp. Move more. Like,
use ergonomic stuff."" So, I have like a
super customizable chair and stuff like
that.
>> Yeah. What was it? What is PT?
>> Physical therapist.
>> Physical therapist.
>> I have a connective tissue disorder. So,
I have my bones are loose, so I have a
lot of issues.
>> Yeah. Yeah. Well, um, man, those are so
many helpful tips for people. So, I have
some random grab bag questions for you.
Uh, very hyped. Uh, and by the way, if
anybody's asking about like Ask Jan,
like I'm gonna put all those links in
the description. These are great. Um, so
some questions that I have. Uh, you are
a physical maker. Like those for those
of you who are listening to this rather
than watching it, which is I think is
how most people consume the podcast is
just listening it. You have a big rack
of yarn behind you.
>> Yeah, they're too they're made for
storing wine instead of storing yarn.
[laughter]
>> Okay.
>> Um,
>> but yeah,
>> yarn is cylindrical like wine bottles,
so it works. Yeah, it does. Yeah, it's
just a lot of stuffing it in there. Um,
yeah. So, when I was in college, uh, I
was having a really hard time. I was in
a long-distance relationship, like a lot
of things were going on. And my, uh, now
sister-in-law gave me a little booklet
on how to make, uh, crochet dolls, which
are called Amigurroomi.
And I still have pictures of my sad
little lumpy first little dinosaur guy
and like all that. And immediately I was
hooked because a I have that style of
ADHD where I don't ask how hard it is. I
just want to make the thing. So I'm
gonna make the thing and you know might
be a little disappointed that it doesn't
turn out perfect the very first time I
try it. But I'll just I'll just keep
doing it. I'll just figure out how to
make the things that I want to make. And
so I started with crochet. I crocheted
for a long time. Um my roommates got me
into crossstitch for a bit. So I've done
crossstitch and embroidery and a bunch
of things. Actually, for one psych one
psychology class, I turned in a rorchack
ink blot uh crossstitched as one of my
uh like tests. That was fun. It was a
creative project. And then um uh several
years ago, I was in a yarn store in
Asheville, North Carolina, and the
owner, one of the owners of Pearls Yarn
Emporium
makes patterns. And he's also a dungeon
master for D&D. And so he had made a
pattern that was this big long scarf
that had the map of the dungeon on the
scarf with little charms for all the
monsters. And that's how I got into
knitting. And again, they thought I was
insane because they were like, ""You're
going to have to learn how to knit and
pearl at the same time."" And I was like,
""It's fine. Still probably my best color
work project, which is annoying, but it
is what it is."" And so I've just picked
up, you know, macra during the pandemic
like everybody else. Um all all kinds of
stuff. I'm really big into cooking and
baking. And then in 2015,
I made I hand sewed, well, I machine
sewed a costume, a Sailor Moon costume,
and I showed up to my friend's Halloween
party, and she was like, ""Do you know
what cosplay is? Like, have you been to
the big fan convention in our town?"" And
I was like, ""No, what's what's cosplay?""
And so then I started getting really
into costumes. And that's the big like
for me, there's so many different
projects encompassed in it. Like one day
I could be figuring out how to make
props out of uh foam. I could be
figuring out how to sew a type of
garment I've never sewn before. Um
makeup and paint and like all kinds of
things. It's all a new project every
single day. And um somewhat it's tied
into going my going to tech conferences.
I have people who remember me from a
render ATL dressed as Bombshell Batwoman
or the year we did Gandalf and Sormon.
Last year we did or this year we did uh
Buzz Lightyear and Woody and Jesse. And
then um at Magnolia Conf this year we
also did K-pop Demon Hunters and I made
the wigs and my friends made the props.
Like it's it's very fun and it ties it's
the same part of the brain that I use
for the creative part of coding because
during boot camp I had to put it all
down. Like I could not knit, I could not
crochet. It's the exact same part of
your brain. And that's when I discovered
this very interesting um history of
programming and fiber being really
intertwined. The first use of punch
cards was the jakard loom to make like
patterns for tapestries and things like
that. And uh there's a there's a lot
more. Um, little old lady memory is when
MIT trained women to weave uh ones and
zeros into wire so that it could be used
in the Apollo uh to make the shuttle
work. And like um now we're even seeing
the standardization of like knitting
patterns is very useful to teaching
beginners programming because it uses
four loops. It uses while loops like uh
good pattern writers will use dry do not
repeat yourself and then um you get the
output like you make the output based on
the pattern. you can teach about like QA
and testing from okay so I have this
output but does that match what I
expected to get out of the pattern like
where did I go wrong where was the bug
that kind of thing and it's also I think
a lot of people would benefit from the
physicality of making and understanding
that iteration because I think a lot of
people get frustrated when things don't
work out the first time whereas like
coming from that maker's background
that's what interested me about
programming that like I I'm just going
to try one more thing. I'm going to try
this. I'm going to try that. I'm going
to get a new puzzle every day. Like, I'm
going to solve it. [clears throat] It's
it's definitely the same part of my
brain to me. It's it's not a I'm a maker
or a coder. Like, it's it's the same
thing. I'm a maker in both ways.
>> Yeah, man. That is really awesome. Uh
that there are so many overlaps. Like, I
didn't know that stuff about uh
knitting, for example. And and I'm going
to link to the little old lady pro
memory project. Great name for a
project. uh very uh illustrative. Um
>> I want to ask what are some of the
takeaways that you have from being I
guess a prolific maker making lots of
costumes other projects and what you
carry with you from that uh to coding.
So
there's definitely an aspect of
something like knitting [snorts] where
okay, I'm in the knitting. I'm looking
at it. I'm looking at every single
stitch. I know exactly what mistakes I
made, right? Like I know from a mile
away that this part is messed up. And I
learned pretty early on to go to like my
husband. I can't do my husband now
because I've trained him too well, but I
go to my husband and go, ""Can you tell
me which where I messed up? like tell me
where
>> train him in knitting.
>> Well, he he can recognize machine
knitting machine knitting versus hand
knitting and like all this different
stuff. So, he can actually like kind of
see the patterns at this point. So, I
know that it really doesn't matter if he
doesn't notice it. But, uh for a long
time, he didn't notice any of the
mistakes. So, it allowed me to let go of
a lot of that perfectionism that was
preventing me from starting things a lot
of times where, you know, oh, I like I
don't know if I can do this perfectly.
So, there there's a sweater that I made
that really impresses knitts and I only
made it because I had no idea what I was
doing at the time. You either make it if
you're really really experienced or you
don't know what you're getting yourself
into. And like I need to go back and fix
it because I didn't know how to do a
stitch and there are big holes forming
like where I put the uh sleeves on. But
as far as anybody else could tell like
it was it was perfectly fine. It was
great. and taking that kind of mentality
into coding you know especially with
like front end um I have a whole talk on
design for non-designers because a lot
of people like backend um people who are
just getting started will see how their
site looks like something from the '9s
and be like well I'm not good at this
like I can never I I have to stop
because I it's not perfect and for a
long time that wasn't really a problem
for me like the blank page getting
started. I knew I just needed to slap
something on there and get started and
it would be fine. It didn't have to be
perfect. And some of that goes into
um the like user experience. Like if a
user is going to care about it, then
yes, I should spend a lot of time on it.
But if a user is not or a user or a
co-orker or something is not going to be
like, why is this not made exactly the
perfect way? Like I don't have to waste
energy on that. Does that make sense?
Yeah. So,
>> yeah,
>> first of all, there's that like I think
it's a um like a curve of distribution.
It's like a mean curve and it's like a
it's a mean. So, on one part you got the
the dumb guy who's like, ""Oh, let's do
this."" And then the person in the middle
who's like the median user of the thing
is like, ""Oh, it's better to do this.
This is the correct thing."" And then you
have like the really smart like wizard
looking dude and he's like, ""Oh, let's
just do this."" And it's the same thing
as the dumb guy. and the people in the
middle are kind of overthinking it
essentially [laughter]
is the the moral of the meme if there is
such a thing right. Uh so it sounds like
to an extent like your naive was one of
the reasons you could arrive at like
novel interesting approaches whereas a
moderately experienced person would have
just fallen back on the same kind of
grabag of huristics and yet the the
genius might have approached it like who
had the genius who had a lot of
experience might have approached it kind
of in a similar way to you or come come
to the same conclusion that you came to
as a naive person
>> bet and just the joy of creating is
often enough. Like I think a lot of
people are like, ""Oh, I need to solve
world hunger."" And that's the only
project that's any good that I can
dedicate my time to. And I'm out here uh
like making cute buttons and adding like
little drawings of my dog to my website
and stuff like that. And I found that
that sense of joy and um creation and
creativity is a lot of what feeds my
willingness to do the technical parts.
Um, my senior is currently trying to do
me get me to do config, which is not my
happy place. And um a lot of it I'm
realizing is because it's not like
creative and the errors are like weird
and you have to go toss hunt things down
and do a lot of systems thinking. But
what I enjoy and what I have often
begged people to let me do in a
development role is just to like create
buttons and do things that make the
users feel joy and like stuff like that
because I found that especially in my
writing when I tried to write for other
people it didn't it didn't feel right.
it didn't do well like it wasn't
anything but when I was following my own
joy and just writing about and doing
what I found fun because it was my free
time that's when people would also be
like you know what this is fun like I am
really enjoying this too so I I think
there's a a sense that you have to be
super serious to be super technical and
that's not what like some of a lot of
the developers that I highly respect my
senior Alex River um Cassidy bunch of
people, they all really focus on the joy
of creating and that's what's carried
them this far instead of, you know,
eating the computer into the ether and
then running into the woods to start a
cafe or whatever. [laughter]
>> Yes. The old uh giving up and going and
farming goats routine that many
>> programmers have. We've lost a lot of
programmers to goat farms.
>> So, let's say hypothetically you get
this is the final question. you you've
given me so much of your time and so
many interesting insights uh
>> such as that a sense of joy and
creativity can feed your desire to do
the technical parts. Ira write that down
verbatim what you were saying [laughter]
>> you're talking about how your manager is
making you do config. I mean, every task
needs to be done by somebody, right?
Somebody has to answer the support
emails for free code camp. Uh, somebody
has to review the AI slop, you know,
pull requests, uh, to our open source
project, things like that, right? Like
the But like, how do you get fired up?
How do you do you have any tricks for
finding joy in something like writing
configs?
>> Yeah. Um, I think a lot of times I have
to focus on what it is that I
want to see happen, right? Because that
original joy for me was, oh, okay, I
want to see something printed out in the
command line. I've seen it. This is
great. I want the button to do this. I
click the button and it does that. This
is great. So, if it's something more
abstract like config, I have to be like,
okay, so I need the project to run.
Like, that's my goal. And then as soon
as I reach that goal, I'm like, okay,
what's the next goal? Okay, it needs to
run with this thing in it or something
like that rather than um focusing on
like I need to work for this many hours.
Like that doesn't that doesn't work for
me. I won't do busy work necessarily. Um
but as long as there's a puzzle to
solve, I'm really invested. And I think
that's one of the things that makes
coding so well suited to people with uh
brains like ADHD brains is that we get
something novel. We get something that's
been estimated and time blocked and we
need to um finish it so that we can get
the next thing and all the systems
thinking and getting to think through
the big puzzle and all of that is what
keeps me coding. It's not necessarily
like, oh, I really just enjoy writing
switch statements. Like, that's not it.
The switch statement is a means to the
end. That's what is uh driving me to
work. The seeing the thing appear on the
page, the creativity of it.
>> So, if I could paraphrase what you're
saying, and correct me if I'm wrong,
>> you figure out a way to like essentially
set up a series of small wins along the
way
>> to whatever you need to achieve. You
like step backward. Okay, like what are
some things that are going to be
accomplishments that I can celebrate
along the way? So, if you take that kind
of approach, in theory, you could apply
it to like literally any work. Like you
could shoveling coal into a furnace like
I'll know when this when this train car
is like halfway empty. [laughter]
That'll be like a big win or something
like that, right?
>> Yeah. Yeah. I do it a lot with chores.
Like 10% is still progress. like if I
can get to the 10% then I usually am
motivated to get to you know closer to
50 or 100%. But that first 10% is always
the hardest for me. So that's the thing
that I'm like all right you get a little
little treat at the beginning. You get a
little treat when you get a little win
and then the little treats just keep you
keep you going through the boring stuff.
[laughter]
>> Right on. Well Abby Pini, it has been an
absolute pleasure learning from you uh
learning more about you and learning
hearing your insights into software
development. Um, I think people are
going to benefit great greatly from uh
this conversation and also from reading
your extensive blog which I'm linking to
Abby Normal. Uh, and I would encourage
people to read your work and u hopefully
we'll get some of it up on free code
camp. Uh, I think we're fasttracking
your editor application as we speak.
>> I have a I'm officially uh in it. I just
need to actually submit something. So
there's my 10% for this week. Yeah, your
author application. That's great. We'll
look forward to publishing some of your
work. Uh you're an excellent writer. Uh
I mean, I've spent like hours and hours
reading your work
>> and you're very good at communicating
your lived experience uh in a way that's
fun. It's it's really fun to read your
work. So um yeah, until next week
everybody. Happy coding.
>> Happy coding."

master the fretboard, the major scale,
and the triads. This course was
developed by baritone guitarist Alex
Gordon Hi-Fi. This course is designed to
transition you from simply playing
chords to truly understanding the
fundamental building blocks of music
theory on the instrument. It begins by
thoroughly mapping out the guitar
fretboard, establishing the core
relationship between the 12 chromatic
notes, half steps, and whole steps.
Next, you will master the major scale,
learning its formula, intervals, and
practical fretboard patterns across all
12 keys. Finally, you will learn about
triads, exploring their formulas,
inversions, bar chord voicings, and
their application in harmonizing the
major scale and creating compelling
chord progressions. This course will
give you a comprehensive theoretical
framework and the fingerboard
proficiency necessary to unlock a new
level of musical freedom.

[music]
[music]
[music]
>> The crux of self-contained guitar,
the crux of anything is the most
important point and issue. It is the
core. It is the heart. It is the
nitty-gritty. When I began contemplating
how to teach this self-contained guitar
method and thought back on my own
musical beginnings, [music]
I quickly realized that three very
definitive elements lay [music] at the
heart of my approach. These three
elements form the crux of self-contained
guitar and they are the fretboard,
the major scale, the triads.
From the crux, we can extract all of the
vital information required [music] to
make a sound beginning as self-contained
guitarists.
To not only know where each [music] note
is located on the fretboard, but to also
understand how those notes relate to and
interact [music] with one another are
indispensable tools that every guitarist
ought to wield confidently [music] in
their musical tool chests.
The Crux enables us to truly rely upon
ourselves [music] as we start building
the solo musical scenarios we crave.
The goal is to have the crux so
ingrained in our subconscious [music]
and our fingers that applying it to the
guitar is akin to simply taking another
breath of air. This however takes time
and effort. [music]
So let's begin
[music]
this notion of practice.
[music]
As you make your way through this
course, you will find that each chapter
contains finger [music] work and
paperwork exercises to be practiced on
the guitar or [music] written out on
paper.
Paperwork.
I strongly [music] suggest repeating the
paperwork studies in this course
numerous times as a form of ongoing
study. Physically [music] writing the
note names out and repeatedly seeing
them on paper will help further imprint
them in your brain. Trust [music] me,
you want that
finger work.
Though you are free to move [music] as
fast as you like, the fingerwork studies
are ideally suited to serve as regular
[music] long-term practices.
There is a lot of information in these
studies for your fingers and your brain
to process, [music]
so allow them the time to absorb it. Be
mindful as you work through each
exercise.
Since there is no actual time table here
other than the one you establish for
yourself, [music] please feel free to
move through the videos at your own
pace.
You are encouraged to pause [music] and
restart the video at any time in order
to focus on specific sections in greater
detail.
I would like [music] to stress that
mastering, memorizing or perfecting any
fingerwork or paperwork [music] exercise
is not required nor expected before
moving on to the next section of this
course. [music]
In fact, practicing multiple exercises
from different chapters simultaneously
[music] can actually bolster and
reinforce the material.
[music]
>> [music]
>> Chapter one, the fretboard.
[music]
Self-contained guitar revolves around
the comprehensive, intuitive, [music]
and intimate knowledge of the fretboard.
The fretboard is the very lifeblood of
any creative approach to using the
guitar as [music] a means of thorough
honest expression.
If we were to think of it in terms of
speaking a language,
>> which music very much is,
>> how could one form words without
letters, sentences [music] without
words, paragraphs without sentences? The
notes on the fretboard represent the
letters and words in the sentences and
paragraphs we form when speaking the
language of music.
So, let's flesh out what [music] exactly
a solid knowledge of the fretboard looks
like.
[music]
The 12 chromatic notes.
The 12 notes are spelled alphabetically
A through G.
seven natural notes and five sharps and
flats. [music]
A sharp or a flat occurs between every
note except B and C and E and F.
[music]
Sharps and flats are also referred to as
accidentals.
Though they have two different names,
notes like a sharp and B flat create the
same exact pitch and therefore count as
one note in the chromatic order.
[music]
The 12 notes are found all over the
fretboard. They occur everywhere a
string meets a fret.
In fact, each of the six strings of the
guitar represents its own row of
chromatic notes starting on a different
note with each subsequent string.
[music]
[music]
The notes simply start over once we
reach the 13th fret. [music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> half steps and whole steps.
[music]
The distance between each note is called
a half [music] step.
The distance between two notes is called
a whole step.
On the fretboard, one fret equals a half
step, and two frets [music] equals a
whole step.
[music]
[music]
For example,
A to B flat [music] is a half step.
C to D is a whole step. [music]
E to F is a half step.
B [music] to C sharp is a whole step.
[music]
[music]
Unison's and octaves. [music]
Unison's and octaves are two very
reliable ways to find notes as we move
across the fretboard.
A unison is the same exact note with the
same [music] frequency,
while an octave is the same exact note,
but in a higher or lower frequency.
[music]
Unison's are easy to spot by using the
54 determinator.
You can determine the unison of any note
on the fretboard by moving back five
frets [music] or four frets on the next
string down.
Move back five frets [music] when moving
down a string from the E, A, D, or B
strings.
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> Move back four frets when moving down a
string from [music] the G string.
[music]
>> [music]
>> Octave shapes.
Octaves can be found [music] by
referring to the very specific shapes
they form on the fretboard.
Low E to D. Skip [music] one string of
two frets.
A to G, skip one string, up two frets.
[music]
D to B, skip one string, up three frets.
[music]
G to high E, skip one string, up three
frets.
Low E to G, skip two strings, back three
frets.
>> [music]
>> A to B, skip two strings, back two
frets. [music]
D to high E, skip two strings, back two
frets.
[music]
Low E to high E, skip four strings, same
fret. [music]
>> [music]
>> paperwork.
Among the PDF files that accompany this
video series, you will find blank
fretboard maps with [music] both
horizontal and vertical views. Print
these blank maps out in [music] order to
implement the following two paperwork
exercises.
One,
start with a low E string and write in
the notes from the 1st to the 12th fret
on the blank [music] map. Then fill in
each subsequent string accordingly.
Remember where the sharps and flats
occur if you get stuck. Two,
pick one note and write its location on
every string from the first to the 12th
fret. Remember the 54 determinator or
the octave shapes if you [music] get
stuck. If you do not have access to a
printing machine, then I would encourage
you to draw out your own fretboard maps
by hand using the PDFs as a guide.
[music]
[music]
Finger work.
Dig out a guitar and practice finding
[music] the notes on the fretboard. Pick
one note and memorize its position on
every string between the first and 12th
fret. [music] Use the five4 determinator
or the octave shapes to get from one
string to the next. [music] Practice
playing that note on every string in
time with a metronome. [music] Go slow.
Allow enough space to make it to the
next string and still stay in rhythm
with the metronome. [music] Keep the
metronome dialed as low as possible in
order for this to happen comfortably.
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> Gradually increase the speed as the note
placements get more familiar.
[music]
>> [music]
>> Once you can play the note on every
string at a quicker, more comfortable
pace, [music] select another note to
memorize.
[music]
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
>> Chapter 2, the major scale. [music]
[music]
When it comes to understanding how to
make music from all of the chromatic
notes, [music] the major scale is where
it's at. In my experience, the major
scale is the single most important
element in creating music.
It's where every bit of harmony and
melody come from. [music] Who knew that
when a curious fellow named Pythagoras
hung a bunch of weights on different
lengths of wire back in ancient Greece,
we'd [music] wind up getting Louis
Louie.
The major scale is the map, the atlas,
the navigational tool by which [music]
we establish our sailing routes across
and through the unpredictable waters of
music. It is with the major scale that
we first [music] discover and then
extract all of those harmonious and
melodious gems from the deepest reaches
of our imagination. [music]
So let's dig in.
[music] The major scale formula.
The major scale is a diietonic scale
containing seven notes. [music]
The seven notes are determined by
following a specific series of whole
steps and [music] half steps from the
root or the one.
[music]
The major scale formula is as follows.
Whole step, whole step, half step, whole
step, whole step, whole step, half step.
[music]
When it comes to building a scale using
the major scale formula, C is a good key
to start with as it contains no sharps
or flats.
Since there is no sharp or flat between
E and F and B and C, these two spots
conveniently aligned with the major
scale formula which has half steps
between 3 and 4 and 7 and 1. [music]
[music]
>> [music]
>> Major scales must always go in
alphabetical order.
No letters are skipped and no letters
are duplicated.
This is how a note is determined to be
sharp or flat in a key with accidentals.
[music]
For example,
here is the key of G. The seventh note
would be F sharp rather than G flat
because you can't skip F, nor can you
have two G notes in a row within the
same scale.
[music]
Here's the key of F. The fourth note
would be B flat rather than A sharp
because you can't skip B. Nor can you
have two A notes in a row [music] within
the same scale.
Though there are no sharps or flats
between B and C and E and F, accidentals
can occur where they traditionally do
not exist.
[music]
For example,
[music]
in the key of F sharp, F becomes E
sharp. To keep things alphabetical,
there also can't be two Fs in a row.
[music]
In the key of G flat, we would have C
flat instead of B to maintain
alphabetical order.
[music]
We also can't skip a letter.
[music]
In addition to F# and G flat, this
concept also applies to the keys of C
sharp and C flat.
[music]
note.
Though they contain different note
names, B and C flat qualify as one scale
since both [music] are the same exact
key pitch-wise.
The same is true of F# and G flat
and C sharp and D flat.
[music]
Therefore, there are 12 major scale keys
as opposed to 15 [music]
[music] paperwork.
Among the PDF files that accompany this
video series, you will find this major
scale worksheet.
Write in the remaining [music] major
scale keys.
Look for any similarities, patterns, or
repetitions that may occur.
[music]
Major scale intervals.
An interval is the distance and pitch
between two notes.
Half steps and whole steps may get us
started, but the major scale establishes
a definitive set of intervals, which
lays the groundwork for the creation of
[music] chords.
Any
distance you travel from the root note
becomes an interval of its own. And that
interval derives [music] its name from
how far it is from the root.
Roote [music] to two major second.
Root to [music] three major 3rd.
Roote to four [music]
perfect fourth.
Roote to [music] five perfect fifth.
Root to six [music]
major 6th
root to 7 major [music] 7th.
Root to root octave.
Fourths [music] and fifths along with
unison's and octaves are considered
perfect due to their more stable sound.
[music]
[music]
While some intervals can be more
unstable or even dissonant like the
major 7th. [music]

allow you to familiarize yourself with

perhaps more importantly with the sound
of each interval as well.

[music]
>> Major scale fretboard patterns. [music]
Since we have 12 chromatic notes [music]
repeating on every string, the major
scale can be found everywhere. [music]
Though it is convenient to construct a
major scale on one individual string for
the sake of learning,
we can map the [music] entire fretboard
with the major scale
[music]
and break it into patterns that can span
three to five frets [music] at a time.
One pattern for every note of the scale.
Each pattern [music] derives its name
from the scale tone it begins with.
For example,
pattern four begins with F, [music]
which is the fourth note of C major.
[music]
Finger work.
Among the PDF files that accompany this
video series, you will find all seven
patterns of the [music] C major scale.
Beginning with pattern four, practice
playing each pattern on the guitar.
Start on the lowest note of each pattern
and play the scale in diietonic order,
ascending to the highest note and then
descending back down to the lowest note.
Then ascend from the lowest note once
more until you land on the root note of
each [music] pattern.
Pay close attention to the fretboard
finger assignments for each [music]
pattern. Be slow and deliberate at
first, saying the name of each note as
you [music] play it.
Alternate pick each note using the index
and middle finger of your picking hand.
Always notice where roots are located
within each pattern. Keep in mind that
these are interchangeable patterns that
will translate to all 12 keys.
and list the metronome to keep time.
[music] Count notes as eighth, quarter,
etc. and allow the timekeeping device to
dictate tempo.
Keep your body still other than your
fingers. [music] No foot tapping, no
head bobbing. This is a solid way to
develop a sound sense of rhythm. [music]
Once you've learned a pattern and can
play it comfortably and consistently in
time, move on to learning the next
pattern in the sequence until you can
[music] perform all seven patterns
smoothly.
[music]
The major scale patterns in this film
were recorded as eighth notes at 80
beats per minute.

>> The 12 major scale keys.
>> [music]
>> Here are the 12 keys written out in two
different sequences [music]
by fifths [music]
and by fourths. [music]
[music]
Traditionally, these two sequences are
presented as a circle of fifths or a
circle of fourths.
When going by fifths, we gain a sharp
[music] with each new key.
And those [music] sharp notes move in
fifths as well.
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
[music]
[music]
>> When going by fourths, we gain a flat
with each new key.
[music]
And those flats move in [music] fourths
as well.
[music]
[music]
[music]
>> [music]
[music]
[music]
[music]
[music]
>> Though the notes contained in each of
the 12 different scales differ from key
to key, the major scale formula itself
never changes. [music]
We can rely upon it to always deliver
the same results every time.
[music]
>> [music]
>> The challenge lies in not getting
blindly locked into the fretboard scale
patterns while losing sense of what
notes one is [music] playing.
Maintaining a healthy balance of major
scale comprehension and note awareness
allows us to attain the self-contained
[music]
guitar autonomy we're striving for.
>> [music]
[music]
>> Chapter 3, the triads.
[music]
Chords are typically the basis for every
guitarist first lovehate relationship
with the [music] instrument.
They pose quite a challenge with all of
those tough stretches. Yet, once we have
a few of those chords down, worlds open
up to us and we start strumming away
whether we know what notes we're playing
or not. But how are chords created and
where exactly do they come from? If you
guessed the major scale, then you
guessed right. [music] The fretboard
gives us the notes and intervals to
create the major scale. And the major
scale gives us the notes and intervals
to create the [music] chords. So, let's
jump in
and take a deeper [music] look at how
chords work.
>> [music]
>> Triad formulas.
Triads are chords that are formed by
taking specific intervals from [music]
the major scale and combining them with
a root note. Though there are no
accidentals within the major scale
formula, [music] these intervals may be
adjusted or altered by a sharp or a flat
in order to create triad formulas.
>> [music]
>> There are four basic types of triads,
each with differing chord qualities.
Major,
[music] minor,
diminished,
augmented,
major.
The formula for building a major triad
is as follows. [music] Root, major 3rd,
perfect fifth.
symbolized by single capital letter or
the abbreviation M AJ
minor
root flat 3r perfect fifth
symbolized by lowercase M or the
abbreviation M I N
[music]
diminished
>> [music]
>> root flat 3rd flat fifth
symbolized by the abbreviation D I M or
a small circle
[music]
augmented
root major 3rd sharp fifth
symbolized by the abbreviation a UG or a
plus line.
A flat third is also known as a minor
third.
A flat fifth [music] is also known as a
lowered fifth.
A sharp fifth is also known as a raised
fifth. [music]
When building a chord, any note you
start on is considered the root, [music]
regardless of what key you're in. If you
follow the root 3rd, fifth triad
formula, the subsequent notes will fall
[music] into their respective places
according to the root of the chord
[music]
[music]
paperwork.
Among the PDF files that accompany
[music] this video series, you will find
this triad formula worksheet.
Write out the notes for the various
unrelated [music] triads.
Feel free to use the major scales that
[music] you wrote out in the paperwork
exercise from chapter 2 as a visual
reference guide.
[music]
Chord voicings
>> [music]
>> A chord voicing is an arrangement of
triad notes on the fretboard. [music]
We will be taking a look at two types of
chord voicings commonly used in
self-contained guitar. [music]
Inversions
and bar chords.
The root [music] note does not have to
be the first note of a voicing. As long
as the notes of the triad are
represented, they can be arranged or
voiced in any order. [music]
This concept is found in inversions.
There are three types of inversions for
triads. [music]
Root inversion, root in bass.
[music]
First inversion, third in bass.
[music]
Second inversion, fifth in bass.
[music]
Though these inversions are determined
by which note is in the bass or on the
lowest pitched string, [music]
it is vitally important to be aware of
which note is on the treble side or the
highest end of the triad as well.
[music]
The treble side notes will be most often
referenced when matching [music] a
melody to the chords of an arrangement.

maps containing all four C triads
[music]
gathered into three string groups called
zones.
Zone one, [music] the G, B, and high E
strings.
Zone two, the D, G, and B strings.
Zone [music] three, the A, D, and G
strings.
Zone four, the low E, [music] A, and D
strings.

Practice playing each triad shape on the
guitar.
Play through the four types of triad
voicings, one zone at a time. [music]
Move up and back down the fretboard
within each zone.
[music]
Be mindful where root notes are located
within each voicing. [music]
As with the major scale, these voicings
are interchangeable shapes that will
translate to all 12 keys. [music]
Also, pay attention to notes that fall
on the treble side of the voicing
[music]
and list the metronome to keep time.
Count the triads as whole notes at
first, then work [music] up to half,
quarter, etc.
The triads in this film were recorded as
half notes at 80 beats per minute.

>> Bar chords are movable chord voicings
where one finger presses on multiple
strings across the fretboard [music]
while the remaining ing fingers form the
other applicable triad notes.
[music]
The bar chords utilized in
self-contained guitar are derived from
traditional E, A, and D chords. [music]
Despite containing more than three notes
in each voicing, [music]
bar chords still act as triads.
>> [music]
>> These major bar chords can become minor
by simply moving the major third back
[music] one fret in each voicing to
create a minor third interval.
We will be using bar chords specifically
[music] for major and minor triads.
Bar chords are played up and down the
fretboard according to where the desired
root [music] falls on the E, A, or D
strings.
For example,
these bar chords create three different
ways to play a C major chord. Root on
low E at the eighth fret.
root on A at the third fret.
Root on D at the 10th fret.
[music]
If we look at each of the three C bar
chords, we will find the three notes of
a C major triad. [music]
We can also dissect the bar chord shapes
and isolate some of the inversions.

the PDF files that accompany this
[music] video series, you will find this
bar chord worksheet. Using the E, A, and
D root bar chords, explore the various
ways on the fretboard to play the
chords. [music]
Remember to follow the root note to the
desired fret on the specified [music]
string.
For example,
for B minor, use minor root on the low E
at the seventh fret.
minor root on A at the second fret.
Minor [music] root on D at the ninth
fret.
Though memorization of chord voicings is
recommended, we want to be wary of
getting locked into shapes with no
mindfulness of the notes we are playing.
Set aside time to analyze the notes
within various voicings as you practice
them.
[music]
The harmonized major scale.
[music]
If we start with a basic C major triad
and move each of its notes through the
major scale as a group,
[music] we find that a new triad is
created for each scale tone. [music]
>> [music]
>> For example,
let's follow the C, E, and G notes of
the C triad through the scale sequence
on the fretboard. [music]
C moves to D, E moves to F, and G moves
to A. [music]
If we now consider D the root of the new
triad, D, F, [music] and A create a D
minor triad. Root, flat 3rd, fifth.
[music] Now move the D minor notes
through the scale sequence.
D to E, [music] F to G, A to B. With E
as the next triad root, E, G, and B
create an E minor triad. root [music]
flat 3rd fifth.
Let's move one more. [music] E to F, G
to A, and B to C. With F as our new
root, we now have an F major triad. F A
C [music]
root, 3R, fifth.
Following this sequential movement
through the remainder of the scale
establishes a distinct harmonic formula
known as the harmonized major scale.
>> [music]
[music]
>> In the context of the harmonized scale,
each note is assigned a specific
corresponding chord quality, major,
minor, [music]
or diminished.
The formula for the harmonized major
scale is as follows. One major. [music]
Two minor. Three minor. Four major. Five
major.
[music] 6 minor. 7 diminished.
[music]
Within the harmonized major scale,
triads are commonly notated with Roman
numerals.
[music]
No matter what major key we are [music]
in, these assigned chord qualities
remain intact.
[music] The 1, four, and five chords are
always major.
The 2, 3, and six chords are always
minor,
and the seven chord is always
diminished.

the inversion shapes can overlap and
connect across the fretboard to create
larger voicings. [music]

Count the triads as whole notes at
first, then work up to half, quarter,
etc. [music]

fretboard is a gradual long-term effort.

>> Chord progressions.
[music]
A chord progression is a series of
chords which can be used to establish
the framework of a song. [music]
Chord progressions are commonly taken
from or based directly on the harmonized
major scale
and as [music] such are identified by
their Roman numeral names.
Here are a few examples of common chord
progressions.
[music] The 145 is one of the most
widely used chord progressions largely
associated with blues [music] music. It
can also be found in a number of other
musical genres.
[music]
>> [music]
>> The 1625 is often heard in dooop music
or 1950s era ballads [music] as well as
in jazz compositions.
[music]
[music]
The 251 is an extremely [music] popular
turnaround in the jazz idiom.
[music]
[music] Of course, not all songs adhere
to the harmonized major scale or even to
one singular key. This is merely one
approach to analyzing chord [music]
progressions.

[music]
>> Studying and comprehending the harmonic
structure of songs can make arranging
for self-contained guitar much [music]
easier.
Suffice it to say, the triads can be a
handful, pun intended. But climbing
[music] inside of them and really
understanding where they come from, how
to form them, how they function with one
another, etc. can open up endless
[music] possibilities for the
self-contained guitarist.
[music]
[music]
>> [music]
>> This notion of practice,
[music]
time management is a key component to
effective practice. Here are [music]
some practical scheduling concepts to
consider when establishing a personal
practice regimen.
Create a schedule.
Establish the most consistent [music]
means of practice that suits your
schedule. 15 to 60 minutes per day
[music] is a great starting point, but
do whatever you can. Plan each practice
session and write out a schedule. Allot
specific amounts of time [music] for
each exercise you work on.
For example,
10 minutes for scales, [music] 10
minutes for paperwork, 10 minutes for
triads, etc.
>> [music]
>> Watch the clock. Set a timer for these
increments of time and switch to the
next exercise when each period [music]
of time ends. This can be challenging
because it may seem necessary to quote
master a specific exercise or passage
before moving on, but the effort we take
in self-contained guitar is cumulative.
Be consistent. [music]
Daily practice is ideal, even if it's
only 15 minutes. If practice is
impossible, [music]
make every effort to at least hold the
guitar every day.
Be flexible. It's great to have a set
practice time every [music] day, but
keep various possible practice times at
the ready so that when life or [music]
work responsibilities fluctuate, you can
still fit some practice in accordingly.
Mix [music] it up. Widen your scope of
focus to allow multiple bits of
information to sink in. Rotate [music]
the exercises you're working on as
opposed to repeatedly zeroing in on the
same exercise every time you practice.
[music] Here are a few unconventional
practice concepts that have proven
invaluable to my progress.
Relax.
Keep your body calm and [music] casual
and remember to breathe. Breathing in
time with exercises is hugely [music]
beneficial for relaxation and mindful
practicing.
For example,
playing a scale with the metronome at
any time. Breathe [music] in for an
entire measure and then breathe out on
the next measure. A breath [music] in
for four beats. A breath out for four
beats.
Continuing [music] that pattern through
the course of the scale.
Eat your vegetables first. Practice the
least appealing exercises first while
saving the [music] most enjoyable bits
for last. Once the challenging, healthy
parts are over, then it can be time for
some fun [music] musical dessert.
Television practice time.
Not all practice has to be intense and
focused. Practice can happen [music]
under any circumstances. Don't be afraid
to run exercises while doing something
mindless like [music] watching
television or listening to talk radio.
This is a great way of fooling your
brain and fingers until subconsciously
building muscle memory.
Non-practice [music]
time. Allow yourself as much
unstructured non-practice guitar [music]
time as possible. Make time to compose,
improvise, fool around, [music] etc.
Listen without learning. This may seem
obvious, but listening [music] to music
for the sheer pleasure of listening in
itself without analysis or [music]
transcription qualifies as practice.
And remember, you are what you listen
to.
[music]
It's very [music] important to keep a
balance of focused, discipline, and
light-hearted fun when practicing. Be
constant [music] in your effort, but
take care to protect and nurture your
joy of playing music. If you get overly
discouraged or if [music] you feel as if
nothing is working, take a break. Get up
and do something other than playing the
guitar for a while. Take a walk, [music]
eat some cashews, do a jumping jack or
two, then go back later [music] and try
again.

>> Hey everyone, welcome to this free codec
camp tutorial. My name is Taneska and
I'm a hat clubber from Georgia. Today
we'll be looking at cryptography. I know
all of you are here for some cyber
security action. So before we get into
our project or even touch Python, let me
show you something cool. This is a tool
called Cyershe. As you can see here, I
put in the words hello world as my
input. On my left, I have a lot of
different options in cyber security for
what I can do to this input. Right now,
I'm going to show you guys a hashing
algorithm called SHA 256.
Now for this input you see this random
string of characters that gets
generated. But now let me remove one
character. The output is completely
different. I add it back. It goes back
exactly to how it was before. This is
cryptography specifically hashing in
action. Today you're going to see how
you can hash text and files and check
their integrity in Python. how you can
do AES and RSA encryption as well as how
you can check the strength of passwords
in a more complex manner. And don't
worry, this tutorial is completely
beginner friendly, but a little bit of
Python experience will help. So, let's
get started. Before we dive into code,
let's go over some basics of what we're
going to build. Cryptography is
essentially the art of hiding
information. We're going to focus on
three main areas today. Hashing as you
saw earlier is a one-way transformation.
We also have symmetric encryption where
the same key is used to encrypt and
decrypt data. Advanced encryption
standard or AES is generally the go-to
method for this. Then is asymmetric
encryption. This uses a public and
private key pair. You encrypt with your
public key and decrypt with a private
key. Cybersh lets you experiment with
all of this before you write any code.
So, it's great for visualizing what's
happening behind the scenes and getting
a better understanding. We already got a
sneak peek at hashing with SHA 256, but
let's break it down some more. Here we
have multiple different options for the
size. So, we can do SHA 256, SHA 512,
etc. Um, these numbers tell you the
amount of bits, but again, 256 is
generally the standard and it is pretty
secure. With a hash, you're not going to
be able to get the input if all you have
is the output. But it is deterministic,
which means the same input is going to
map to the same output. There's just not
really a way to undo it. It also
demonstrates the avalanche effect. So
removing one character makes the hash
look completely different. This makes
hashes really useful in real life. For
example, when you download software,
websites often post an SHA 256 check sum
that you can compare against the hash of
what you downloaded to confirm that your
file hasn't been tampered with. For
example, this is from the official
NodeJS website and they've posted the
SHA 256 check sums of different download
versions. Now when I download NodeJS, I
can either use um terminal commands or I
can use software like I do like Win MD5
and I can check the hash of what I've
downloaded against these official check
sums to make sure that I downloaded the
correct file. Hashes are also used to
store passwords securely instead of
saving your actual password as plain
text in a database.
Next, we're looking at symmetric
encryption with AES.
So, here we have first the format of our
input and our output. Then we have some
new fields, a key, an IV, and a mode. I
prefilled the key and IV, but let's go
through what they mean. The key is the
secret password that AES uses to encrypt
and decrypt. Depending on the mode, it
should be 128 to 256 bits.
And in Cybersh we have the option to
provide it in either in any of these
formats. I chose UTF8 just because it's
easiest to show and explain. So I have
my key here. Then I have my
initialization vector or IV. This should
be the same size as the key. And it's
basically a random starting point that
makes sure every encryption looks
different even if the message and the
key are the same. For example, if you're
using a messaging app, um, every time
you send a message, it's going to use a
new IV so that even if you text the same
thing twice, the encrypted version never
looks identical and people can't encrypt
your messages.
So here, as you can see, I've encrypted
with this key and this IV, but now if I
change the IV, I get a different output.
And then finally, we have our mode. So
AES works on chunks of data called
blocks. And the mode decides how to
handle messages longer than one block.
Cybershift defaults to cyber
blockchaining. So each block of data is
kind of mixed with the one before it to
hide patterns. If I switch to ECB,
however, it'll encrypt each block
separately, meaning identical plain text
equals identical cipher text. This is
not very secure and it means attackers
can spot patterns easily. It's outdated,
not really used much. Other modes like
CTR and GCM are often used today. CTR is
used in network traffic. GCM is popular
for web encryption. So once I run this,
Cyershe shows me the the resulting
cipher text. And then I can also decrypt
it
by using the same key and the same IV
because again symmetric encryption uses
the same key to do both things. Let's
make sure we change our format to match
whatever we want to do.
And great, we now can see in our output
the same message that we inputed.
All right, let's switch gears from AES
to RSA to do our asymmetric encryption.
This one looks a little different in
cyershift because it uses a public key
and a private key instead of just one
shared one. So I have prefilled the keys
here because the math behind an RSA
algorithm requires really large prime
numbers. So normally 48 or 372 bits and
they do need to be mathematically
related. So you can't really make them
manually. I used an RSA key generator.
And again, public key and private key
have to make sure that they go together
and fit the correct size.
So you also see two new values here. The
encryption scheme and the message digest
algorithm which goes with this specific
scheme. This scheme adds randomness and
padding so that the identical message
gives different cipher texts. for this
specific scheme O O A which stands for
optional asymmetric encryption padding.
It also comes with this hash function
that we can choose from. So once I
encrypt my data, I get this weird output
and that's because the output isn't raw
binary data, but it's trying to show it
to us in UTF8 characters. To make it
more readable, I'm going to change it to
base 64.
We now see our encrypted output. Great.
Then we convert back from the B 64 to
our raw binary bytes right before we do
our decryption.
So for my decryption here, this is my
private key that I have copy pasted. Key
password is optional. We're not using it
in this case. We're using our same
scheme and the same hashing algorithm.
We've got our message back. So think of
RSA like this. Your public key is like
your padlock. It's something that you
can hand out to people. Anyone can snap
it shut on a box to encrypt a message.
But the private key is the only matching
key that can then open the padlock and
decrypt the message. Hopefully this
Cyerechef demo helped you understand
what we're going to be building in
Python in just a few seconds, how it
works, and why it's important. Before we
code, let's make sure Python is ready on
your computer. So, open your terminal or
command prompt and type in python-
version. If you see a version number
like I do, you're all set. If not, don't
worry because installation is very
simple. Just go to python.org/d
downloads and download the latest
version for your operating system. One
important thing, if you're on Windows,
while you're installing, make sure you
check the box that says add Python to
path before you install. This makes it
easier to run Python and pip commands
from your terminal. Then for your
editor, you can use any, but I recommend
VS Code. So to download it, go to
code.visisualstudio.com
and follow these specific steps.
Firstly, I'm going to create a folder on
my computer that's going to be storing
all of our code. I'm just going to call
it cyber toolkit. Then I'm going to go
to my VS Code. I'm going to open the app
folder that I just made
and I'm going to access the terminal
here. I want to work inside of a virtual
environment. So basically
um the main purpose of it is to prevent
version conflicts with packages and so
forth, but it's just a lot cleaner and
easier to work with. So in order to
create it, we're going to run the
command python hyphen mb
venb and click enter. Now, as you can
see, this folder has been created over
here that stores um scripts and so forth
that's going to make our virtual
environment possible. Inside this folder
is where we're going to be writing our
code.
Great. Now we know that it's finished
creating the environment when it comes
out and back to this file path
basically. So to activate our virtual
environment on Windows, I'm going to say
dot back slash venv back slashscripts
back slash activate.
Great. And now when we see this venv in
parenthesis in front of the file path,
we know that we are inside of our
virtual environment. On a Mac or Linux,
I believe the command is source.b
/bin
/activate.
So run this command if you have a Mac or
a Linux.
Great. So now that we are inside of our
virtual environment, we're going to
install a couple packages that we need
for our encryption techniques and the
password strength checking. To do that,
you're going to do pip install and then
the names of the library. So
cryptography
cxcbn
and then b crypt.
You hit enter. It's going to just take a
minute to install.
Great. So now all of it has been
successfully installed and we've come
out of the command.
I'm just going to make a sample file
here. I'm going to call it main.py.
And just for the fun of it, let's print
hello world.
And here just going to say run Python
file in dedicated terminal. So it's
going to open this file and run it. And
we see this hello world in our output.
If you don't have this run button, you
can also just go to the file, right
click and say run Python file in
terminal. That will do the same thing.
Awesome. Now the Python is all set up
and working. The code following this is
going to work the same regardless of
what IDE or OS you're using. So let's
jump right in. First, I'm going to
create a folder inside my virtual
environment that is called modules. This
is going to contain all the functions
that we use later in our main.py. In
modules, I'm going to make a file called
hash.py.
This is where we're going to be doing
all of our hashing. First, I'm going to
import the hashlib library. Then, I'm
going to try hashing a text string.
First, I'm just going to call it hello
world.
Now I'm going to create a hash object.
So once I do this, I'm going to call the
hashlib library and then call sha 256.
I'm going to say text.ccode
in order to get the hash value.
Now I want to show the output of my hash
in hexadimal. So I'm just going to say
hash digest equals I'm going to call
this object that we just created and
then call the hex digest function on it.
And then finally we're just going to
print out what we have so far. So the
sha hash of
our text
is
hash digest.
Awesome. And now you can run it in the
terminal.
And yeah, we're going to see our hash
right here. So now we've hashed a
string, but I want to hash full files.
So let's comment out this code. I'm
going to do control forward slash
because I'm on PS code, but in Python,
it's generally hashtags or triple quotes
to do comments. Then I'm going to use
the defaf keyword to create our function
called hash file. Here I'm passing in
the file path as a parameter.
>> [gasps]
>> Then just like we did above, I'm going
to create a hash object. This time I'm
calling the hashlib new constructor and
saying that I want to use the SHA 256
algorithm. Now I want to read our file
in chunks and then I want to hash each
chunk. So how do we read our file? We're
going to say open
file path and RB. This RB means read in
binary because again our hash objects
expect a binary.
I just want to reference this as file.
So I'm just going to say that. Then I'm
going to have a while loop that's going
to iterate through our file [gasps]
until our chunk becomes
an
until it's empty. That's what this
stands for. [snorts]
at which point I want to break the Y
loop. So first we're going to read our
chunks
by saying file read 1,024 stands for
1,024 bytes. And then
I want to update my hash object h with
each chunk. At the very end I'm going to
return h.hex digest so that whatever is
returned is hexadimal digits. Great.
Now, let's test this out. In my virtual
environment, I'm going to create a new
folder called sample files. I'm going to
make a sample.txt
file here. You can put in any you want.
We're going to go back to our hash.py.
We're going to test this. Now, for the
testing, I'm going to use this if
statement. It's going to say if name
equals equals main. And basically the
reason we include this is this if
statement makes sure that whatever code
we write inside of it only runs when
we're running this specific file. So
even when I'm calling on functions from
this file in main.py, whatever is in
here is not going to run.
So again, I just want a print statement
to make sure that our output outputed
correctly. So I'm going to say the sha
hash of file is and I'm just going to
call the function here hash file. And
now we want to get the path of this. So
we can either do copy path or copy
relative path
and this is this file path that we pass
in.
Now let's run this in our terminal.
Now, you might see this syntax warning
which just says this is an invalid
escape sequence. If you get this and you
want to fix it, just put an R in front
of your file path. Make sure it's
enclosed in quotations.
But again, you'll see that we get the
SHA hash of our file successfully.
Now that we've got the hashes, how do we
make them useful? Like I mentioned
earlier, hashes can verify file or
message integrity. And if you downloaded
the correct versions of things, even if
one single bit or pixel is different,
the hash will tell you. So let's create
another function right underneath hash
file called verify integrity.
Here for my parameters, I'm going to
pass in two different files.
This variable hash one is going to call
the hash file function that we just made
on file one.
Then hash two is going to call hash file
on file two.
I'm going to print which files we're
checking the integrity between. checking
integrity between file one
and file two.
You can use a new line here if you want
better visibility.
And now we're going to see if our hashes
are equal to each other. Then we will
return file is intact. No modifications
have been made.
Otherwise,
we're going to say,
or honestly, we don't even need the else
here because
when you return something, the function
will automatically stop. [gasps]
Otherwise, if we never get to this
return statement, it's going to come
here anyway. We're just going to say
file has been modified, possibly unsafe.
To demonstrate this, I'm going to upload
three image files to my sample files
folder in VS Code.
So, right in there.
Now, as you can see, L1 and L2 are
identical and T it has been rotated. So,
a couple things have changed.
Now inside this if name equals main I'm
just going to do print and I'm going to
call our function verify integrity and
we're going to copy paths again take
this
copy relative path
use the R again if you need to
and I'm going to get L2 and copy the
relative path here as well.
So this should return that no
modifications have been made because the
files are identical. Now for this next
one, the file has been rotated. So we're
going to take L1 again.
And for our second file, we're going to
take T.
Let's see what this returns. Okay, so
checking integrity between ORPS1 and
Orpius L2, no modifications have been
made, but between L1 and T file has been
modified, possibly unsafe.
That is awesome. You have finished all
of your hashing functions. We're going
to be moving on to symmetric encryption
next.
Inside your modules folder, make another
file called encryption.py.
We're going to import everything we
need. So, first is secrets. This is
similar to the random library, but it's
a little bit more secure. Then we're
going to import what we need for
symmetric encryption. So from the
cryptography module, so
cryptography.haznet.primitives
ciphers a
import
gcm. So AES encryption again our mode is
GCM. And then very similarly for RSA
primitives do asymmetric we're going to
import RSA and then the padding that's
needed for it. And then finally we're
also going to import hashes because we
use that.
Cool. I'm going to make my function for
symmetric encryption now and call it AES
encryption decryption. I'm passing in
message as a parameter and first I'm
going to make my key. So I'm going to
use secrets module to generate a random
key secrets token bytes. I want it to be
256 bits or 32 bytes cuz that is
generally very secure. And if you look
think back to our Cybershift demo, we're
going to have a non or in initialization
vector that is also going to be randomly
created from secrets token bytes this
time with size of 12 bytes. And then
finally, we're going to create our
encryption and decryption object. That's
going to be aes
GCM.
Then we're just passing in our key.
We're going to be using this AES object
in order to encrypt and decrypt now. So
first create a variable for the cipher
text. And I'm just going to use the
encrypt function. I'm going to pass in
my nons my message. And then for the
last parameter, which is additional
authenticated data, we're just going to
say none. Now, at the very beginning of
this, we're going to prepend the knots
as well. Um, remember this does not have
to be secret. It does not have to be
encrypted. We're just going to make sure
that we can use the same one for
decryption.
So, decryption variable called plain
text. Then we're going to call the
decrypt function first in order to give
it the knots. We're going to say cipher
text.
And then in the hard brackets, we're
going to say col 12. This means up till
12 characters.
Then we're going to do
after those 12 characters. So that's our
message. And again, none here. So this
is going to give you back your original
message in bytes. Oh, and the message
that we passed in is most likely going
to be a string. So we want to make sure
we do encode so that we convert it to
bytes.
Now, when we return our message, we
don't want it to be in bytes. That's a
little hard to read. So, we're just
going to return it as a hex string.
First, I'm going to return the key. And
then, I'm going to return my cipher
text. And then, finally, my plain text.
And again, this I want to be decoded so
that I can see it as a string just like
we inputed.
Great. So we're going to run the
symmetric encryption now just like we
did previously.
Call this if statement. So if name equal
equals main.
It's our standard Python entry point.
And I'm just going to print print
a cd. So we're calling the function. And
then pass in any string of your liking.
Great. Now let's run this and make sure
it works.
Okay, awesome. So here this is our key.
This is our cipher text. And then at the
very end we see our plain text.
Now let's move on to asymmetric
encryption with RSA.
Inside my function, I first want to make
my private key. Remember we use two keys
here. The public key generally encrypts
and then our private key is going to
decrypt. So from the RSC library I'm
just going to generate private key and
then pass in some pretty standard um
arguments. So public exponent and then
setting my key size to 148 bits.
Then for my
public key,
this is going to be extracted from my
private key. So I'm just going to say
key and then call this public key
function.
Great. Now let's get into the actual
encryption part of it. So going to make
the cipher text variable and then from
public key I'm calling encrypt. Now
inside encrypt I'm going to take two
arguments. The first is what I want to
encrypt. So that's going to be message
code because again it's passed in as a
string encrypts. This encrypts bytes.
And we also have a padding scheme.
I'm using the optimal asymmetric
encryption padding. So if you remember
from Cybersh RSA doesn't encrypt raw
data. It first pads this data using a
specific algorithm that we're going to
pass into this object. That's why we
import hashes. Then once that's secure,
it encrypts that data. So inside our
padding object, we're going to pass in a
couple arguments. First is the mask
generation function
and going to set the algorithm to
hashes.sha
256.
There's another argument called
algorithm. Again doing hashes.sha
256. You can also use SHA1 or SHA 512 if
you would like. [sighs]
And then I'm setting this field which is
used for associated data to none just
like we did for our AES encryption.
Great. So now we've finished our padding
configuration and encrypted the data.
I want to decrypt it into plain text. So
here I'm using private key. I'm calling
decrypt.
I'm passing in the cipher text because
that's what I want to decrypt. now and
I'm going to give it the same padding
scheme.
Now at the end
I will be returning
the cipher text as a hex string and then
plain text decoded into a normal string.
So in order to test this out let's just
say going to call the RSA function pass
in a string of our liking. Now let me
run this file.
Okay, great. So this and our symmetric
encryption and then here all of this is
our cipher text and then we finally get
our decrypted plain text.
Another critical aspect of user security
is protecting passwords. So let's create
a new file called password.py.
The first thing I want to do is a
function that's going to check the
strength of that password. In order to
do that, I'm going to import a function
called zxcvbn.
So from zxcbn, import cxcvbn.
Then let's get right to the function.
Check strength passing in password as a
parameter.
And I'm just going to call zxcvbn on
that password. Basically, what this does
is it returns an object which has
several properties about that password.
We're going to utilize score, feedback,
warning, and suggestions today. So, I'm
going to set a variable called score to
the score part of this object. This is
going to range from 0 to four. Score of
three or four is strong, otherwise it's
pretty weak. So, first
I'm just going to say if score is three,
we're setting our response to
strong enough password
score of three.
Al if it's four, we're just going to say
very strong password and score of four.
Now else if it is weak, we want to get
the feedback part of the result object.
So we're going to say result.get
feedback. And then from this feedback,
we're going to pull the warning and the
suggestions. So warning equals
feedback.get
warning and then suggestions
feedback.get
suggestions.
And I'm going to set my response to be
weak password
score of and
score is an integer here. We can only
concatenate strings. So I'm going to
make that a string.
And since it's weak, I also again want
to display the warning and the
suggestions. So to my response, I'm
going to add
warning. This backslash n makes a new
line
display the warning and then something
very similar for suggestions.
Now one thing to keep in mind is that
suggestions are given in a list. So we
cannot directly concatenate like we did
here. Instead I'm going to use a for
loop. I'm going to say four suggestion
in suggestions
response plus equals
and each suggestion separated by a
space. Great. And at the very end I'm
returning response.
Let's run this function. So I'm again
going to do my standard entry point. if
name equals equals main.
And here I want to utilize a while loop
because basically I want the user to
input a password until it is strong
enough in which case we'll break out of
the while loop. So I'm going to say
password one equals and this is a user
inputed password. Now instead of using
input like normal, I want to use get
pass so that our passwords aren't shown
in plain text. So at the top we're going
to do from get pass import get pass.
Then I'm calling get pass. Here I'm just
going to say enter a password to check
strength.
Then I'm going to call my check strength
function
passing in password one as an argument.
And then to make sure they get prompted
again, I'm going to say if this function
starts with so if what is returned from
this function the response starts with
weak. So remember this starts with weak
this starts with strong and very strong.
If it starts with weak,
I'm going to print please choose a
stronger password.
And then it's going to go back to this
input.
Otherwise, we're going to be breaking
out of the while loop.
So, let's test this out.
Um, I'm first going to enter a pretty
weak password.
It's got a score of zero. You have my
warning. No warning here. And then
suggestions. Please choose a stronger
password. So now I'm going to do
something that's pretty strong. And I
get that it is strong password. I don't
see a warning or suggestions here.
We just finished checking the strength
of a password. But now I want to
simulate storing it as well as verifying
it to provide or deny access. In order
to do this, we're going to import one
more library called VCrypt. And we're
going to use two functions. So first I'm
going to hash my password.
We're passing the password in as a
parameter. And first I'm going to
generate a random salt. So this is a
unique sequence of bytes that we add to
our password before we hash it. Um just
so that it prevents patterns similar to
the RSA padding. So in order to generate
this salt, we're going to call brypt.
Gen salt.
Then
to actually hash the password with the
salt, we're going to call brypt.ash
pw. This is the brypt hashing algorithm
passing in our password in bytes along
with our salt. And we're going to return
hashed.
Then we want to verify the password.
I want to first pass in the password
attempt. So what the user is inputting
as well as the hash password which is
what would actually be stored in a
database.
So I want to check if they match. And to
do that I'm going to call another brypt
function. If brypt check password
password
attempt
encode we want to do it in bytes against
hashed.
So if this is true then we're going to
return
password is correct
access granted
otherwise I'm going to say
incorrect password
access denied.
Great. So now let's run this right after
we check the password strength. So once
our user has inputed a strong password,
we're going to hash that password.
That might be a little confusing. I'm
just going to name it hash password. I'm
calling the hashpw function and passing
in this password one.
And then just so we can see what we
have, I'm going to print out our hashed
password.
But again, because it's hashed, no one
can make sense of it.
Then we're going to ask them to reenter
their password to verify.
And finally, I'm just going to call the
verify password function
with [snorts] the attempt as well as the
actual hashed password that we have
stored and then print that out. So,
let's test this.
I'm going to
first enter a weak password
again. We see our warning and
suggestions. I'm going to choose a
stronger one now.
And then I'm re-entering it correctly.
And yeah, our access is granted. This
function and file is working. Well,
this is the bulk of our cryptography
toolkit. We hashed text. We hashed
files. We verified them. Then we did
symmetric encryption and decryption with
AES, asymmetric encryption, decryption
with RSA, and then password strength
checking as well as hashing and
verification.
But we still have to put it all
together. So let's come out of the
modules folder and go to this main.py
file. We're going to be importing all of
our functions and making a simple
command line UI.
Let me make this file empty. And then
I'm going to do from modules.hash.
I want to import hash file as well as
verify integrity. We're going to do
something similar for all three files.
So for modules encryption imports
and then RSC
and finally modules password import
check strength hash password and then
verify password. Great. Next I'm going
to create a function called menu. This
is just going to print out a list of
options for the user. Going to say
select operation
and then we're going to give them a
couple different options. So first I'm
going to say hash file.
Next number two check file integrity.
Number three,
AES encrypt decrypt.
Number four, RSA encrypt decrypt.
And then finally, the password manager.
If they want to exit out of the menu,
we're going to have an option called
zero where they can exit.
Great. Now that we finished the menu, I
want to print a welcome message to all
users when they first run the file.
[snorts] And I pre-wrote it because mine
was a little long.
So I'm pretending that they are an agent
and they are basically on this cyber
security mission.
Now, what I want is for our users or our
agents to basically see this menu, pick
an option, interact with that, and then
go back and choose as many operations
from here as they would like. In order
to implement that first going to make
this while loop the very top, we're
going to call this function to display
the menu.
And then we're getting an input from the
user
asking them for which operation they
would like to run.
So if our choice is zero,
then we want to break out of this while
loop. That's what we have here. Now
otherwise if our choice is one, what are
we doing? We're hashing a file. So we're
getting a file path as input from the
user
and then we're going to run the function
and print it out. So I'm just going to
say sha hash of file
is
and then run the function.
Great. Now if our choice was two, let's
see what we have. We're going to check
file integrity.
So, we're going to get two file paths
this time.
And we're going to call our verify
integrity function
with both of those file paths.
Cool. Now, moving on to the third
choice.
we have our symmetric encryption and
decryption. So for this I first want to
get a message as input from the user
and then I'm going to encode it because
for encryption decryption we like to
work with bytes.
[gasps and sighs] Then from my function
if you remember here we're returning the
key the cipher text and the plain text.
I want this to be displayed in a good
format. So I'm just going to store them
in variables here. So key certext plain
text equals
and then call that function. These are
the values that are returned to us. And
I'm just printing out AES key,
AES cipher text,
and then AES plain text.
Cool. Now we'll move on to our fourth
option
which is going to be RSA encryption
decryption. So we're going to get a
message as an input again.
And this time if we look at our RSA
function, we return the cipher text and
the plain text.
So
I'm just going to store those in
variables. cipher text plain text and
call the function.
Then I just want to print out the cipher
text. I'm say RSA message encrypted with
a public key.
And similarly I'm going to say for
decryption our same message decrypted
with a private key
show the plain text.
Now for our final option option five
this is our password manager. So, if we
go back here, we kind of just want to
run exactly what we have here. So, I'm
just going to copy
and paste it. Um, let's fix our
indentation.
And we need to import the get pass
module. So, let's just go up to the top
and do that. Awesome.
Now, if they're choices are not from 0
to 5,
let's just be safe and then print in
valid choice.
Great. So now this Y loop is going to be
functioning exactly as we intended.
And very end
after we've come out of the while loop I
just want to print this exiting message
say agent you are exiting your
cryptography
toolkit
stay sharp and secure out there
all right let's just look over this ones
I just realized that the message that we
pass in here in our function s we
actually pass that in as a string and
then encode it into bytes. So in this
case we don't need to do the encoding
here. Otherwise we're passing in bytes
instead of a string and that's probably
going to cause an error. Other than that
everything looks fine. So let's test it
out and make sure that it works as
intended.
All right, great. So we see my welcome
message here and then our menu. Let's
just go in order and check
each
operation. So I'm going to copy path and
great I got the SJ file of it. Now I
want to check integrity. So I'm going to
give two file paths.
So one of this
and then
let me copy path
one of that. So these should be
different.
Let's see. So, it tells us file has been
modified, possibly unsafe.
Now, let's try again with files that are
identical.
L1 and L2. Yeah, files intact. No
modifications have been made. All right.
Great. Our third one, symmetric
encryption and decryption.
Entering a message.
Awesome. We see our key. Okay, we see
our cippher text and then back to plain
text. Um, I'll do the same one with RSA.
Okay, we see our huge encrypted message
and then the plain text decrypted again.
And then finally, let's try out our
password manager. I'll give a bad
password this time.
Okay. And then a strong password.
password is correct. Access granted.
We're back to our menu. Now, let's just
say I want to exit.
And we are all done.
Now, I just have to say congratulations
for building your own cryptography
toolkit in Python. But this is only the
beginning. You can expand this project
with the web interface using Flask. You
can encrypt folders and implement
digital signatures. You can work with
authentication and storing passwords in
a real database and so forth. The most
important part from this video is that
you now understand how these pieces fit
together and you're excited to learn
more with tools like Cyershe. Remember,
cyber security doesn't have to be
boring. It is going to be the future.
So, thank you so much for tuning into
this video, and I hope you learned a"

and Blender. This beginnerfriendly
course is your ultimate guide to
crafting an immersive 3D portfolio,
blending artistic vision with technical
skill. You'll begin by diving into
Blender to learn the fundamentals of 3D
modeling. With your 3D assets complete,
you will learn 3JS to bring your 3D
models to the web. You'll develop the
programmer's mindset for analyzing and
applying complex code examples. By the
end, you'll have a unique interactive 3D
portfolio and the knowledge to
confidently build your own creative web
experiences. Andrew won't develop this
course. In this video, we're going to
create a crossy road and voxil/blocky
sort of theme portfolio. We've got
collision detection. We've also got some
interactions like when you click on
Pikachu, he jumps really cutely. Um, and
this is kind of like amplified, sorry,
like copied to some of these other ones
like Bulbasaur here and Charmander as
well as Squirtle. Then on the back here,
we also have some projects. So, you can
click on them and kind of just read
about the projects and then you can
visit them if you want to. And you also
have some other hidden gems for more
information. Uh, just some playful
personality things. And uh, of course,
we also need the Crossy Road Cameo, our
biggest inspiration right here. So, this
is actually a portfolio I was working on
with a friend. So, I just recreated it
to for this intro course. So, this intro
course is going to cover a lot of
things. We're going to cover some
exercises. We're also going to cover how
to read documentation, how to think like
a programmer, how to how to figure out
things that seem difficult, how to break
down things. So hopefully it'll give you
the right mindset. So you'll eventually
won't need as many tutorials and you can
kind of figure things out on your own.
So you don't need any experience with
3JS or Blender whatsoever. But you do
need some experience with HTML and CSS
and JavaScript. If you can make like
static websites, if you can make static
websites, like if you just go to a
typical static web page and you're like,
""Okay, I can make that."" Then you should
be good to go. Yeah. So I just want to
make like a brief comment about creative
web development or the title. So it's a
very very broad term. Um it's very very
broad and there's a lot of other terms
that you might hear. So you have like
creative technologist, UI engineer,
UI/UX engineer, UX engineer, design
engineer, graphics programmer, 3GS
developer, WebGL developer, creative
developer. You know, creative web
development has so many many many many
job titles and in all those job titles
they overlap very often and you know
people are going to specialize in one
area compared to others like some people
are really into like CSS and JavaScript
animations. Uh other people use no code
tools for like motion design like after
effects or like jitter which is a online
tool or principle. Others are focused on
like low-level language stuff with
shaders and GLSL.
Others are more focused on Blender.
Others are focused on the UI design part
with like Figma and things like that.
So, when you enter the creative web
development field, there's so many
niches and areas to specialize on. When
it comes to these terms, I generally
don't like to define myself within these
terms. At the end of the day, you're
just someone that creates something
really cool. So you should view yourself
as someone that creates something.
Whether you do UI design, whether you do
shaders, whether you do 3D art with
Blender, whether you do CSS or
JavaScript, you're all doing something
and creating something that makes other
people happy. So the moment you start
slapping labels on yourself like design
engineer or creative developer and all
these sort of things like they're cool
to kind of describe the work that you do
but don't let it subconsciously limit
you on what you think that you can do.
Uh often I see that designers will say
that they're designers and they think
that they can't code but then they later
find out they can code. Or people that
code they're like I'm a coder I can't
design. and then they find out later
that they can design. So, you know,
don't view these as like separate
concepts. View them as you just creating
something that's really cool, whether
you're designing or whether you're
coding. Over time, as you explore these
different areas, you'll kind of find,
you know, what sticks with you and what
interests you the most and then you can
start specializing while still being
somewhat of a generalist. So, my area of
focus or my specialization is definitely
around 3D art with Blender. So that's
why most of my videos on this channel
kind of include Blender on them. The
really awesome thing about the creative
web development field is that you kind
of can blend yourself into a multitude
of different roles outside of the
creative roles, right? Like if you know
Blender and you actually don't like
coding, you can just transition into a
3D artist at that point. Or if you like
coding and you like shaders and you like
3D art and and I think I said
programming then you can become like a
game developer or something like that.
Or maybe you're like okay I like 3D art
and animation so maybe you become like a
animator who's also into music theory
and music design and things like that.
And then maybe you're eventually, you
know, instead of just working with
websites, you go into like AR and VR and
all that kind of cool stuff as well
because you have 3D knowledge, you can
contribute to AR and VR even though
you're just primarily programming with
the web. Additionally, all your skills
and like if you have like UI design
skills, it's going to help you if you
want to do become a UX researcher and
understand how users use your website
and things like that. You know, you can
translate all these concepts between
every single field, right? If you know
how people view 3D art conceptually and
the theory behind that, you can
translate that to your 2D UI designs.
And then if you become a UX researcher,
you kind of already build up that
intuition across multitude of art
fields, which will make you better when
you're doing things like heristic
evaluations. So the really really
awesome thing about creative
development, creative web development in
general, is that you can kind of mix and
shape your career however you want and a
lot of skills really really overlap. So
that's kind of why I really really like
it. And you kind of never get bored
because you can always just like quote
unquote switch your specialization or
learn something and use what you learned
to build upon the knowledge of the other
domain that you learned previously. Um
so I think it's really really cool and
uh yeah. So without further ado, let's
get started. All right. So let's create
a new general file. So this looks a
little bit scary. They all look kind of
weird and kind of scary and that's
totally okay. But there's one way to
visualize this 3D scene that will make
it a lot easier not only with 3GS but
also in Blender.
So just like the real world when we are
working in the real world we have
certain things that we need in our scene
right so we can categorize this whole
thing this whole picture as some sort of
scene. So you can think of this point
light like a light bulb and the icon
kind of does look like a light bulb. And
then right now we have a cube but we
could make some flowers right and then
we would have flowers in the center of
our scene. Uh but now we would just have
a cube. So you can imagine a cube here
and then here this is our camera. And
then just like in real life this is a
camera here. So yeah essentially what
you're looking over here is just
something that you can visualize in real
life just like here.
So now let's navigate around a scene,
right? Like in real life, you can walk
around. So, how do you do that? Well,
you can use your middle mouse button,
uh, just click down on it to rotate your
camera. Then, when you hold shift and
use your middle mouse button, you're
going to be doing this action called
panning. Another thing you'll see me do
a lot is zoom in and out. And you can
just scroll up with your middle mouse
button and down like so. Or if you're on
a laptop, you probably have to use two
fingers. You can also hold control or
command on Mac and hold down your middle
mouse button to do a smoother kind of
zoom. But for the most part, I usually
just use my tick scroll with my middle
mouse button. I should have also
mentioned that on the bottom here,
you'll see the things that I'm hitting
and some of my mouse inputs, like when I
left click and things like that. Not
everything shows. Like I'm hitting my
middle mouse button and it's not really
triggering that as well as it should be.
But yeah, in case I don't mention
something, which I'll try my best to,
uh, try and look here a little bit and
if you can't find it, uh, just post a
comment below and and I'll take a look.
So, spend some time just using your
middle mouse button and then randomly
clicking shift sometimes to navigate
around your cube. So, now I'm going
underneath the cube and then I'm going
back all the way at the surface. And
this will feel really, really weird at
the start. Um, but over time you'll kind
of get used to it. If you're on a laptop
without a mouse, you probably have to
use two fingers to rotate and then hold
shift and two fingers to pan. All right,
so before we continue, let's come up to
file and save or just control S or
command S if you're on Mac. And let's
just call this Voxal Portfolio, but you
can call it whatever you want. And let's
just save it here. All right, so let's
make some adjustments to our cube. Let's
say we want to scale it. We can hit S on
our keyboard to scale it and then we can
lock it on specific axes. So you can see
if you come up here you can see the
specific axes here. So the green one is
Y, the X is X and the Z is up and down.
So we can scale it with S. And then we
can hit Y to lock it on the Y axis and
then we can hit X to lock it on the X
axis or Z to lock it on the Z-axis. Then
you can leftclick to confirm that
transformation. And now you can see our
block looks more of like a rectangle.
Additionally, if you wanted to do all of
them except a specific axis, you can do
like shift Z. So now only scale along
the X and Y axis but not the Z-axis. The
next thing you have is G to move it if
you want to move it. So G in this case
stands for grab. And same like scale,
you can move it along a certain axis
just by pressing that letter like so.
And you can also do shift shift Z and so
on so forth. And you can just change
between these until you left click to
confirm it. So now my cube is over
there. The last one that you'll need to
know is rotate. So if you hit R for
rotate, you can see my object is
rotating. And similarly, you can do RZ
and now it's only rotating along the
Z-axis. R Y, it's only rotating along
the Y- axis. And RX, it's only rotating
along the X-axis. You'll notice that
what you see the dotted line from your
cursor is relative to this orange dot.
And this orange dot appears on every
single mesh that you have. And this is
what we call the origin point. All of
your transformations will be relative to
this origin point. You can see now since
the origin point is exactly in the
center of the object, when I hit S to
scale it is kind of evenly scaling the
mesh. Now watch what happens when I
change the origin point. You don't have
to do what I'm doing. I'm just going to
show you. If I move the origin point
over here on this side and confirm that
change. Now when I scale it, you can see
it's scaling from here. Isn't that
really interesting? So when I do S Y,
you can see it's kind of going like this
instead. But when I do RX, it's kind of
rotating like this instead of the center
of that object. So I'm going to undo
that origin point. Now when I go back
and do RX, you can see that just like
that. So I'm going to leave that undo.
But that is an important concept to
know. Yeah. So, pause the video, take
some time, just play around with your
cube, mess it up, do whatever, and also
get comfortable navigating and doing all
that sort of stuff. So, generally before
3D artists start modeling whatever
they're modeling, they kind of have an
intuition on what sort of quote unquote
basic shapes that sort of complicated
thing that they want to model is made
of. So, when I mean basic shapes, you
can add a shape. If you do shift A, you
can see you can come to mesh. There's a
variety of different objects here. But
if you come to mesh, this is kind of the
one that you're mainly going to be
working out of. You can see we have a
bunch of primitive shapes, right? We
have a sphere, we have a plane, we have
a cube. So cube is what they gave us by
default. Uh we can also add something
like a plane. So when I click on that,
you can see that there's a plane there.
So let's just move this cube out of the
way. And now there's a cube here. And we
can do the same thing like we did the
cube. S to scale it. Y and so on so
forth. And then I can also shift A again
and then come over here and look for a
sphere. And now you can see we have a
sphere in there. And we can do the same
thing. S scale it R rotate it. So on so
given all these basic meshes and objects
and shapes, adjusting them will give us
the model that we want. All right. So
let's take a look at what we're
modeling. We're going to be modeling
this tree as our first object. Now,
unfortunately, we only have a 2D image,
so it's kind of hard to visualize all
three worlds. But if you take a chance,
you can kind of see what kind of objects
it's made out of. Like, let's say this
really small stem here. What do you
think this is made out of? Well, it
seems like it's just a cube, right? So,
it's like a cube and then we just
stretched it really long and this would
be our branch sort of thing, right? And
you would be correct. It's just a cube
that we scale up in the Z-axis.
Same thing with this sort of thing right
here, right? We just have a 3D cube.
So if I draw this, you can see we
probably have a cube something like
this, which means that this is also a
cube. And then this is also a scaled up
cube as well. So by analyzing the basic
shape, we realize that we need four
cubes. One cube for the trunk, one cube
for the bottom bush, one cube for the
top bush, and one cube for the very top
bush. So, I'm in a new Blender file, but
here's your first optional task before
we continue on. And this is what I call
the think like a 3D artist intuition
development exercise, which is kind of a
long-winded way of saying when you look
at a real life object around your house,
try and think of what sort of object
would make that. So, let's say we have
this water bottle here. So, what could
this be? Well, it kind of looks like a
cylinder. So, do we have a cylinder? If
you do shift A, go into mesh. Indeed, we
do have a cylinder. So, we could
possibly also use a cylinder for this
one right here. What about this one?
Well, it kind of looks like a sphere,
but it's like half of a sphere. So, do
we have a sphere? And yes, indeed, we
have a sphere. Later, I'll show you
instead of just transforming the object,
I'll show you how to actually edit the
object. But this is going to be your
first intuition. It's like, oh, that
could be a sphere. And then this kind of
looks like a cylinder. So if we wanted
to make a bowl, uh, so if we wanted to
make a bowl, we could just move this
cylinder up here and kind of scale it
down just like this. And then we kind of
already have the beginnings of a bowl.
And then for like a fence that you see,
oh, it looks like a bunch of cubes that
I just scaled up and scaled down a
little bit. So yeah, just spend some
time looking at your objects around you
and things around you and try and see,
you know, what sort of objects, if you
could edit them in some sort of way,
could they be made out of? And this is
how you develop your 3D artist
intuition. And again, don't worry if you
mess up. Over time, this will get better
and better, and you can grow and learn
from your mistakes. So let's do that.
I'm just going to select one of these
objects. And holding shift, you can
select multiple objects. So, I'm going
to select all of these
while still holding shift and left
click, and I'm just going to hit X, and
I'm just going to delete them. So, let's
add our first cube. So, I'm going to do
shift A. I'm going to do cube, and I'll
add a cube here. So, I'm just going to
do exactly kind of what this looks like.
So, I'm going to scale it down, right?
And I want to do shift Z this time. So,
I just want to scale it on the X and Y
axis to kind of get a stem looking
trunk. And then I'm just going to do SC
and I'm going to scale it up just like
that. Now, if you don't like the angle
that you're working with in the
viewport, there's these things called
orthographic views that help out a lot.
So, if you come up to this gizmo over
here, you can see that when I click on
this thing, it's going to only look at
the other axes. And this is what we call
an orthographic view. Basically,
everything is the same distance from the
camera. So, you don't have to do this,
but let me just take this object here.
And I'm going to do gx and move it
really, really far away, right? And it's
kind of obvious that this is farther in
the distance, but look what happens when
I go in the positive x-axis orthographic
view. It looks like it's exactly here,
right? And then if I do gx, it's
actually moving along the x-axis, but I
can't tell because I'm in an
orthographic view. So the benefit of the
orthographic view is sometimes you don't
know which objects are taller or
sometimes you don't know which objects
are wider. So you kind of want to quote
unquote get rid of an axis and only pay
attention to what you need. So let's say
this object, let's say we move it up
here and then we would have to try and
find an angle to determine if this one
is longer or this one is longer and it
would be kind of a mess. So instead what
we just do is go to an orthographic
view, right? And just by eyeballing it
in this orthographic view, we can tell
that they're the same length.
Additionally, it helps us align things
better here. Imagine we had to align it
here. We would kind of have to guess
this looks about the same level, right?
But then if I go to the orthographic
view, you can see it. We got pretty
close, but it's not as easy as it would
be if we just did an orthographic view.
So, let me just delete that. And that's
kind of So, these views are really
helpful. And now you can see that if you
have a numpad on your keyboard, that's
really helpful to quickly jump uh to
like the side view. You'll hear people
say left view, right view, positive
Z-axis, right? So you can highlight over
these to see the shortcuts for them.
Okay, so let's add our cubes. So I'm
going to do shift A and instead of
coming here, you can just type cube. So
I'm just going to type cube and hit
enter. So if we go to our reference, we
see that we have this stick, right? And
then each of these is about 40% I would
say of that stick. So let's do the same
thing. Uh again, if you want to scale
this down a little bit and move it up.
So you can totally do that. And then I'm
just going to move this down here. Maybe
S, shift, Z a little bit, like so. Now,
instead of adding another cube, since
the top the middle bush is going to be
the same size as this one, we can
actually duplicate it. So, the way to do
that is with shift D. And then, by
default, it'll be selected. You can
right click to cancel the movement, and
then it'll just place it in place. Or,
let me delete that. If you do shift D,
since it's already in the grab or the G
move command, you can automatically lock
it on the Z-axis. And then you can just
click up and drag and left click to
confirm it. Just like that. So we can do
the same thing for the top bush. We can
do shift D, lock it on the Z-axis, move
it around here, and just scale it down.
And then maybe this time we want to
scale it up except on the Z direction,
and kind of just place it just like
this. Then let's move this down a little
bit. Yeah. And congrats. If we look at
it, we pretty much made this tree,
right? So if you made this tree, you can
definitely make variations like this
tree. Now, we did successfully create
the tree, and it looks fairly similar to
the one in the image, if not identical.
But there's kind of a few other things
that I want to show you to speed up your
workflow later down the road. So, you
can just watch for now, but I want to
talk about some of the issues with our
current model that will be a headache
later down the road if we don't fix it
now. So, let's say we don't like the
size of our tree. Well, you know that
holding shift, you can select multiple
of them. When you select multiple of
them, you can actually perform
operations on them together. So, they'll
all scale at the same time. They all
rotate and so on so forth. You can also
box select. So, you can left click and
drag to select everything in your view
like so. You can see it's collecting.
You can see it's selecting like so. And
that'll be okay to scale the tree,
right? But what Blender is doing for our
tree here is that it's taking the
average of all these origin points, the
center of them, and scaling it like
that. So, what if our tree was like
sitting on a plane or something? So,
again, you can just watch, but let's say
I add a plane for our ground and it's
our tree is like sitting on this plane,
right? So, we select all our tree
objects and like, oh, that tree is too
big. So, we decide to scale it down. So,
we scale it down. Now, look what happens
when I go to the side. Now, we have to
move it all the way down here and then
just like, oh, no, that's too small. So,
then we go up here and we have to kind
of do like this. Right? Now, that's not
terrible, but when you're working with
multiple objects and doing the same
thing over and over again, that's going
to be really, really annoying. So, one
way to fix that, instead of having to
select all the objects at once, is to
join them together so they become one
single object. So, if with all of them
selected, the one with the strong orange
outline, which we generally call the
active object, that origin point will
become the entire object, entire joined
objects new origin point. So since this
is the last one, if I do Ctrl + J again,
you can just watch. Now you can see it's
all one single object, right? And if I
hit S to scale, it's going along that
origin. So if I select all of them
instead, and then still holding shift,
make this one the active object and hit
Ctrl + J, you can see the origin point
is now along here. So what if somehow we
had our origin point down here? That way
when we scale it, it'll be relative to
our ground. That way we wouldn't have to
move it anymore. So you can actually
adjust this origin point. If you hit
control period or if you're on Mac
command period, you'll see that you get
these axes. And then what you can do is
just G and Z. And you can see that it'll
be moving that origin point. And you can
just put it at the bottom here, right on
the center. So here's where you would
want to use orthographic view to make
sure that you really get it there. Just
like this. Cool. And now you just place
it at the bottom. And now to confirm
that just do control period or command
period if you're on a Mac to get out of
that mode. So now look what happens when
I scale it. And now you can see even
when I go to the side, even when I make
it big, we don't actually have to make
any movement adjustments at all. So now
your origin point might not be placed
perfectly there, but you kind of see the
concept that we're going for, right?
Okay. So I'm going to do something to
get back to where we were. Uh you can
just watch. I'll explain this a little
bit later.
So the second issue with the model is
that we have a bunch of overlapping
geometry. So when you have a simple
scene, uh generally this is not a issue
at all. And if you're just going for
like renders and things like that, it's
not always a big deal. However, for us
this is a particularly a issue. One
primarily because of texturing which
I'll cover a little bit later. So you
can just ignore that now for now. And
then the second thing is the browser is
very very weak compared to like Blender
software or game engines or like when
you download a game onto your computer,
right? The browser isn't as strong. So
the issue with overlapping geometry is
that we're pretty much wasting
information. No one will ever see this
cube behind this other cube, right? So
what we have is this extra information
that no one will actually ever see. And
then let's say we want a color there.
Well, we would save that color data in a
file, right? But if no one sees it, then
that's just extra space into our file.
And then for the web, we kind of want to
control for this as much as possible.
So, there's a few ways to fix this. One
way is to bring the model out of it,
right? And kind of keep it a little bit
gapped there. Or there's this feature
thing on here called snapping. And you
can choose a variety of snapping methods
like face in this case. So, if I do G,
you can see it's moving along this face
of that object. And then if I do Z to
lock it on Z-axis,
you can see it's only snapping to this
face. So, now it's perfectly sitting on
top and it's not overlapping. Let me
turn this off. So, that's one way to fix
that. So, let me hide this cube. You can
do that with H, or you can come here to
the scene outliner and click this
eyeball here to temporarily hide it. If
I come down here, yes, we don't have
overlapping geometry, but we still have
this huge square here that will be
storing information like colors and
things like that. So, we don't want that
either. So, I'll talk about how to fix
this in a little bit, but let's rehide
our cube and let's take a look at how we
can optimize our modeling so that we
kind of avoid all these issues. So, what
I'm going to do is select everything and
hit X and delete it. Okay, so let's
analyze this top bush before we start
modeling because this is the one that I
want to do first. So, we kind of had two
issues with this top bush. One, these
two cubes were overlapping each other.
We fixed that, but then on the
underneath of the top cube, there was
still a face there that was taking up
information that we didn't need.
Additionally, it looks like these two
are connected. So, given all that
information, is there some way we could
create a cube and edit that cube in
order to make this top thing rather than
add another cube? And the answer is
actually yes. So, what I'm going to do
is shift a search and add a cube. And
then if you come up here, you can see
this thing called edit mode. So, now
when you go into edit mode, you're going
to see some more things show up. And you
can leftclick box select, select
multiple, and so on so forth. So, what
we're in right now is verticy select.
And then you also have edge select. So,
when you go over here, you can click on
the edge. And then when you click over
here, you'll select a face. And when you
go between these modes, which you can
change with your numbers, your number
keys at the top of your keyboard, you
can see if I hit one, I go into vertex
select. If I go in two, I go into edge
select. And if I go three, I go into
face select. So, kind of just get used
to that. Depending on the mode that
you're in, your transformations are
going to affect your object in different
ways. So, here I'm in face select. You
can see when I hit G to move it, it's
kind of different. When I go into vertex
select, I can select a verticy, hit G,
and you can see what it's doing to my
object. And then I can select multiple
with holding shift, just like the same
way we can select multiple objects,
right? Same with box select and and so
on so forth. Just get used to switching
between the modes and just like seeing
what you can do with your cube. Uh, and
then just have some fun. Now, it would
be kind of annoying if you always had to
go into object and edit mode just like
this. So the hotkey to switch between
object and edit mode is just tab. So you
can see as I hit tab I'm going between
object and edit mode. Now I don't like
tab being this hotkey primarily because
I use a lot of other things in blender.
So what I like to do if you come into
sorry if you come into edit preferences
and go to keymap you you can see this
thing here called tab for pi menu and
this is what I have checkarked and what
it shows when I hit tab is the two modes
here but all the other modes that I can
quickly access. So if I just do tab edit
mode tab object mode you can see it I
can just go back and forth just like
that. If you prefer the default way of
Blender, you can totally do that. And we
won't be using any of these other modes
in this video. But as you start using
other modes, I really recommend you to
turn on the pi menu. All right, so let's
just go back into object mode and delete
this cube and add a new one. And let's
go back into edit mode. Thing to do in
edit mode is what we call an inset
operation. So what an inset does is it
kind of takes your selection and tries
to make that same exact shape but just
smaller. So if I select this face, if I
go into face select again, you can hit
three there or come up here and click
it. So I'm selecting this face and I hit
I for the inset operation. You can see
that it's kind of making a smaller
version of that face in in here. And you
can if you don't like the speed of it,
you can hold shift to make it go a
little bit slower slower. Just like
this. You can also type numerical values
if you want to, but I'm just going to be
eyeballing it. So, like the photo, I
think it was about here. So, we can just
left click to confirm it. Or if you
want, right click to cancel it. But I I
want to confirm it. So, I'm going to do
left click arbitrarily around here. And
then, like the other faces, you can
scale it if you want to. So, I'm hitting
S and I'm hitting G and I'm hitting R.
All those operations are still working
as well. Now, we don't want to rotate it
or move it at all. We just want to bring
it up. But if we bring it up, it kind of
does this, right? And that's kind of
weird. So that brings us to the second
really common edit transformation, and
that's called extruding. So if hit E for
extrude, you can see by default, it's
going to lock in the axis direction that
you're extruding in. Uh so in this case,
it's extruding to Z, but you can hit Z
to unlock it and it'll extrude up. But
we just want to do directly up. So now
you can see I can just bring it up, uh
eyeball it, and just leftclick to
confirm. Just like that. And now, guess
what we have? We have a connected object
here. We have no overlapping geometry.
And if you want to, you can select a
face, press H to hide it. You can see
there's no hidden face here. So if I do
alt H to to unhide those things, you can
see that we do indeed when I go back
into object mode have our top bush.
Okay. So let me delete this. And the
next the next thing I want to talk about
is the trunk origin point. Right. So let
me add a cube. Again, you can just
watch. You don't have to do anything.
Let me add a cube. And let me just
quickly make our trunk. Let's just say
this is our trunk. So, remember, we want
our origin point to be at the bottom of
the tree trunk. That way, when we change
things around, it's not going to mess up
anything. I did show you one method. If
I select it, do control period, and move
it down with GZ arbitrarily here, it's
going to be perfectly fine. Again, we
can turn on snapping here and do GZ and
just snap the origin right over here and
to the bottom and then hit control
period to confirm that and everything is
perfectly fine. Another alternative is
to use what we call this thing right
here, the 3D cursor. So, if you want to
change where it is, it'll be shift
rightclick and you can see I'm changing
its position around the world. And when
I do shift A and add a cube, you can see
my cube is now added over there instead
of the world origin. So the 3D cursor
has a lot of other uses. We can also use
it to set the origin point. So if I go
into edit mode and I select this for
things like this and do shift S, you can
see we have a lot of options related to
our selection as well as our cursor.
So if I do selection to cursor while
select So if I do cursor to selected,
it'll take my cursor and teleport it to
my selected things. So since I selected
this face, what it's going to do is take
the average of these four vertices or
this face since I'm technically also
selecting the face. It's going to put it
directly at the bottom of this face as
well as the center. Then I can go back
into object mode and do object set
origin origin to 3D cursor. Obviously
nothing changed because we it was
already there. But this is the other
alternative of setting an origin point.
The other alternative of setting an
origin point is actually adjusting the
model. And if you go into edit mode and
hit A and move it around, notice that
the origin point doesn't change. Whereas
in object mode, the origin point is
adjusting with the model. So essentially
what you could do is kind of place it in
edit mode. Let's assume it was up here.
You just place it here in edit mode and
go into object mode and it'll be
working. Now what if I told you there
was an even faster way to set the origin
point to the bottom of this tree trunk.
So let me delete this. And it's actually
not a way of setting the origin point,
but per se using the right sort of
starting mesh. So instead of using a
cube, I'm going to use a plane. Whoops.
Let me actually delete this. I just want
to start from the origin. Not that it
matters. I just like it. So, what we can
do is shift S. We can do cursor toward
origin. It'll snap right back there.
Now, let's do shift A and add a plane.
So, now look at this plane. The origin
point is directly in the center of this
plane, right? Which looks exactly like
when we had a cube, the bottom face of
that cube. So, now what we can do is
just go into edit mode. And we learned
about extrude. So, what we can do is
just extrude it up, right? Hit A to
select everything and then shift C and
scale it down just like this. And then
go back into object mode. And you can
see that voila, we have a tree trunk. We
didn't have to adjust the origin point
or anything. We just had to extrude it.
So if you do it really quickly, it's
just shift A, add a plane, go into edit
mode, E, extrude, A, S, shift C, just
like this. Whereas again, if you add a
cube. So let's do the same thing. Add a
cube. So, let's turn on vertex snapping
this time. Control period GZ. Uh, snap
it to this vertex like here. Um, control
period to confirm it. S, shift Z like
so. And then now it's not at the world
origin. So, just move it here and just
do shift S just like this. So, yeah.
Yeah. So, the plane is significantly
easier, significantly less amount of
steps. So for our case, using a plane is
actually better than using a cube when
it comes to a tree trunk. Yeah. So for
when it comes to a tree trunk, at least
for us, we actually want to use a plane
instead of a cube. Okay. So the next
operation I want to talk about is loop
cuts. So again, we have to go into edit
mode for hits. And if you hit control or
command R, you can see you get this
yellow line thing here. And this is what
we call a loop cut. Basically, what it
does is it gives you more geometry by
slicing quote unquote slicing your mesh.
So, if you use if you scroll up or down
on your mouse or laptop D-pad, you can
see you can add the number of slices.
You can also type it. So, if you hit
nine, you can see it's going to give me
nine there. For us, I'm just going to
add two. And then when you left click to
confirm it, you can see it'll start
sliding. And then you can right click to
make it centered. So it just be
centered. Or if I do Ctrl + Z, get rid
of those. Let's do Ctrl R again. Go up
to two. You can decide where you want to
place them. And since again they're just
like any other edge or any other vertex
verticy. You can see as I switch between
them, I can like select the face in
between them now just because we sliced
it up. So if you want to select a loop
cut really quickly, you can hold down
the alt key and you can see it'll select
that whole loop there. So now when I do
G and Z, you can see I can also move it
just like this. Now the reason I'm
showing you a loop cut here is because
again we don't want extra geometry. So
if I go back to this tree here, you can
see this trunk kind of goes in between
them. And again, that means that trunk,
that invisible trunk is using some sort
of information that we don't really need
because we'll never see it. So, by using
this loop cut, we have more geometry
here to work with. So, if I go into face
select and hold down alt, you can see
it's going to select that full loop
there. And I hit alt E, it's going to
give me this alternative extrude menu.
You can also come up to face and see
these extrude options here as well. But
generally I just use alt e and you'll
see this thing called extrude faces
along normals. So what normals are, it's
like a direction pointed off of the
face. Generally it's perpendicular.
Meaning if this face is directly up and
down, the normal is going to be pointing
90° from this face. So like 90°. So
it'll be pointing that way. Same thing
with this face. It's kind of looking
outward. So, it's going to be 90° and
it's going to be pointing that way. So,
if I do alt e extrude along normals, you
can see what happens,
right? This face is 90° is going this
way. This one's going this way and so on
so forth. So, what we have now is our
tree, right? We have the base, we have
our trunk, and we also have the tree.
All right. So, again, if I hide this,
you can see we have no geometry in
there. Now, it's kind of tedious to
always have to hide something in order
to see something else, right? Because
sometimes you might forget that you hid
something and you kind of just wondered
what happened. So, if you hit Alt H, uh,
it will unhide that. So, there's these
things in Blender called modes. So, if
you hold down the Z key, you can see we
have a rendered mode, a material preview
mode, and a wireframe mode. So, if we go
into wireframe, you can see now we can
see through a mesh. And this is a really
quick way of just looking through your
geometry without having to hide
anything. We'll talk about these other
two in a little bit. But let's go back
into solid. You also have this thing up
here called X-ray view. So when you
click on it, you can also see through
your object. And if you come here, you
can see there's some options for your
X-ray and how much you can see through
that and so on so forth. Now, the really
nice thing about like X-ray or wireframe
is that when you select things, you can
actually quickly get the things behind
that you can't see. So, if I go into
edit mode here and I go to verticy
select and I box select here, you can
see I select all four. Now, let me
deselect that by clicking somewhere, go
into solid view and do the same exact
box selection. Look what happens when I
go on this side. I can't see that
verticy, so I didn't select it. And I
can try as much as I want to. I can even
select this back one here because I can
see it, but I'm not touching that one.
So, I have to come over here, hold
shift, and select this one and deselect
this one by holding shift and clicking
on it. So, now I select everything. But
instead, what you can just do is go into
wireframe box select and select all
those, right? Just like that. So, these
views are definitely going to help out a
lot. Now again just like holding tab I
also like to come into edit preferences
key map and to this thing called extra
shading pi menu add items. Now when I
hold Z you can see we have we have this
thing called toggle overlays and toggle
X-ray. So if I go back into solid view
instead of coming up here to toggle it
or using the hotkey alt z I can just
come here and do toggle x-ray just like
this. Okay. So now I can delete this.
And what I want you to do is pause the
video and try and recreate the tree
using everything we know and then come
back and return to this video. All
right, so let me show you how I would
make my tree. Okay, so the first thing I
would do is add a plane for our tree
trunk. Scale it down arbitrarily.
Go into edit mode and extrude up. Again,
this bypasses any transformation we need
for the origin point like so. Then what
I do is go into edit mode and add three
loop cuts like so. And I'm going to go
into wireframe, select these bottom two
and SZ to scale them up a little bit. In
this case, SZ is effectively doing the
same as if I highlighted one of these
and do GZ and move them up. And this is
going to be our bottom bush. So I'm
going to do is SZ and kind of just
eyeball it. And then GZ and kind of move
it somewhere over here. Then I'm going
to go into face select. And since they
were already selected, I don't have to
select them. But again, if you
accidentally deselected it, you can do
it with alt and click near the edge and
it'll select that whole loop again. But
since we're in wireframe, we can just
box select and it'll also do effectively
the same thing. They kind of have the
same size as the top one. So, what I'm
going to do is I'm actually going to
select this loop cut right here. And I'm
going to GZ and move it down a little
bit like so.
Kind of eyeballing it as well. And what
I'm going to do is face select this with
alt, right? Get all these. And then I'm
going to hold shift and alt and select
this loop right here. Again, since we're
in wireframe, we can just hit hold down
shift and left click and drag to select
through our object. So now what I'm
going to do is do alt t extrude faces
along normals and just move my mouse up
until I get a tree shape that I like.
Super super cool. And then now for the
top bush. This is belonged to our trunk
originally. But now what you can see
that it's effectively like an inset
face. So what we can do is select this
face and just scale it up to the size of
the top bush. And then we need a top
bush. So, what we can do is just E and
extrude it up, right? Oh, sorry. I have
snapping on. Let me turn this off. And I
did right click, cancel, but I still
have to extrude. So, it's kind of
overlapping. So, make sure that you
don't actually accidentally do that.
Anyway, since it's overlapping, I'm
selecting it anyway. So, I can just do
GZ and bring it up a little bit to get
our top tree. Just like that. So, let me
go back into solid view. And voila, we
have our tree. Except this time, we did
it well. You can see there's no
overlapping geometry, no wasted
geometry, and our origin point starts at
the bottom. Super super cool. All right,
so let's rename our object. We can come
up here, and you can see it's called
plane. Or you can click on it and just
hit F2 and you can rename it here. Or
you can come over here to the outliner
and double click here. And I'll just
call this tree. Then we can temporarily
hide it and move on to our character.
Okay. So, you can use whatever character
you want, but I'm going to be going for
like a kind of a human kind of
character. So, just by looking at Crossy
Road's uh character, you can probably
see that you you can actually make a lot
of these. Even this default chicken,
sorry, the image is a little bit blurry,
but you can see we kind of have a cube
here, and then the body is a cube,
right? And then a loop cut, and then you
can extrude out the head. And then this
is also probably just a single cube
extruded this way and extruded this way.
Top also a cube or it's an inset and
then an extrude up as well. Same thing
with the feet. You can see probably a
cube or a plane starting there extruded
downwards. A loop cut on the side, a
loop cut on the side and then extrude on
that side, extrude on this side at the
same time. And if you can make this
character, you can probably make this
character or this character and so on so
forth. Now, there are some techniques
that would probably speed up the
workflow for a lot of these, which I'll
show in a little bit, but let's take a
look at some of the human characters of
Crossy Road. But when taking a look at
one of these characters, you kind of see
that for the most part, they're kind of
just made out of a bunch of cubes,
right? So, the body is probably like a
cube or plane again. And then, you know,
same thing down here and so on so forth.
Okay, so before we move on, I kind of
want you to do a drawing exercise. Even
if you're not good at drawing at all, I
kind of just want you to like visualize
the side view of your object. So let's
say this is your head and then this is
like your body or something and then you
have your legs and they kind of look
like this and then you have your arms
right here like so. So this is like the
side view of your character and then you
can imagine the front view. So, like we
have something over here and then it'll
kind of be like this, right? This is the
body. This is the neck. Uh, these are
going to be the arms like so.
And then these are going to be the legs.
And then we have the feet like so. Like
so. So, whatever character you're doing,
try and just either in your head or
actually draw it out, you know, kind of
visualize what primitive objects you
need for your character. All right. So,
let's start a character. I'm going to
shift A and add a cube. And then I'm
just going to bring it up. If you want a
thinner head, you can definitely scale
it down. Uh if you prefer working this
way, you can totally do that as well.
It's not really a big deal. I'm going to
leave mine a cube. And now we need a
neck. So there's a few ways to approach
this. And it kind of depends on you. So
one, you can use the method we learned
already. You can just hit I to insert it
and then maybe S and S and Y just to
make it a little bit thinner and then E
to extrude it. So there we have our
neck. For the body, you can do the same
thing. You can E, but instead of
extruding down and then using alt E to
extrude along normals, which you could
totally do if you wanted to. So if I do
alt E and do like this, that would give
us our body, right? And that wouldn't be
too bad. And then of course you can
scale it how you want it and shape the
body. So that's one way to do it.
Extrude and then extrude again along the
normals. Or what you can do is E and
then right click to cancel the movement
and then scale it up first to get a
shape that you want like so. And then
you can extrude it downwards like so. So
you get the same exact result, just two
different methods there. And then
there's this third method that you might
be using a lot as well. And this is what
you'll see a lot when it comes to
objects that should be separated. And
you're kind of like preemptively doing
that in your own brain. So what you can
do is click on something here and do P.
And you can see it brings up this menu
called separate. And you can separate
that mesh by selection. So right now we
only have a cube and our tree that we
hid and that point line in camera. But
watch what happens when I do P and
separate by selection. You can see I can
no longer select that thing because it
became its own object. So if I go back
in object mode, you can see now I have
two separate objects. And you can rename
this one as well. It has the same name.
So it automatically tagged on that ID
there of one. But now you can see it's
its own separate object. So since it's
own separate object, I can just scale it
up. I can just scale it up. But notice
that its origin point is at the default
object's origin point. So again, we know
how to fix that. Blender, we don't have
to do all that fancy stuff. We can just
come up to objects at origin, origin to
geometry, and it'll try and take that
average of that geometry and place the
origin point there. So now we pretty
much just have a plane that's sitting
right there. We don't have to add
another one. It's just right there. So
that really helpful because now we can
just scale it up, right, and shape it
how we want. and then go into edit mode
A to select everything E and bring it
down. But now we have kind of two
objects here. There will be a lot of
scenarios where the P separate by
selection rather than combining the mesh
is going to be the method that you take.
For us it's not particularly going to
matter that much. Now obviously like we
did before you can join them. So Ctrl +
J and then now you can see we have one
object. If we go into edit mode you'll
see that it's not connected though. So
essentially what we did, we actually
saved out a little bit of geometry,
right? We instead of having these lines
for inset, right? We don't have those
anymore because they're separate
objects. They effectively look like
they're joined together, but they're not
joined together. See up here, if I move
this, these are joined together. Whereas
down here, there's no join at all. So if
I do this other thing called A and do P
separated by loose parts, you can see
it's going to give us our two objects
again. So couldn't we also do it with
the head and the neck, right? Why do we
have the neck and head connected? Well,
honestly, it really depends on your use
case. Like, let's say you're animating
the head and do you want it to affect
the neck? The reason I'm showing you
these different methods is so later down
the road, you won't be kind of surprised
when you see them. So, let me just
quickly delete all of these and start
again. Shift A, add a cube, bring it up.
And this time, I'm going to do the P
separate by selection method. Go into
edit mode, select this. I'm going to
shift D to duplicate this face. Right
click, cancel the movement. It's still
selected. So P separate by selection.
And now go into object mode. Select it.
Right click. Set origin. Origin to
geometry. Scale it down for the neck. So
S Y something like this. Go into edit
mode. A to select everything. E to
extrude down. And now I'm going to do
the same thing. This is selected. P
separate by selection. Now that becomes
its own mesh. Again, same thing. Right
click. Set origin. Origin to geometry.
Scale it up a little bit. Just get the
body like so. A to select everything in
edit mode and bring it down. So now you
can see I have three separate objects
here like so. And instead of having to
hide this and see this face here,
there's this thing called local mode. So
if you hit the backslash on your numpad,
you can enter local mode where you only
see the object there. So if I go back,
you can see it hops between those. You
can also go to view and oh, I I should
have mentioned you can also see the
orthographic views in the viewport. But
yeah, you can also come here local view
and do to toggle local view and you can
see the hotkey is numpad slash. But then
you'll go in there and then you can just
come back here and remove from local
view and so on so forth. I should have
also mentioned that there's a lot of
other really awesome things that you can
do to quickly navigate around your scene
that you can see in these menus. I
highly recommend check one that I like
to use a lot is period key on my numpad
and that kind of just jumps to your
selection. So in in the view menu it's
just frame selected. So you can see
frame selected. It'll just jump to
whatever selected object you have like
so. So now if I wanted to name this, I
would have something like head. All
right. And then I would select this. And
then I would something like neck. And
then I would something like body. And
again uh if I go here, you can see we
will never see this face. So we can
actually just delete it. Go out of local
view and so on so forth. Now if you want
to reset the origin point for all of
these to be in the center, you can
quickly do that by selecting both of
them. Set origin. Right click. set
origin origin to geometry and that will
calculate the centers for both. So now
that we moving on to the legs, you can
actually realize that maybe we actually
did a good option here. So if I go into
edit mode, you can see I can just add
two loop cuts, right? Like so. Just like
this. And go out here and just extrude
these down. Add a add two more loop
cuts. Right click cancel. Left click,
right click, cancel. Hold shift and alt.
Select both of these loops. Or wireframe
and box select. Whoops. We don't want
those. Just those. and then GZ and move
it down. Whoops. I accidentally selected
that. I can hold control and box select
to quickly deselect as well. Move that
down. Face select and E and extrude over
here. So, if I go back to solid view, we
kind of already have our thing started.
Same thing here. We can add our arms,
right? And so on so forth. But now
before, so I'm going to undo all those
changes. Now, let's take a look at if we
did the other way. So, again, sorry I
keep going back and forth. I just want
to make sure this is really really
coherent.
But here, I'm just going to do the same
thing. I'm going to insert. I'm going to
extrude. I'm not going to spend too much
time uh styling it the same way. But
then same thing here. Uh e extrude,
right click, cancel. Scale it up. Uh e
extrude it down. Wireframe. Bring it up
a little bit. I don't want it too messy.
Okay. So, now that we have this method,
which if I put more time into would look
identical to this, right? But look what
happens when we want to add our legs. If
I had a loop cut like two, you can see
what happens. It slices through our
entire thing. So while effectively we
would get the same exact thing, right,
that
this method did, what we're adding here
is all these extra lines.
So obviously what you could have done is
at this neck point in you could have
separated that object. So the neck and
body could have been extruded together
which is okay. Whereas you separated the
body which is what we did over here. And
now you can see it's just a simple clean
cut just like this. So for us yeah the
top doesn't really matter if you decide
to insert or not. Whereas the body
choosing to separate it actually really
benefited us a lot. So I'm going to
delete this and we should be good to now
go here. But it's kind of tedious that
since the legs are the same and since
the arms are the same and since all this
stuff is the same, it's kind of annoying
that we have to do it all over and over
again. So, Blender actually has these
things called modifiers and they're like
functions that basically do things to
your objects that speed up your
workflow. So, if you come to add
modifier, there's a lot of really really
cool ones and one of them is called the
mirror modifiers. Again, like adding a
mesh, you can just start typing and
you'll see mirror modifier right there.
And you can hit enter and select it.
And you won't see anything right now
because it's just mirroring it on top of
itself. Watch what happens when you add
a mirror object. So, I'm just going to
take this eyropper tool and select our
head. And we still don't see anything
because it's along the X-axis. Watch
what happens when we do it along the Z.
And you can see what happens is it's
perfectly mirroring across the origin
point of this object equally spaced onto
the other side. So we can just get rid
of this just to see it's equally spaced
over here or the graphic view. Just H to
hide it. You can see what it's doing
there. Now it can also mirror across
itself. So let's get rid of this and
let's go into a body. And what I'm going
to do is add a loop cut straight down
the center. Right click and cancel that
so it's straight in the center. and then
select these vertices
like so and hit X and just delete those
vertices. Right? So, so now we just have
half our body. But then we can do add
modifier, come over here and search
mirror, right? Just like this. And now
you can see if I go into edit mode and I
change one thing on this side, it's
going to mirror that change on the other
side. We also want to turn on clipping.
And this will kind of prevent our stuff
from going through each other. So if I
do GX, you can see they're kind of like
clipping or going through each other. So
we want to turn this on. And I want to
do GX. You can see it's not going to go
anywhere. And then we also turned on
merge by default, which means once we
apply this modifier or it finalizes our
transformation, these vertices will
merge instead of overlap each other.
What we're technically doing is what we
call procedurally modeling. That means
if we want to, we can come back and
change this a little bit later. very
very simply compared to compared to if
we were just hand modeling it which
people generally refer to as destructive
modeling. So think about it this way. If
I go back into object mode and hit
control A to apply my modifier or I can
come up here and do apply. Now if I go
into edit mode you can see we no longer
have the mirror modifier. So if I
extrude here it's not going to do
anything over there. So this is what we
call destructive modeling because now it
just becomes a lot more tedious to edit.
But if I leave in the mirror modifier,
go into edit mode, this is more
procedural because if I want to change
things, right, I can change things. I'll
talk about procedural and destructive a
little bit more, but I kind of just
wanted to briefly bring that up. Yeah.
So we have a lot of options now. We
could add a loop cut here like we did
for the thing and just extrude our legs
or we can do the separate meth method.
So I'm going to do that. I'm going to go
into solid view. I'm going to select
this face. Shift Duplicate. Right click.
Cancel. P separate by selection. And now
you can see we have this separate object
here. And since it came from an object
with a mirror modifier, it also has a
mirror modifier here. So I can go into
edit mode and just E and extrude it down
a little bit like so. And this will kind
of be our belt. So we can call this belt
like so. And then what we can do is the
same exact thing. Go into edit mode.
Select this. Shift Duplicate. Right
click. Cancel. P separated by selection.
And now these will be our legs. So we
can do legs. Go into edit mode. And this
time we don't want our legs to be the
full width. We kind of want a gap there.
So what we can do is turn off clipping
this time. So we can move it and do GX
kind of like so. Again I can go into
wireframe to do this. Now I can just
select all these and do E and extrude it
downwards like so. And then we can do
the same thing here. Uh, I'm just going
to extrude the feet this time, but you
can totally separate it for the shoes as
well. And now, if I go back, you can see
we have our legs, a belt area, our body,
our neck, and and so on so forth. And
then, of course, make sure we don't have
any extra stuff. So, we can go in here.
Uh, yeah, we kind of have some stuff
here. So, we can delete these
like so. Uh, same thing with the leg, I
guess. Over here, we can delete these.
No one's going to see those. Now, if you
want to edit like the size of this belt,
then you'll need to select all three of
them. Go into edit mode, go into
wireframe, select all, and then select
all these top ones and do SZ, for
example. So, you can scale all of them
at the same time and adjust it that way.
GZ, that kind of stuff. So on so forth.
And then, of course, if you don't like
this, you want to make this a little bit
longer, you can totally do that as well.
Again, you didn't need to have a
separate belt and legs. if you just
wanted to loop cut and extrude and you
totally could have done that as well. So
yeah, you totally have so many options.
Uh honestly, just play around to get
something that you like. That's all I'm
going to be doing. Okay, now we need to
add our arms. So lots of ways to do
this. If you wanted to use the cursor
method, which is something we learned
way back, if I do shift A and add a cube
here, you can see that is going to add a
cube here. GX and then maybe GX a little
bit again and snap it over there. So,
that's a really quick way if you just
start. Let me just show you. If I add a
cube here, I scale it down a little bit
and I do GX and try and snap it here.
I'm holding control, by the way, to
quickly toggle this on. Even though it's
not showing it, I have vertex on. So,
it's going to snap to a vertex. It's not
going to it's not going to work.
Whereas, if I move it out a little bit
first and then do GX and then snap it,
you can see it's going to do that. Of
course, you could also use a plane and
rotate it 90°. Um, but yeah. So this
time I'm just going to go out a little
bit. Maybe come over here and extrude
this a little bit like so. S Y whatever.
And then now the really cool thing is
again we can add a mirror modifier. So
we don't have to do that. And this time
we can use our object as our body. And
now you can see that we have this little
thing here. And every change we make on
this side, it's going to happen on that
side as well. Super super cool. So you
have that method and then you also have
like that duplicate method. So, shift D,
right click, cancel. P, separate by
selection. It becomes its own object.
Then you can go to edit mode. A select
everything. S, shift X, just scale it
along the Z and Y axis. Go bring it up a
little bit. Edit mode. E to extrude it
out. Um, R loop cut like so. E, extrude
it down. Just like that. So, same same
exact thing there. Yeah. So, you have a
lot of options. Honestly, for for the
arms, it doesn't really matter which
method you choose in this case. Um, it's
not going to change much at all. And of
course, you can edit it how you want to
edit it. Uh just make sure you're
selecting the things that you want to
select. Um and and do it like so.
Super super cool. So now we can rename
this F2. And I'll just call this arms.
And then of course you have the other
ones. You can add a loop cut and
extrude, right? Or you can do an inset
and extrude. So you can do an inset,
bring it up here, and extrude like that.
So on so forth. So many options here.
Okay. Okay, so the last thing I want to
do is add some hair to our head. Now,
there's a lot of approaches here. So,
you can just watch for now and then
based on what you want to do, I
recommend trying and figuring out which
method might work best for you. So,
let's say you want a simple haircut. You
can just add like a loop cut over here,
right? And then you can just select this
with holding Alt or maybe the top one as
well and just do alt extrude along
normals. So, now you kind of have like a
simple hat or something. And then I
guess if you wanted to, you could insert
this and bring it up. And then instead
of hair, you'd have a hat there. Uh if
you wanted to make it hairy, you could
maybe add another loop cut here and
select this loop with alt and then hold
shift alt and hold
select this loop. And then select this
loop. And then also this one as well,
like so. And then you can do alt e
extrude along normals. Now you can see
it's kind of uneven. So maybe you like
that. But you can also you can also hit
S to make it scale evenly when you're
extruding along the normals. So you can
move it up a little bit. And you can see
we kind of have like a Elvis Presley
sort of haircut here. And of course, you
can always make adjustments here like GX
and kind of so on so forth. And again,
if you don't want to extrude it from the
head, you can totally separate this by
selection first. And now it becomes its
own thing. And then you go into edit
mode and so on and so forth. Just like
that. Uh, I should mention if you want
to get quickly get rid of a loop cut
that doesn't change your geometry, you
can do Ctrl X to quickly dissolve that.
If it does change something like this
and you do Ctrl X, it might completely
mess up your geometry. So, just be
careful of that. And sometimes it won't
actually remove the loop cut if it's a
major part of your geometry. So, just be
careful about that. And then, of course,
you can do that duplicate by selection
thing. So, what you can do is uh shift
the duplicate, right click, cancel, p
separate by selection. Um, you don't
have to use a mirror modifier, but if
you want to, you totally can. Go into
edit mode, select these, e, extrude it
down or something, you know. I don't
know. It's it's really up to you. You
know, add loop cuts and kind of just
play around with it. So, maybe you want
this one to go down this way, and then
this one you kind of want it to go a
little bit like this. Uh, like down
here, you know? So maybe you don't want
a mirror modifier, but you totally
could. So you kind of have that swag.
Uh, and then maybe some uh, you know,
like a mohawk or something. So you can
inset over here, extrude out like that.
And then we got a got some swag
hairstyle like this. So what I'm going
to do for my hair is kind of just like
get an arbitrary shape. So I'm going to
go to side view here. And what I'm going
to do is select this and select any the
side of the head. Shift Duplicate, right
click, cancel P, separate by selection.
And I'll just call this hair. And then
let's also set its origin point because
right now it's sharing the parent
object's origin point. So right click
set origin origin into geometry. And
let's go back and let's just scale it
down to I don't know like some sort of
shape that I want. And all I'm doing
right now is kind of just like making it
uh the kind of the shape of the hair
that I want. So maybe you want it to
come over a little bit. So you can
totally do that. And what I'm going to
do is go and then I'm going to add like
a loop cut here. And then uh I don't
know, maybe like a loop cut over here
because I kind of want to bring it down
a little bit. So I'm going to select
these two and kind of bring it down a
little bit here. And then maybe I kind
of Whoops. Maybe I kind of want another
loop cut uh I don't know, maybe around
here. I can hold Alt to select this
loop. Obviously, there's no loop because
it's a plane, but it'll do the same
thing. And then I can move this a little
bit because maybe I don't want this to
be uh then I'll just select these and
extrude over down here a little bit. Uh,
and then I can expand over here. Kind of
want to some Whoops. Gy. Let's move it
in the back a little bit. Just like
this. Um, and then maybe extrude this
down a little bit. Just like so. So, you
can see we kind of have our hair there.
And I'm just going to position it a
little bit better there. Okay. Now, what
we can do is add a mirror modifier like
so. Let's just go in here and do this.
And then what we can do is go into edit
mode. And if you want to quickly select
this whole thing, you can do alt, but
you can also do hold down control and
that'll pick the shortest path between
your two selections. And then you can
just do E and then lock it on. For me,
it's on the X-axis. Oh, make sure you
turn on clipping. GX so it smashes
together. Same thing for this side. So,
uh, what we want to do here is hold
control and select this and then do E
and then lock it on the X-axis and snap
it here like so. Now, because we
extruded the top here as well as the
back here, what we have is two vertices
here. So, this is what you can see that
they're overlapping and we don't want
this. So, what we can do is hit A and
merge and by distance. And if you adjust
this, you can see removed one vertex
here. Or you can change it up a little
bit. But again, we only had one
overlapping vertex, which is this one
right here. So, it kind of just merged
it. Now you can see when I move the
verticy it's not overlapping or
anything. So instead of doing alt
extrude along normals and hitting s to
scale evenly which we totally could do
that is a destructive procedure which
means later when we want to change this
with alt s which is scaling along the
normals it's going to be really really
kind of messy. So instead of extruding
it what we can do is actually add a
modifier called a solidify modifier. And
now you can see when I increase its
thickness, it might be going the other
way, but you can change that just by
dragging this other way or changing the
offset. And then clicking even
thickness, right? We want even
thickness. And then you can do that a
little bit. Wait, let me sorry, let me
just zoom in so you can see what I'm
doing here. Uh, and now we just play
around with this. And until we apply
this modifier, we can just keep on
adjusting it until we get something that
we like. And that way you don't have to
keep selecting everything every time and
adjusting it. Now, because it's a
modifier, you don't actually get to edit
the stuff that you're seeing because it
hasn't been applied yet. So, you only
see this. And if you adjust this, it's
going to adjust the solidify modifier.
Now, in edit mode, if you want to hide
it, you can click this. And then, when
you go into edit mode, you don't see it
anymore. You can do the same thing for
object mode and hide it like that. And
as you can tell, by using solidify
instead of extrude, we kind of have a
more procedural workflow here. And then
of course, you know, we can still edit
it. We can still go in wireframe. Bring
this down a little bit. It's kind of
clipping inside, which is okay. Um,
yeah. And, uh, it doesn't really matter
that it was clipping for us, but like
I'll just keep it outside. Yeah. So, we
kind of have all our parts to the
character. Uh, just play around with it,
you know, edit it how you want it. Um,
you know, there's really no right or
wrong answer here. uh kind of just have
fun and uh create your character. All
right, now we can start being a little
bit more organized because we have so
many objects. So, what we can do is just
box select everything or you can just
come to the outliner and kind of select
uh what you want. So, like so. So, if
you want to skip one in between, what
you can do is hold click the first one,
hold shift, and it'll select everything
between then hold control instead and
that'll add to the selection. And then
you can hold control shift and it'll
select everything between this and this
one. That way you can avoid this because
if you just hold down control, it's just
going to select two of them. But if you
do shift, it's going to select the one
in the center. Or you can hit control
and click it on it twice to deselect it.
Either way, lots of ways to do that in
the outliner. Then hit M, new
collection, like a new folder on your
computer or something. And you can just
call this character or whatever you
want. And then for the tree, you can
show the tree again. You can see now the
tree is a little too small. or maybe our
character is just too big. It doesn't
really matter.
Either way, one of them has to change.
So, I just moved my tree up a little
bit. New collection and we call this
trees and then create that. And then by
putting in a collection, you can quickly
hide everything. So, you can see if I
minimize these, I can disable both of
them or reenable them just like this.
Super super cool. And of course, you
know, if you want to give some clothing,
maybe like a dress, maybe you can delete
this uh and just bring this up here. So,
we have snapping GZ. Just snap it here.
I don't know, maybe add a loop cut here
or something. Uh, hold alt to select
everything. Alt, maybe just separate by
selection so it becomes its own thing so
it's technically a belt. Then hit alt E
along the normals. S to scale evenly.
Um, and then maybe you kind of have like
a dress here or something. Uh, maybe
something like so.
Uh, and then you could select the inner
loop. Holding Alt, you can select the
inner loop here. Uh, S, and then do Alt
S to scale along the normals a little
bit. Scale evenly with S. Um, maybe
something like this. And then you can
insert this a little bit. Uh, like so,
and kind of extrude up here.
Uh, like so. And then you can go into
edit mode, wireframe, select this side.
Let's actually let's select the back as
well. Let's go into solid view GX and
just smash those together. Uh, so we
kind of have a dress there. Um, and then
maybe scale it up a little bit. So yeah,
now we kind of have a dress. Same thing
with the footwear. I don't know, maybe
you want some boots here. So you can
like select this, alt E, select this
loop, shift, select these as well. Uh, P
separate by selection. So they're kind
of their own boots. Now maybe a loop cut
here. Alt alt E along normal. So we can
have some boots here. Um
yeah, I don't know. Yeah. So then we
have boots. Uh we can hit F2 boots. This
we can call it dress. Um
uh and then it looks like we have
something extra here. So we can go into
edit mode, wireframe, delete this face
here. Go back. Uh uh and then if you
don't want it completely like uh like a
stick figure, you can add like a loop
cut here and then like extrude this face
out here so it kind of looks like they
have hands. Yeah. So a lot that you can
do with what we're doing here. Yeah. So
I mean honestly just like play around
with your model. Do kind of whatever you
want. I'm going to deselect these.
Maybe scale this down a little bit.
Like so. Let's see.
you know, really, really up to you what
you kind of want to do with your model.
I mean, you have so many opportunities.
Uh, and then maybe I want heels. So,
I'll give it like two loop cuts here or
something. And then I'll delete these
like so.
And then now I kind of have these gaps
here. So, what I can do is actually
select these edges and hit F to fill
them. So, like here, can select these
two edges, hit F to fill. And I can
select this loop here with alt and hit F
to fill like that. And then here I can
have some heels. And then it looks a
little bit too big. So I can go into
edit mode, wireframe. Probably select
these. Whoops. Let's go to edge select
and just select these. Gy. Move it up a
little bit here.
Kind of like so. And then maybe scale
this down a little bit. SC a little bit
up like so.
Uh maybe bring maybe bring these down a
little bit.
Um
uh and maybe the head is a little bit
too big. But now we have an issue here
because it's going to take the average
of the origin points to scale. And you
can see when I scale this is going to
happen. So what you could do is apply
your modifiers. And now when you scale
it and then reset objects at origin
origin to geometry and then it'll work.
Okay. But we don't want to get rid of
our procedurally modulating yet. So what
I'm going to do is select this object.
Do shift S and do cursor to selected.
And if you come up here, you can see by
by default it's on median point. It
might be bounding box center for you if
you're on Blender default, but you can
change the transformation pivot point to
3D cursor. So now when I select both of
these, you can see it's going to scale
around the 3D cursor rather than the
average of these origin points. So if
you want, you can make your head a
little bit smaller. Bring it down a
little bit like so. Make sure when you
are changing your other things like you
do bounding box center, right? Cuz if
you select all these, you can see it's
going to start scaling around the origin
point. And maybe you're okay with that.
Uh, you know, if you if you want that
behavior or if you just want bounding
box center, which is I assume is usually
the default. For us, median points and
bounding box center doesn't have a
difference for us. Uh, then you can also
see things like individual origins. So
you can see each of these are getting
scaled along their individual origins
rather than the average of them like so.
Uh I guess we could have also done
active element. You can see active
element. So because this orange one is
active element, it's going to scale
along the origin point of this object
here. And you can see it's the same
thing as moving our 3D cursor there. Uh
but yeah, I'm going to leave it on
bounding box center.
And then maybe you want some shoulder
straps. So this is kind of being
covered. So, what we can do is go into
wireframe, select this GZ, just snap it
over here so it's not overlapping or
being hidden. Go into edit mode. Two
loop cuts. Maybe SX like so. Whoa.
SX like so. And then GX just to move it
somewhere. Three. Face select. Hold Alt
to select the whole loop. Alt T. Extrude
along normals. S to scale evenly. Maybe
a little bit along the Y a little bit
more. Like so. And then we kind of have
some shoulder straps here.
Now, if you don't like how everything is
blocky, I intended to keep everything
blocky just for simplicity purposes, but
you can totally do a little bit more
advanced things, right? You can hold alt
to select this loop and scale it up a
little bit. And you can see it's no
longer blocky. It kind of gives a more
outward vibe. You can also just select
both of these if you want this a little
bit wider than the sides, like so. Um,
yeah. And then obviously there's a lot
of other things that I'm not covering in
this tutorial. For example, if you want
to like bevel, you can do like Ctrl +B
and use your mouse wheel to adjust the
number of cuts and things like that. And
you can see it just makes it a little
bit more curved. And then you have a lot
of other options here. Um, so obviously
there's a lot more than you can do than
what I'm showing in this video, but I'm
trying to just keep it really simple.
But yeah, I definitely want to show you
all this cool stuff because I'm really I
really really like Blender and it's
really cool. And uh after this video, I
definitely encourage you to start
exploring other creators and their
tutorials and and creating your own
things. Uh of course, don't forget to
save your file. Okay, so I have my
updated character here and make sure you
have your updated character as well. And
your character, like mine, if you come
to that outliner, you should see all
these wrenches, which means you have a
bunch of modifiers on them. Once your
character is done, don't apply your
modifiers yet. What we want to do is in
our character collection, right click
and duplicate the collection. This will
duplicate everything inside of there.
Then let's name this character
and then with modifiers with modifiers.
Or alternatively, you can right click
click create a new collection like so.
And just call this modifiers.
And then drag this collection into that
collection. So, if we ever need to
change something, we can quickly come
back here to the ones with modifiers to
change that one instead. But now, for
now, let's just hide that so we don't
see it. And now for our character, we
can come over here and hit apply for
each of our objects. Now, that would be
really tedious, right? We can do control
A or command A if you're on Mac for
every single one, but that's really
tedious to apply for so many. So,
there's actually a really, really easy
shortcut. If you just select everything,
I'm holding shift. Select everything. If
you hit F3 on your keyboard, there's
this thing called convert. And you type
convert to mesh. And this will apply all
your modifiers for you. And now you can
see all those wrenches are gone. That's
a very nice little hack that is good to
know. We can start joining things that
make sense together. So let's select for
example here. Ctrl J. And this will be
our arms. So F2 arms.
Maybe something like this. This is the
neck. That's okay. Um, I can join the
dress together. So, I'm going to select
those. Ctrl + J and call this dress.
Um, this is still legs. I guess I can
just see the ones that are not. Okay.
So, this is hair. So, we can join all
the hair together. So, Ctrl J, F2, and
just call that hair. Okay. So, we have
arms. And you can use your arrow key
just to your up and down arrow keys just
to look at what you have.
All right. So, let's start adding some
materials. So, you can select any object
you want and coming down to the material
tab. If you can't find it, it's right
here. It kind of looks like a ball. And
then you can hit new and it'll add a
material to that thing. And you can see
it has a lot of things that kind of
describes how it will interact with
light and how it kind of look. So,
right, you can like change the color,
you can like play around with these and
so on so forth. But notice how we're not
seeing anything update on our object.
And that's because we're still in solid
mode. So now what we can do is go into
material preview mode. And now you can
see when I change the color, we can see
the color is also being changed. I can
also do things like change the roughness
and change and then change how metallic
I want it. So if it's really metallic,
I'll turn it to one and so on so forth.
Now, it doesn't look like anything like
we expect it to look, not in 3GS and not
even in Blender.
And that's because we're in this mode
called material preview mode. If we want
to be a little bit closer to what it'll
look like in 3GS, we would go into
rendered view. Now, I don't want to do
it in here. So, I'm going to go back to
solid. And Blender actually has a
dedicated tab for us, all set up for us
already to start adding materials and
lighting to our scene. And that's what
they call shading tab. So, if you click
on the shading tab over here, you can
see that our object that we selected, it
has a material. It has this thing called
a principled BSDF node on it. So these
are things what we call nodes. And if
you adjust it here, you can see it also
updates in the material panel over here.
The reason we use this nodebased system
is because it's a lot more visual and a
lot more easier to craft custom
materials when you need to. Now, we
don't have to worry about that because
we're just going to be using this
default material, but in the later you
can see all these nodes and you can
create like functions to create custom
materials and so on so forth. Anyway, by
default, in the shading tab, you can see
we're already in material preview. But
we want to go to rendered view. And this
way, we can actually see lighting on our
scene that kind of looks a little bit
more like 3GS. So, if I go to rendered
view, you can see that we still can't
see anything. And the reason for that is
because we don't have any lighting in
our scene. Now, I disabled the
collection with my point light in it,
but you let's say I turn it on. You can
see my point light is there, and you can
see it's starting to cast some light
there. So, if I turn up the power, you
can see, okay, now it's affecting the
mesh. And if I bring it closer, you can
see, oh, it's starting to light up our
object. And now I can also like shift A,
add a different other kind of light,
maybe like a sunlight. And you can see
the shadows are adjusting to the sun.
And now you can see when I play with
something like the color, like so, and
the roughness. Let me get a little bit
closer here.
You can see there's going to be a little
bit more reflection like so. Now, if for
some reason you don't see nodes, make
sure you check mark use nodes over here.
So, you can see it. And if you select an
object with no material, you're not
going to be seeing any notes here. Now,
the reason it won't look exactly the
same way in 3GS is because 3GS exists in
a browser and it does its own
mathematical calculations, whereas
Blender, you know, it's its own software
and it does its own mathematical
calculations for the lighting and things
like that. And the other reason is
because there's different kinds of
materials. So if I go into 3GS, you can
see there's this thing called mesh basic
material. And if you scroll through the
properties that it has, very few of
those properties also appear on our
principled BSDF, right? Like metallic is
missing, roughness is missing. But this
is the best performing material, which
is why it exists. And sometimes this is
all you need. Now if I search for mesh
standard material mesh standard material
like so you can see that if you if you
want to read it you totally can but you
can see here that now we also have the
roughness and the metalness factor which
is exactly what we have in Blender. I'll
talk about that a little bit later but I
just wanted to draw that parallel right
now. So when we use this material and we
export it to 3GS, it's going to
automatically convert it into a mesh
standard material, which again is more
performance inensive than a basic
material. But for us, we need a standard
material. So we're going to be using a
standard material. So if you want to
know how it looks, you can just play
around with the sliders on the docks.
Whereas in Blender, you're going to have
a very different result. So now you
might be a little bit confused. you're
like, ""Okay, I've seen all those cool
things on Blender. Like, why why does
ours not look that cool at all? It kind
of looks a little bit lame."" The answer
is in our render engine, if you come
over here, we have two render engines.
What we're on by default is called EV,
and this is the real time rendering
engine. So, it's going to be less
realistic than than cycles, which is a
ray tracing engine. So, there's a lot of
options in Eevee that are optional
depending on what you need that you can
activate and it'll get fairly close to
cycles if not indistinguishable at
certain, you know, depending on the job
that you do. But before I talk about
that, let me just quickly talk about
roughness because this is kind of the
one that we're going to be playing for a
little bit. So, if I just take a
screenshot. So, roughness basically just
says how rough is a surface or how rough
is the material. So, let's say your
surface is like this.
And you can imagine like it's a knife or
something or like a sword, right? And
like a metal sword or something. When
it's really smooth, what happens is the
light just bounces right off of it,
right? So imagine these are light rays.
It's just bouncing straight off from it.
So that's what gives it that shiny
appearance. Because the surface is so
smooth, it's reflecting all this light.
It becomes shiny. So if you increase the
roughness to one which means super
rough. You can think of something like
dirt. So you can imagine this is dirt
with all the crumbs and everything. What
happens to light is it pretty much like
scatters over here. So the opposite of
shiny I think like matte or dull they
call it. That's what this will look
like. Whereas if you turn the roughness
to zero it'll look really shiny. So if I
So if I go back here you can see when I
turn the roughness down it kind of
starts looking like plastic. And if I
turn it up, you can see it's very matte
and dull. And if I turn this up and turn
up the metalness, you can see it's
starting to look like aluminum or like a
knife or something like that. So if it's
shiny, then we should expect to see some
sort of reflection, right? So if I turn
this roughness down, how come we don't
see anything? We're in this real-time
engine and it's kind of saving on
performance by not doing all those
calculations. So you can tell it to turn
it on by clicking ray tracing. And now
you can see that we can start moving
this around and seeing those reflections
on our semi shiny surface here. And now
again you can just watch here. But when
I switch to cycles, it's even more
realistic. So I can hit control spacebar
just to expand this window temporarily
and control spacebar to go back. But you
can see that it's a lot more realistic
in cycles compared to when I go into
Eevee. Right? So look at Eevee. Look at
cycles. cycles is a lot more realistic
for us. We're not going to be dealing
with the render engines too much at the
moment. It's just good to know for the
future. Uh if you want to know how your
material might look, I suggest coming to
the docs and just putting it in here to
see what you like. So, let's start
adding materials to our object. So, what
I'm going to do is just expand this a
little bit. And if you want to close a
panel, you can come over to the left and
join the areas by clicking and dragging
when you get this cross area. or you can
right click and do join left and it'll
it'll close that for you. So, I'm going
to stay in material preview. Uh I don't
really care about render too much. And
what I'm going to do is just go for a
very sort of semi- shiny roughness.
Maybe like 0.4 or something like this.
And then for the color, I kind of want
to go for like a skin color. So maybe
something like that. And it'll be for
the arms as well as the neck. So I'm
just going to hold shift and select
these. And then with this as the active
object instead of giving instead of
trying to replicate the material I can
just do ctr L and do link materials. And
now these will have the same material as
this one. So now when I click on here
and go to material you can see it's
sharing the same material. And then I
can rename this skin for example and you
can see it's called skin down here and
it shows you this number three here
which means three objects are using this
material and you can see that indeed
they are. Same thing for the legs. For
example, instead of creating a new one,
I can come here and select skin or I can
do it in the shader editor and select
skin as well. So, I'm going to do the
same thing for hair this time, but this
time I will add a new material. I want
the similar roughness to the skin. So,
0.4555.
So, I'm just going to copy that. Go back
to the hair and copy that in there. Now,
if you don't want to do that, what you
can do instead, let me get rid of this
material by hitting this minus sign
here. What you can do instead is come
over here, select your skin material,
and then hit this duplicate icon here.
And what this will do, it will make a
copy of that material. So, it'll save
that roughness data. And then what you
can do is just adjust the material
appropriately.
So, you can see I'm kind of bringing
down a little bit here, just like so.
And now instead of naming it skin, I can
name it hair. Like so. Okay. But now
what about this dress? What if we want
to give different colors to different
areas of this dress? Well, we can do
that by hitting the plus. This time
it'll say, okay, this object has two
materials to it. Now, right now it's
empty, but we have two material slots.
So, what we can do is again select our
hair material or skin, duplicate it, and
this one we can call this dress, and you
can call it red. And then for this one,
we can do the same thing. So this one,
we can also do dress red. Duplicate it.
And then here we can call it dress
white. And then for dress white, we can
come over here and just, I don't know,
maybe change it to like white or
something.
And then what you can do is go into edit
mode and select the faces that you want
your specific materials on. So So let's
say maybe at the bottom here I want
white. So I can hit assign. So now this
has all the white. Now this has the
white material and this one has the the
well this is brown. So let's maybe make
it a little bit more red, right? So
maybe something like this. Like so. So
that's how we have it. And if you want
to, you can add another loop cut and a
loop cut like here. So maybe you want a
stripe here of white and hit assign like
so. So now you have like a stripe there.
Super awesome. So again, you can do the
same thing for the boots as well. You
can select one, dress white, maybe
duplicate it. Uh, colored boots.
Um, and then I don't know what color
this should be. Maybe like orange or
something.
Uh,
yeah. And I don't know what color this
should be. Maybe like brown or
something. I don't know. So, for our
eyes, what we can do is actually add
another mesh. So, I'm going to shift
right click to put the 3D cursor
somewhere arbitrarily on here and add a
plane like so. And then I'll do RX90
like so. scale it down a little bit and
then SC like so. Now, I don't want it
overlapping. So, what I'm going to do is
go into edit mode and just hit E and
extrude it just so slightly.
And then I go into local view, go back
here and delete this back face because
we'll never need it. And then come back
out a little. Now, it's still clipping
inside because the rotation of the head
probably does not match the rotation of
this. So, what I can do is come over
here and look at the rotation on the Z.
And you can see it's 180.69. So what I
can do is come over here, hit N, and
then do 69 here. And now you can see our
eye is
now you can see our eye is all good.
And then uh let's just scale it down a
little bit. Uh SC looks kind of creepy
right now. Then again, let's do a mirror
modifier here. Mirror modifier. Select
our object right here, which is our
head. And then we can give it an eye
material. So we can do new. We can call
this eye. Oops. I could have duplicated
it, but honestly, it doesn't really
matter. No one's going to be paying
attention. And then we can change it to
something like uh very dark there. So,
if I go back, you can see, okay, there
we have our character. And again, if you
want to, you can go into rendered view
and kind of take a look in in Eevee. And
if you want, you can try in cycles and
and so on so forth. Uh yeah. So, yeah.
So, my character is done. Just make sure
the eyes you rename those eyes and make
sure they're in your collection over
here. I accidentally left them outside.
That's also make sure to have a copy for
the one with modifiers. So, shift
duplicate, right click, cancel, and then
just hit M and then go into modifiers,
character with modifiers, and move eyes
0001 into there. It's automatically
hidden, so you can't see it, but you can
see it is indeed here for us. Super
super cool. So, now we can apply this
eye mirror modifier. All right. So,
let's just go to solid view, uh, hide
our character, and go back into layout.
Uh, yeah. So, honestly, I don't really
know what's next. Um, I do recommend you
just try and make variations for these.
So, like for the tree, for example,
maybe let me just do shift s cursor to
world origin. Shift a add like a plane
or something. Just move it over here.
Scale it down. And then, I don't know,
go out, edit, extrude. Um, add some loop
cuts over here. Uh make a tree branch
like here and then add another loop cut.
Extrude like here. Select this. Alt E
extrude along normals kind of thing,
right? Uh so then you can make different
tree variations. So maybe another loop
cut here. E extrude over here like so.
I'm just doing it quickly. I'm not even
thinking about it. Um alt E along
normals. So on so forth like totally
okay, you know. And then you you you can
just keep making variations to your
trees however you want to. Um, you know,
you know, it's it's really kind of up to
you. Uh, so yeah, just play around. I'm
not even thinking about it. I'm just
having fun making my trees. Um, and and
so on so forth. Yeah, make variations.
And then if you want to do like grass,
for example, like uh I'll call this like
grass for example, go into edit mode, e
extrude. You know, it doesn't have to be
anything complicated. You can just make
some grass strands just like this. Uh
like so. And this would be considered
grass.
You can make flowers. So let me just
make like a flower or something. Uh
again, it doesn't have to be
complicated. E alt e extrude along
normals. So on so forth. E extrude along
here. Uh maybe E extrude along one more
time. And then maybe E independently
this time so we don't uh have them
joined. So then we kind of have like
flower petals, right? So this kind of
looks like a flower. I bite a very low
poly flower and then you can like move
these up a little bit. So GZ and then
you kind of have like a square flower if
you materialize that. Of course you can
make this a little bit thinner. So S and
probably scale that down a little bit.
Uh so you have a flower, you have some
grass, you have some tree variations,
and then you can make some rocks. So
let's add a plane again. And then you
have something like I don't know gx uh
sy
uh e extrude um maybe inset here like so
gsh shift z move it somewhere over here
extrude a little bit here and then maybe
shift right click somewhere shift a add
a plane go into edit mode E and extrude
out and then make some smaller rocks
over here randomly something like so GZ
um and then maybe something on the
bottom down here so maybe some more
crumbs over here. Now, now there is a
lot of overlapping geometry. So,
ideally, you don't want that, right? So,
so you'd select it GY and snap it to the
face, right? You don't want it
overlapping. But again, you know, it
doesn't really matter for us that much.
So, if you want to just leave it
overlapping and not put in the work,
that's totally fine as well. So, then we
can all join these together. And then
this would be like one rock variation.
You've got a rock, you got a flower, you
got some grass. Of course, you can make
grass variations. You can make as many
tree variations as you want and uh so on
so forth. And of course you want to give
the materials. So this rock here we can
call create a new one called rock um and
just make it like gray or something. Uh
flower it can have several. So again add
multiple material slots. One for the
center which will probably be like white
or something. So I'll just call this So
I just call it flower center. And uh
since it's at the top the whole thing
will be white. Um, but I can just do
control I to inverse.
And I'll call this petal. And I'll make
this like a rosy red or something. And
just hit assign. And then let me just
select these faces down here. And I'll
call this stem.
And uh I'll just make it green or
something. Call it stem. And hit assign.
So let me go back into merch preview. So
there we have our flower. Then we can
create grass. And then here we can add
some design to our trees. So add like a
loop cut and then maybe something like
so. Uh I guess I also want a loop cut
down here. And then we can add like
three materials. So one we can call
trunk like so. We can make this a little
bit brownish. Um so that looks okay. And
then what we can do is select this whole
thing. So let's go into over here just
like so. Hold control to deselect that.
Uh and then I also want to select this
top. So, I'm going to hold down shift
and select the top. And then, whoops, I
have to deselect this again. Cool. Just
like that.
Uh, let's go back to material preview.
Uh, let's create a new material and call
this tree leaves. Like so. And then hit
assign. And it can be like green or
something. And then these bottom faces
here can be a little bit more uh darker
green for example.
Um, so I can do new and I'll call this
tree leaves dark. Uh, assign it here.
And then maybe make it a little bit
darker in the green area. Um, and this I
don't like this green at all. So I'm
just going to darken that. Uh, and yeah,
I mean, honestly, I don't really know.
There's just so much you can do with
like uh planes and and cubes and cubic
worlds, right? Like if even if you want
a fence, you can extrude a little bit
and then SX make it a little bit
thinner. Whoops. Sorry. We probably
should have added a loop cut first, but
that's okay. We can add it after. Um,
let's go into wireframe. Just bring this
up a little bit and then scale it down.
Uh, go into edit mode. SY. And there we
kind of have like a like a fence for our
places. And I don't know, maybe you want
like a car or something. So maybe create
a car shape. Let's XX a little bit. S Y,
I don't know, something like this. E to
extrude it up. Two loop cuts like so.
SX. Scale it up a little bit. Maybe move
this back a little bit. And then extrude
this up like so. And then um yeah, just
hit A to select everything. Kind of make
it a little bit bigger. Shift right
click somewhere. Shift A. Add a plane.
RX90.
Go into edit mode. Hit A to select
everything. E to extrude out. Um and
then maybe just move it a little bit
like so. S make it like a little bit
bigger. And then um and then give this a
mirror modifier like so. And then select
our car object. Uh and then we also want
to do it on the Y-axis. So our single
mirror modifier is now making a car.
Uh and then we have a car here. So
totally like that. And then we can maybe
add some like loop cuts here. S Y and
kind of extrude the center here. So we
can have something like so. Uh so I
don't know maybe a few more tricks that
I like to talk about. So if you have a
numpad you can do Ctrl+ to increase your
se selection. Also come up here select
more or less and select more. And you
can see that it's doing the same exact
thing. And if you want to repeat the
last process you can do you can do shift
R and it'll just repeat that last
process that we did which was more. Then
if you want to select all the linked
objects you can do ctr L. Since
everything here is connected to each
other through extrudes and insetss and
things like that, it'll select
everything. But let's say this rock here
for example, which were all separate
objects, right? If I go into wireframe,
you can see none of them are joined. If
you just select anything, even like a
single verticy and do ctr L, it'll
select the entire linked object thing if
it's connected. So you can do like shift
or something like on three different
things. do Ctrl L and then it'll select
those three different objects. Um, so
really really fast tip there. A few more
tips and tricks there if you're curious.
Uh, yeah. So just make some stuff and
give him some materials. Don't forget.
And I'll see you on the other side. So
what we want to do now is add our
ground. So we can do shift S and let's
just do cursor toward origin and shift A
and add a plane. And this will be kind
of our walking area. So, if your plane
starts clipping, as in you can't see it
anymore, what you can do is hit N, come
over here, and go into view and change
your end to something a little bit
larger. I think by default it might be
at 100. Um, but you can change it up to
a,000, like so. That way, you can see
more of your plane. Um, obviously
depends on your computer performance,
but most computers should be able to
hand,00 especially in solid view. uh
particularly in solid view it should be
okay to hold a little bit longer end
here. And of course now your objects
might be a little bit inside. So just
make sure they're up a little bit. And
then for a character uh now we can kind
of join our character all into one
object. If you want again you can
safeguard it and duplicate this uh
duplicate this collection. Uh and just
call this before joining character
before join uh and then hide it if you
want to. Doesn't really matter anyway.
Uh I also notice I have a plane added
into my character here. Uh so make sure
I didn't have I also do have that. So
let me delete that with X. Let's hide
that. And this is actually our ground
plane. So we can move this to a new
collection called ground. Create. So and
then for all these we can just select
all of them. And for us we want the
origin point at the bottom. But none of
the objects have the origin point at the
bottom. So let's just select this one.
Ctrl J. And uh let's go into control
period gz snap it to this vertex and hit
enter. And then just control period to
confirm that. So now we have the origin
point there. And now we can do and then
we can turn on face select uh sorry face
snapping gz and just snap it to the face
there. Gz hold control and just move it
somewhere arbitrarily. Okay. So in
Blender there's a lot of ways to scatter
objects around your scene. Uh, I'm not
going to be covering those because I
don't want to overwhelm you with so many
Blender tools. So, what we're just going
to do is do shift D and shift D and just
kind of move your trees how you want
them. And if you kind of want them in
like a row, there's this really cool
modifier called array. So, you come over
here and do array. So, search for array.
It's also in generate. You can see the
path of it. So, add modifier generate.
Array is also right there. And you can
change where it's being offset. So you
can do like diagonal patterns. You can
increase how much you want. Um, you
know, so on and so forth. And then of
course if you don't want it diagonal,
you can just do this. And then you can
have something like so. And then you can
just repeat that. And then you can
shifty duplicate RZ 90 and so on and so
forth. And yeah, kind of just place
everything everywhere.
Now the whole time we've been doing
shifty. And what that means is I'm
creating a complete separate clone
that's not linked to this object in any
way. You can see when I scale and adjust
this, it's not affecting this one. And
that makes intuitive sense, right? But
there's also this thing called
instancing. So if I do alt D instead of
shift D and just move it somewhere like
let's say here and I edit this, look
what happens. It's still it's editing
the original one as well. And then vice
versa. If I edit, if I edit this one,
you can see it's going to be editing the
instance of it. Now, the reason we have
instancing is because if we have
something that's identical to each
other, we don't want to select all of
them and change it. So, one, it saves on
time. And then second, it also saves on
performance because we're kind of
already telling the 3D software like,
hey, this is identical, so don't waste
your time trying something new for it.
So, if you know you want to adjust
certain objects, you can do alt D
instead of shift D. This way, next time
you deci This way, next time you decide
to change it, you know, you won't have
as many issues because you don't have to
select both of them to change it. The
last thing I want to show you is an
image texture because somehow we need to
display our projects into our 3D world.
So, let's quickly model like a sign.
Honestly, it doesn't have to be that
good. Uh, I'm just going to scale this
up as something like a billboard like
here. And I'm going to hit and I'm going
to hit I to insert in here and then E
extrude inside like here. And this will
be kind of our sign. Obviously, you
could like put a pole there or
something, but yeah, let's just say this
is our sign. Let's go into our shading
tab.
And here, what I'm going to do is give
it a new material. Again, you can also
come here and do it.
And I'm going to add another second
slot. So, one will be for the frame for
the billboard. And one of them will be
an image texture that we can put on
here. So, let's go to material preview.
And for the frame, I'm just going to, I
don't know, make it like brownish or
something like that. It kind of looks
like wood, right? And then for this one,
I'm going to create a new one. Wait, let
me just name this frame. And I'll call
this project one, like so. And this time
in here, what we're going to do is do
shift A and search for an image texture,
like so. And then plug this image
textures color as the base color of the
principal BSDF. Then let's go into edit
mode. Select this face here. Select
project one and hit assign.
So we can't see anything because we have
no image here. So now what you want to
do is find a project image on your
folder. So you can just do open. I'm
just going to select something. Okay.
Just do this. And now you can see my
image is appearing there. But it's kind
of messed up. And the reason it's messed
up is because 3D software is doing
mathematical calculations on a 2D image
trying to project it or calculate the 2D
image position in a simulated 3D space,
right? Cuz technically when we're
looking at a computer screen, we
perceive 3D but in reality it's just 2D,
right? So this point is further away
from me in this 3D simulated world, but
in real life, this point is actually the
same distance from me as this point
because my computer screen is flat. And
basically UV mapping is giving this 3D
software a map on how to project a 2D
image texture into a 3D space. So, if I
come over here and I go into the UV
editor and I select this face, you can
see this is the map that I'm currently
giving it. So, let me expand this a
little bit. So, if I hit A to select
everything, you can see this is the map
that I'm giving it. And as I move it
around, it's I'm basically telling which
2D pixels do I want to show on this 3D
face. So, same with the other
transformations. You can do G to move
it. You can do R to rotate it. And you
can do S to scale it. And then you can
lock it on specific axes like so.
Obviously, this one only is two axis, so
you can only do Y and X locking. And so
on so forth. Since it's rotated 90°, all
I can do is just do R 90. And then since
it's going the wrong way, I can just hit
minus after I typed in 90 and then hit
enter to confirm that. And now I can
just scale it up a little bit uh to get
the thing to kind of get everything I
want. uh like so. And you can see now my
project is fully there. Now it's really
squished. And if you think about why
it's squished, well, look how long my
images and look how long my frame is.
This is clearly a lot more stuff that
I'm trying to fit in something a lot
more small. So, what I can do is I can
simply just scale it up along the
X-axis, just like this. And now you can
see that hey I do indeed have my project
here. And now and now I can just
uniformly scale it just to get something
that I want. So I can uh scale this up a
little bit the outer frames of the edge
just to make it even. And there voila.
So now we have like a small sign with my
project on there. And again uh if you
want you can just edit the center
instead. So you can do alt s and scale
this up syc
uh and so on so forth and then you can
select this and then just you know
increase this and then you can just
actually increase this instead in the y
direction to thin it out a little bit.
Now before we use these images one thing
we should do is compress them because if
we don't compress them they could be
really large and cause a crash on our
browser. So, there's this really popular
thing called Squish made by Google that
is a free online easy to use image
converter and compressor. So, let me
just drop my image in here. And
generally, WEBP format is going to be
the smallest file size for the best
quality. And you can see that on the
right is after compression and on the
left is before. So, you can see we have
a lot of detail here. And then when I
switch it over, we kind of lose a little
bit of detail, right? we lose a bit of
the color as well. So, if I turn down
the quality way down, like I don't know,
maybe 9.8,
you can definitely see, okay, we
definitely lost a lot of detail there.
We got discoloration,
you know, we're losing color there.
However, look at it from far away. Like,
you can tell, but from far away is very,
very difficult to tell. From close, it's
almost extremely obvious, right? But
from far away, it's very, very hard to
tell. We reduced our file size by 96%.
Which means our experience is going to
load significantly faster. And we barely
lost any quality. So again, all about
trade-offs here. If you need more
quality, then you should go for it. But
I don't really need that quality at all.
So I can download it at 42.6. Now, what
I can do and go back in Blender is ren
to the WEBP file and add it instead. And
then I can go back into solid material
preview and then hit alt R just to
refresh the images just to make sure.
And then this doesn't exist anymore,
which is why it's red. You can exit that
out and then do PC background.webp
instead. So it's the same image. It's
just compressed in a smaller format. And
you can see there's virtually no
difference. Obviously, this is a lot
more discolored now, but from far away,
no one's going to be able to tell at
all. And our camera will kind of be far
away in our experience. So again, just
to recap, let me take a screenshot uh of
of this screen,
right? So when we're working with 2D
textures, we only have the U and V
coordinates, right? Or I'll just say X
and Y coordinates. So X and Y
coordinates.
Whereas in the 3D world, we have the Z
coordinate, the X coordinate, and the Y
coordinate. and somehow a point in 2D
space like here let's say so let's say
this is like 37 or something this point
of 37 has to go into some sort of
translation here let's just say I don't
know 5 uh 10 and um 7 like so and that's
exactly what the UV map is doing it's
mapping a 2D coordinate to a place in
the 3D world in a 3D coordinate uh I
guess I also kind of didn't expect why
connecting this color of an image to
this base color for this principal boot
BSDF node makes any sense at all. So how
does this work? Well, by default we have
this base color and what it's telling
what's telling the 3D software is that
take all the pixels that you see on your
screen right now. So imagine your screen
is a bunch of pixels that you can't see.
Wherever this object is on your screen,
it's going to be coloring those pixels
this base color of white, right? This
area of your screen is the pixels on its
screen right now are are white because
we're telling the 3D software to make
the base color white. Now, if I move
this over here, the pixels on your
screen over here are now being painted
white. The pixels from over here didn't
suddenly move over here. The pixels are
still here. They're just changing their
color. So, what an image technically is
is just a bunch of colors, right? It's a
bunch of pixels of colors. So if I
really really zoom in here, you can see
we have these pixels, right? What a base
color is, it's just saying all these
pixels that you see here, this one, this
one, this one, this one, this one, so on
so forth, just make it a solid color.
Whereas for an image, for each pixel of
an image, the color might be different
or it might be the same or something
like that. Now, there's a little more
complexity there, but if you don't think
of it as like quote unquote a color and
an image, rather an image is a
combination of a bunch of random colors,
then it makes sense that instead of
using a full flat color, we can just
simply use an image as our color
instead. Yeah. So, just to really drive
that point home, like imagine you're
looking at your computer screen like out
not not the software, just your computer
screen in general. it's made up with,
you know, millions of tiny and tiny
little pixels, right? And those pixels
aren't like physically changing their
location. They're just recoloring based
on what's happening to the screen. So,
all the pixels on my computer screen
that are showing this,
those are going to be taking those
colors. Now, when I rotate this, this
isn't actually rotating at all. Um,
right? Because we have a 2D screen and
my computer isn't rotating. It looks
like it's rotating, but it's not
actually rotating. Uh, what's happening
is that the, let's say it was over here,
the colors on the pixels on the screen
are just coloring it in a way that it
kind of makes it look 3D. So, typically
the mistake is when people look at this,
they're like, ""Oh, it's a color."" And
then when they look at this, they think
it's an image. But an image is really
just a bunch of colors. Yeah. So, that
was definitely a huge thing for me to
overcome initially when I was first
starting. So, so hopefully that makes
sense. Uh, and if you need a better
explanation, you know, feel free to
reach out.
Uh, yeah. So, as I build my scene, um,
if you want to make like a pathway or
something, you could totally use loop
cuts, right? Uh, like cut over here a
little bit. Um, and then maybe add a cut
over here and, uh, kind of have like a
path. I don't know, maybe something like
here. And then, right, you could give
this like a dirt material if you wanted
to. You could either select these and
like even extrude it downwards. So you
kind of have like a downwards path. Uh
you could also just extrude it upwards
instead and then have like a upward path
instead. Um so honestly just use your
creative freedom. Uh and again if you
want to get rid of the edges that don't
contribute to the geometry you can do
crl x to quickly dissolve those or you
can do x and do dissolve edges just to
make sure it doesn't break anything. Uh
alternatively you could make like uh
pathways themselves. So maybe like a
plane or something. Uh you don't have to
use it from the original ground, right?
You can just make your own. S Y go into
edit mode. E extrude this up a little
bit or something like that. Uh and then
maybe you want like like something on
the side. So maybe let's just delete
this half. Delete these vertices here.
And then add a mirror modifier like so.
Do it on the Y here. Then you can go
into edit mode. Add like a loop cut here
face. extrude upwards a little bit so
you can have like a nice path walk
there. Uh and then you can shift
duplicate this and make a a variation.
So and then you can make like a modular
uh I don't know maybe something that's
can connect. So you can like select
these and you want it to open. So you
can like delete those faces and then
right you can select these and fill them
like so. Right here you can select these
and fill them and then you can select
these two and fill them. Uh so now what
you have is a pathway that's open and
then a pathway that's
closed off and then you can make another
pathway like so. Uh and this one is like
extruded a little bit. What we're
technically doing right now is what we
call modular components. Now there's
more systematic ways to do it to like
make it snap to grid so you don't have
to like manually place them every time
and they will like perfectly line up and
there's all those sorts of things. But I
encourage you just to have fun. uh
rather than think about all the planning
and everything and just experiment, do
something creative. So, sorry I forgot
to talk about the camera because this
plays a big role when we're designing
our level. So, let's talk a little bit
about the camera. And if you don't have
a camera or you accidentally deleted it,
just, you know, shift A and search and
add for a camera and it'll spawn at your
3D at your 3D cursor. Now, if you want
to view your camera, you can hit, if you
have a numpad, you can hit zero on your
numpad and it'll jump to your camera
view. If you don't have a numpad, you
can come up to view and click on active
camera here and it'll also jump to
there. And you can see the hotkey. And
you can see the hotkey for this is also
numpad zero. So, if we look at the
camera, there's a lot of options that we
can play with. So, here we have
different types of cameras. So,
perspective, probably the most kind of
common camera you you see and use every
single day. And then there's
orthographic camera and then paranormic.
Orthographic. I did talk about
orthographic views going in the side,
right? How there's no distance changed
from the camera. And this is the same
thing with orthographic views. So, let
me go back into there and let me change
this to orthographic.
And let me select this and do gy and do
gy. You can see it always looks the same
size no matter how far away it goes from
the camera. You can also look outside
from the camera. You can see it still
looks the same size as if it was here.
If I select my camera again and change
that to perspective. Now, if I change it
now, if I move it back, you can see the
trees definitely look a lot smaller than
when they're up here. Right? This is
like one and a half cursors. And then up
here, it's now the size of two of my
cursors rather than like one and a half.
So, if we take a look at Crossy Road, it
seems more like an orthographic camera.
They actually use something called an
isometric camera, which some arguably
use interchangeable with orthographic
camera. Um, but that's kind of like a
topic for another day and I don't really
want to get into the weeds of that other
than just know just kind of identifying
that Crossy Road does not use a
perspective camera is kind of a good
enough direction. So, let's go back to
our camera view. And if we want if you
want to go for an orthographic one, you
can. Or if you want to go for a
perspective one, you can as well.
So if you want to quickly angle your
camera, what you can do is move your
view somewhere and then do Ctrl Alt0.
And what that'll do is snap your camera
to your view. Now again, if you don't
have a numpad zero, you can just align
to the view that you want. Come up to
view, do align view, and you can see the
hotkey control al numpad zero, align
active to camera view. Other thing you
can do is when you select the camera,
you can just G and move it while you're
in the camera view. And then you can do
GX and you can see it's moving along the
X-axis and GZ and so on so forth. Now,
if you want to move it back and forward,
you can do GZZ and hit the axis twice.
So, this is a new concept. So, GXX and
what that does is it moves it along the
local axis of that object given its
rotation. Right? So, let me show you
this camera here. GX. You can see it's
going directly on the x-axis. Now watch
what happens when I do gxx. You can see
it's now going left and right based on
its rotation because because if I look
at this, the camera's rotated a little
bit left, which means its local x-axis
is a little bit slanted, whereas the
global x-axis never changes, but the
local one can. So again, if I rotate a
little bit like this and do gxx, you can
see it's doing the local x-axis. Another
really cool thing to know there. So
again, you can rotate it. So RZ just to
rotate it and then you can just keep
moving your camera with G, RZ, and so on
so forth. So if you wanted to do it that
way, you could totally do it that way as
well. You kind of usually use a
combination of both. And then there's
another option here. So if you go hit N
and you come down to view and go into
view lock, you can do this camera to
view thing. You can just use your
regular hotkeys, right? Middle mouse
button and shift to pan and just your
camera will follow you as you change
your view. So maybe you get something
like this or you can now try
orthographic. Um and it'll be a little
bit jumpy on orthographic, but that's
totally okay. Uh you can still move
around just to see how it look. uh like
so. And of course, you can play around
with like the orthographic scale and
stuff and just, you know, see how that
looks. Same if you're in perspective. Uh
I'm not going to be covering paranormic.
Um but yeah, you can play around with
this and and so on so forth. So once you
get like a camera angle you like, you
can just make sure that it looks fine.
So when I do RZ90, that looks okay. RZ90
again. RZ90. RZ90. So that's okay. And
then and then you can select your camera
and just move it around your scene and
make sure everything is looking okay. It
doesn't mean you can't change your
camera position later, but I think in
this tutorial, we're just going to keep
a static camera rotation and camera view
the whole time. So, as you traverse your
scene with your camera, just make sure
that everything looks okay and you're
kind of viewing everything. Okay, so I
finished my scene. Uh, h I didn't spend
too much time on it. Um, you could
totally spend more time on your stuff
and put some cooler stuff. Uh, I was
planning to put some more cool stuff,
but I didn't want to spend too much time
on it. So, I kind of just made it into
like a park. Just to recap, these are
going to be our major ones that we need,
which are going to be our project
billboards that we click on and it pops
up a user interface. So, these are going
to be the only ones that we're going to
be interacting with. So, I kind of just
want to make a small recap on it. Right,
I'm in the shading tab up here on
Blender. And if I click on it and go to
the material tab, you can see I called
it project one. And it's just an image
texture attached to the base color here.
And then on the left here, we have again
the UV editor, which is just our map on
putting our 2D image into a 3D space.
And of course, you can adjust it how you
want. And of course, I'm on the wrong
image here. So, let's just find the
image that I want to be. So, it's this
one. And you can see as I adjust this,
we're just mapping this 2D image into
this 3D space here. Same with this one.
If I go into edit mode, you can see I
called it project two. Same thing here.
I also called it project three. So, I
should probably rename this. So, that's
what I'm going to do. Whoops. I'm going
to call project one and I'll call this
one project two. Project two. And this
one will be project three. Like so. And
optional, but if you want to be
organized, new collection, and just call
it projects. So, the collections you
create in Blender aren't going to
translate into 3JS, but for the Blender
file itself, it's good to be organized.
Uh, yeah. So, I'm going to go back into
the layout tab, and I kind of just want
to talk a little bit about my scene.
This is a completely optional section.
You kind of don't have to watch this if
you don't want to. I might cover a
little bit more intermediate things. Um,
but, you know, it's uh you don't really
have to watch this if you don't want to.
So, if you want to know how I created
some of my things, uh, like like this
ground here. Um, if I go into edit mode,
you can see that it's just a bunch of
loop cuts. Wait, let me go into
wireframe. You can see it's a bunch of
horizontal and vertical loop cuts. So,
in Blender, uh, if I add another plane
here, let me just add quickly add a
plane. And I go into edit mode. There's
this thing here called subdivide, which
I'm just right clicking and doing
subdivide. And you can see it slices it
horizontally and vertically. And then
you can increase the number of cuts
here. So you can see I can kind of bring
it up a little bit like so. And 10 seems
to be the max, but you can always just
hit A and subdivide everything again.
And some people just like to right click
and just do subdivide instead of play
with the number of cuts. If I go into
wireframe, and this seems to be about
the same size as this one. So let me
just go into edit mode. And you can see
that down here it's a little bit
extruded downwards rather than extruded
up. Uh, and then what I did was I just
went into top view and I just did a
selection of about three wide. Sorry, I
should be in face select. Uh, let me go
in face select. And I just did a
selection of three wide like so. Just
using box select and holding shift. And
then I kind of just like laid out my
plan like so like that. Uh, sometimes I
use the circle tool which is another way
to select objects, but I'm just going to
show you what I did. So let's say this
is kind of like my path, right? Uh then
all I did was extrude downwards like so.
What I do is I give it another material
and then this material is going to be
for the regular grass itself. Right? So
I'm just going to leave this like yellow
or something. But uh since that will be
by default the yellow color, right? Uh
let's just make this a little bit more
pronounced. Then since I have the ground
selected already, what I can do is come
over here and create another material,
which I'm just going to make something
really noticeable. And then just hit
assign. So then I immediately create my
path. And since I have all of this
selected and we talked about growing I
think in an optional section you can
grow your selection again with just plus
and you can see it will add to this side
and this side as well. Or again it
should be in select and more. And you
can see it's control numpad plus which
is more which is the operation I just
did. Then since we already assigned our
path to the path material we can just
hit deselect. And now we only have the
sides. So now we can just do alt d
extrude face along normals. Hit s to
scale evenly which is a new concept. Uh
if you don't hit s, you can see the look
at the corner when I hit s it scales
evenly. And if I don't hit s it's not
going to scale evenly. Now these are
already edge loops. So alternatively you
can just hit alt and select them right
and you could have extruded that way. So
that's kind of what I did for the top
here. I just hit alt and it selected the
whole loop. Same thing here. Here I'm
going to hit alt shift and click over
here to click onto the side. Make sure
you don't get one of these instead. So
just here like so. And like so. And you
can see now what we can do is do is just
hit E and extrude it upwards a little
bit. So that's how I made my path here.
If you're kind of curious about that.
Alternatively, if you don't like that
method, uh the path could just be a
plane, right? So you have a plane,
right? Uh let me just see. like the
plane is going to be the base color. And
then on top of the plane, let's say I'm
just going to duplicate it like so. Go
into edit mode, E, extrude it upwards.
Um, and wait, that's a little bit too
big. Something like this or something.
And so what you have here is underneath
this green thing, it would actually just
be the brown thing. So the brown plane
right here, and this would be the green
field or something like that. Uh, and
then you could add some loop cuts. Um,
and then you could add some loop cuts if
you wanted to to extend the path. So
something like this, right? Uh, E to X,
something like this, which is what we
have here. So this would be a plane um,
extruded outwards. Uh, and then you
could totally just extrude upwards and
add the edges that way as well.
Additionally, if you wanted to do like
modular components, which I mentioned
earlier, these could be like a series of
objects that you connect to each other
and snap together with vertex selection.
Um so you also have that option as well.
Now are there pros and cons to each
approach? Uh definitely um it depends on
your use case and things like that.
Again for us I don't want to get into
the details primarily because this is a
beginner course. Now you might be
wondering like okay there's so many
vertices here. Is that going to affect
performance? You know why did you use
this method versus like a method like
this or or something modular? It looks
it looks cleaner. Now it is true that if
you have more vertices you have more
data. you have more information to store
and yeah, you might sacrifice a little
bit of performance compared to something
like this, but at the end of the day, uh
speed matters a lot when it comes to
client projects. So, this approach is
very very fast. Uh and if you know
you're never going to change it, then
just doing something one time is is
totally okay. Uh, I like if you were
going to use this similar design system
in multiple projects, I would definitely
invest the time to make a more modular
system with roots and paths that you
could snap in and use later. What we're
doing is kind of just like a one-time,
oh, I'm never going to really change it
later. So, that's kind of why I went
with the subdivide method. It's also
significantly faster. I think making
this path, which I just arbitrarily made
up, took uh like 5 minutes, whereas
making modular components and snapping
them together, probably would have taken
at least a few hours. So, there's always
going to be trade-offs. I don't want to
get into the nitty-gritty details, but I
do just want to highlight that there's
multiple methods to accomplish the same
thing. And I kind of hope that makes
sense. So, you don't have to understand
all of them right now. just like in the
future when you find these methods and
you develop your intuition on what kind
of method to use, uh definitely keep
that in the back of your mind. Uh so for
the rest of my scene, they're fairly
simple. Um right here you can see
they're just a bunch of cubes that I
have together. Uh a lot of them are
overlapping and I said that was bad
because we're wasting information and
and things like that. But again, at the
end of the day, it's about being happy
and being creative. So, you know, we do
have overlapping geometry, but if it's
not taking away from the aesthetic and
it's not going to be affecting
performance, which is something you'll
develop later with your intuition, then
there's then, you know, just have fun,
like you're just starting out, just
focus on having fun and worry about
optimization and all that stuff a little
bit later. Now, if you are focusing on
having fun and realizing that your
scenes are crashing, then maybe that's
the time you can start looking into
optimization and and things like that.
But but yeah, don't put too much
emphasis on it. And uh you know, don't
don't sacrifice your happiness for it.
But yeah, if I just go into wireframe,
you can see all of these are just cubes.
Uh well, they they were planes that I
extruded upwards and I just duplicated
them over and over again. You can see
like so I just did like wait, let me
deselect this. Yeah, I just did like
shift D and then just moved them around,
you know, whatever. Uh like so. Um, here
you can just see a bunch of loop cut
just extruded cubes and and so on so
forth. So, nothing nothing really that
special here. Uh, for the fences, you
can see I have an array modifier like
so. So, I didn't have to duplicate those
over and over again. And a really neat
trick to flip something if you want to
like put it the way that I do is just
scale it in the opposite direction. So,
I'm going top here, shift D. Oops, I
accidentally selected this. Let me
deselect this. You can see I do shift D.
And then I do s y minus one. And you can
see it's going to flip it that way. It's
the same as if you did s y and try and
flip it this way. So just s y - one. And
then same thing for this side. If you
want to flip it that way, it's just xx -
one. And you can see it flips it that
way. And then s y - one again. So you
get this corner. And so on so forth. sx
- one. And then you get this corner. So
super cool there. So, the last thing
before we export this for 3GS is I want
to add some text. It's actually really
simple. If you shift rightclick to set
your spawn point or your 3D cursor, you
can just do shift a search and type
text. And you can see that we have text
right here. And then if you go into edit
mode, you can actually just start typing
just like a regular keyboard. And if you
want a new line, you can just hit enter.
And you can see that I have a new line.
So, it's kind of a lot like the other
text softwares that use like PowerPoint
and and Word and things like that. So,
what we're going to do is let's do RX 90
and then I'll do RZ90 because I want
them to be able to see here. And again,
remember you can select your camera,
come up to view, cameras, active camera
or numpad zero just to hop into camera
view real quick. Come into your camera,
select it, use G uh to move around, grab
it and move it around just to make sure
everything looks nice. I added some
elements outside of the screen because
if the user is standing here, I don't
want them to see an empty outside. It's
kind of like, oh, there's life out here.
Uh, even if they can't actually ever go
there. Um, so you can see as I cross the
edge here, I still have some stuff in
the distance. So, it kind of makes it
feel a little bit more alive. Anyway,
everything seems to be looking okay, but
we want to focus on our text here. If
you want to, you can optionally come
over here and create a new viewport. And
you can select 3D viewport which will be
by default because we split from a
viewport and leave this one in camera
view. Whereas over here you can play
around with this. And if you want to
quickly maximize stuff you can do
control spacebar and it'll maximize this
view or hover over this one and control
spacebar and it'll quickly maximize this
one. You can do the same thing for this
or the outliner and so on so forth.
Alternatively, if you don't like the
split thing here, you can just right
click over here once you get the two
crosshair things, and you can just do
vertical or horizontal split. I'll do
vertical in this case, and it'll do the
same thing. Alternatively, you can go
into F3, the global menu, and do split.
Look for split area, and you can just do
vertical split, and you can see we get
the same exact line. So, you have three
options there to get another view if you
wanted to. Anyway, let me just do that
again. Uh, sorry. And enter camera mode
here. Okay. So, on the side here, we're
going to have our text. So, let's just
make sure we can see it. And let's make
sure it's readable when we walk by it.
So, it seems to be okay here, which is
great. So, I kind of want it to point to
the projects. So, I'm just going to call
it projects. And it looks like I
oriented it the wrong way, which is
totally okay. RZ 180. Just flip it like
that.
Um, and then, and then, of course, we
can just add a sign. So, I'm actually
just going to shift Duplicate this. Uh,
and then move it somewhere over here.
Uh, I'm going to get rid of the modifier
and I'm just going to probably delete
the top, I guess. And just fill this in
with F. GZ. Move it up. Um, like so,
probably. And then here, I think I'm
just going to extrude it. You could add
another mesh if you wanted to, but I'm
just going to extrude it. And I want it
big enough so the user can read it. Uh,
so I'm going to go into wireframe and
probably just I don't want it to go
upwards, but maybe I'll just go a little
bit more downwards instead. But again,
do it for your scene and how you want to
do it. And then here I'm going to turn
on face snapping. And I'm just going to
do G, hold down control to toggle it,
and just move it across my face.
Something like this. Um, again, we want
it to be readable. So maybe select both
of these and increase this. And then
increase this a little bit. And then
make this a little bit smaller. gy.
Cool. And since this is a text object,
we can't just extrude it, right? We
can't use the same hotkeys. There's no
face select or anything like that. So,
what we can do is you can see we have
this object data properties tab down
here. And you can see in the object data
properties, there's this thing called
geometry. And if you do extrude, you can
see it's going to add some depth to your
text. And you can see just 0.2, we have
some depth there. Cool. Okay. Now, what
what I want to do is change the font.
So, if you close geometry and go to
font, you can see we can change the font
here. Now, I don't have a pixelated
font, but if you do, you can just use
that. I kind of wanted to match the vibe
of the overall scene, right? Cuz we're
kind of going for blocks, so this kind
of looks out of place. So, if you want
to find fonts, you can go to Google
Fonts. Uh there's a lot of free
resources, too, but I just like to use
Google Fonts because they have a free
public license, I think, um which means
you can use it in commercial projects.
So, it's kind of just like a default
safety thing. And I just typed in pixel
here just to see some pixelated fonts.
Um, I feel like this will match. Not
exactly, but you know, close enough. Um,
so I'm just going to do get font here.
And then I'll just do download all. Then
just make sure to extract it. And you
don't have to install it. You don't have
to install it. You can just navigate it
to in in Blender. So come over here, go
to regular, and just navigate to where
you saved it. I saved it in my project
folder. And you can see it's right
there. So I can just double click there
and there we have our font. So now we
can just scale it down. And maybe you
want it in all caps actually. So maybe
we can do projects projects. Um
I don't know. Yeah. I mean it doesn't
match exactly but you know it's it's
it's close enough. Whatever. Uh and I
kind of want it to point a little bit.
So here I might um I might do something.
Well let's extrude it first. Gy and then
SZ. and just move it down like a point
like so. I don't want it to be
completely merged together, so that'll
be okay. And then let's just give this a
material right now. And I'll just call
this text. Honestly, not a big deal. And
just make it like black or something.
Um, yeah, gy. Just move it across here a
little bit more. Um, I just want to make
sure it's readable, so I'm going to
maximize this. It's kind of readable.
Uh, I guess it could be better. Um,
maybe we can make it like a brownish
instead, like a like a light brown, and
that would kind of like stand out. Um,
but also match like the woody kind of
vibe. Let's go into edit mode and maybe
let's go to solid here. Let's select
these and hit I to insert them a little
bit. Uh, and then what we can do here is
assign a new material to it. Uh, so I
can So I duplicated from this and I just
used a bench and dark bench material
which I could have named better but uh
anyway I'm just going to I guess
duplicate add another material and I'll
just call this
sign and assign it here. Um, and then
it'll be like a light brown. So
something like here or something. Let's
deselect it. That's a little bit too
orange. What I'm going to do is use this
eyropper tool. Select this and then uh
just raise it up a little bit.
Cool. And then now we can make this text
a little bit darker.
Cool. So now we kind of have a sun like
this, which if I go back, uh it looks a
little bit better. Um I feel like I feel
like the stick is a little bit too small
for the body. So let's go into
wireframe. Just select that a little bit
and do SY.
Uh or we or we can just select this and
do gy and move it this way instead.
Uh let's see. So material preview. Let's
go back. Sorry, I can also be doing it
here. I don't know why I'm just going
back and forth. Uh yeah, so we can read
projects. Cool. And now what we can do
is just shift duplicate this RZ90.
Uh depending which axis you are, it
might go to another one. So like so. And
we want to flip it. So what we're going
to do is s y minus one, right? It's the
same as doing s y and then just trying
to flip it this way, right? So syus one,
it'll just directly flip over it. And
now our text is wrong. So what we can do
is take it rz 180 and just reposition it
gx. And I'll call this, I don't know,
like main park or something. And now
that I'm looking at it from lowercase, I
feel like it looks better lowerase. So,
I'm going to go back to the projects and
just call it projects.
Cool. So, let's maximize this. And yeah,
when we're hopping around, like when our
character is over here, we'll this is
the vision we'll be seeing in 3GS or
whatever you determine it to be, and we
will be able to read projects and main
park perfectly fine. Uh, so now we can
just convert the text to meshes cuz
right now they're just text objects.
Now, when you convert it to a mesh, then
you'll have all the normal things when
you go back into edit mode and you can't
type anymore. So, this is destructive
modeling again because you can't just
come back and change the text later. So,
normally what you would do is make a
duplicate, put in another collection,
and that way when you need to change it,
you can come back or you can just save a
copy of your file if you wanted to. I'm
never going to revisit this, so I'm just
going to convert it now. So, I'll do F3,
convert to mesh. And now you can see
when I go into edit mode, you can see we
have uh our text and we can go into face
select, vertices select, and all that
other stuff. Okay, so let's just join it
to the sign in case we want to move it
later. Uh it'll be easier to adjust that
way. And now we can just, you know, move
it just like this if we want to. So uh
yeah, we can just maybe move it to the
edge, maybe move this grass thing out of
the way. Um I don't know. And of course,
you could have put it on the same sign
rather than have two separate signs. Uh,
really really up to you there. Okay, so
I'm going to close the camera view one.
I don't think we need it. And we can
always bring it back. Whoops,
accidentally just moved it. Uh, join
that. And honestly, and we're not going
to be animating, so we can actually just
get rid of this, too, which we should
have done at the start of the video.
Okay, so now, as you can see, if I
scroll through here, I have a bunch of
wrenches for a lot of things. And yeah,
I didn't rename properly, which is
that's fine. Uh, you know, it's okay.
Um, but anyway, we have a bunch of
modifiers. So, right now, what I want to
do is instead of organizing my file, I'm
just going to file and save incremental.
It's the same thing as saving a copy,
except it'll just automatically just add
a number. You can see I'm on three now
cuz I've done two incremental saves
already off camera. Um, but it'll just
add another file to your folder. Now,
you can do file, save as. Uh, and then
you can do this like before exporting or
or something like that. And this way you
kind of have your state for the changes
and then another one for after. So what
we can do is hit A to select everything
and do F3 and just do convert to mesh.
And again that will apply all our
modifiers for us. So I all of these used
to be array modifiers. Uh they no longer
exist. But let me just undo that. You
can see this was an array modifier.
These were all array modifiers like so.
Um uh yeah let's do it again. A F3
convert to mesh. It's right there. And
just hit enter. And now you can see all
the wrenches are gone. If I go through
my outliner, we did have these that we
would change later uh for organization
purposes, but they're hidden, so it's
all good. All right. So now we want to
be able to click on these objects. So,
if you want them to be able to click on
the object when they're hovering over
here, like in their camera view and it's
over here, and they can click here to
open up the html element, then I
recommend uh joining them as one object
like so. Uh for everything else, I'll
say you can join them together other
than the moving parts. So the character
and all these signs, all of these other
So for all these other objects,
technically on performance, it's
actually better to join all of them,
especially since they're not moving. So
the way to do that is select everything
that are moving. Everything else that's
static, you can do Ctrl I to invert your
selection, means select everything that
you didn't select originally,
and then you can like select the ground
or something and just do Ctrl + J. Cool.
And now you can see that you have all of
this selected here. And we still have
this light here. So we can just delete
that right now. We don't need that
anymore. And the reason we join them
together is because of something called
GPU draw calls. Um nothing nothing you
really have to worry about, but it is an
optimization technique to join things
together as a single object. So if I hit
period on my numpad key, you can see
that ground is kind of all this. And
then we just have our projects and then
uh we have our character here
like so. And then this is named boots,
but I'm going to rename this and call it
character. And the reason name it was
boots is because I joined all these
objects to the boots over there. All
right. So now we can do some
optimization. Um, completely optional.
We're not going to go into advanced
optimization techniques, but you know,
just to save a little bit on memory.
Remember, we said that we don't want to
have these faces that no one will ever
see. So if I go into my camera view, you
can see that we'll never see the under
bottom face of any of these objects
actually. So what we can do is go into
object mode and select this one. We can
also select our projects as well. And if
you select multiple objects and go into
edit mode, both of them will be in edit
mode at the same time. And what we can
do is go into edit mode and we can just
select a bottom face on anything. So it
could be this one or, you know, it could
be on the bottom of this tree. Doesn't
really matter. And instead of having to
select every single bottom face to
delete them, we can just do shiftG and
it'll bring up this select similar and
you can hit normal. And you can see it
will select all the unders sides face.
So let's go into wireframe. And you can
see all the ones with their normals
pointing down will be selected. Now for
some reason if you notice that let's go
back into solid view that your face is
for example selecting upwards like this
for example somehow on one of your
objects. That means your normals are
flipped. And the way to determine which
way your normals are is to come up into
viewport overlays menu and turn on face
orientation. Now, face orientation is
really important because normals kind of
just tell the software which way the
face is pointing and how to do some
mathematical calculations to that face
pretty much, right? And just to
illustrate this, if I add a plane here
and bring it up, you can see that on one
side it's blue and one side it's red. So
its normal is pointing perpendicular
directly up and down. If your camera is
in a view and you see red, that means
it'll be invisible in 3GS. So just make
sure of that. And if you actually want
to see that in Blender, you can actually
come up here, turn on back face culling.
I'm not going to explain that, but just
in case you're curious, that's how you
do it. And now you can see when I go
here, the plane completely disappears on
that side because the 3D software is
normal. It's like, oh, the face should
be calculated on this side, not this
side. And if you want to flip it, you
can go into edit mode, select that face,
hit Alt N, and flip it. And now you can
see it's invisible. Well, I have it
selected, but it's only like so. Uh, you
can also do Alt N. And you can see that
there's other options here like
recalculate outside, recalculate inside.
And sometimes this will work perfectly
fine. So you don't have to flip. Uh, so
if for example I select, let let me just
make something like all. So let me turn
off back face culling and let's just do
alt n and flip. You can see all these
are red. Now if I hit a and alt n
recalculate outside it's going to fix
that automatically for us. Now blender
won't always do a good job. Uh so if I
zoom in on the text here you can
actually see that this inner here is
needs to be flipped. So we can do that
really quickly. Alt and flip.
Uh same with here. Alt and flip. And if
it looks fine with back face culling,
then you might actually not even have to
flip it. Uh, same thing here. Normally,
you should flip your normals before
joining your objects. Uh, that way you
can do shift G, select similar, and
against normal. And if this text was by
itself, it wouldn't select everything
else there. But luckily, uh, we don't
have too many normals that are bad here.
So, I'm just going to fix this up real
quick. Uh, I don't think anyone will
ever see that side. So, we could
probably delete that face, but oh well,
it doesn't matter. Um, like so.
And then we have like some small issues
here, but uh, probably not noticeable.
So, again, let's just turn on back face
coloring. We can get rid of the normals
because everything looks blue. So, we
can come over here and turn off face
orientation. Let's just go to material
preview
and let's go into camera view. Select
our camera. G like so.
Yep. Projects looks good. Everything
looks okay. No issue with back face
calling. Cool. So now what we can do is
select our object here. Also select our
projects holding shift. Go into edit
mode and just select a bottom face. Uh
any any bottom face
assuming it's blue by the way. Um so
okay, they're all blue. Great. So, let's
turn that off and shift G and select by
somewhere normal.
And it seems to select everything on the
bottom. Let's just check. Cool. And then
I should just be able to delete these
faces. And if I go back, you can see
that we just deleted a lot of vertices,
but nothing on our scene changed. And if
I come down to the bottom here, you can
see all our bottoms are completely gone
from all our trees and everything.
Super super cool. Just like that. So, we
save out a little bit on our memory.
Okay. Let's delete this extra plane. I
don't know why it's still there, so I
just hit X to delete. Um, and I'm going
to rename ground to level up. Then we
have our project one, project two,
project 3, and level. And then we have
our characters. So, these are going to
be the ones that we're exporting. Okay.
So, what I'm going to do is just
organize this a little bit better. I'm
going to create a new collection. So,
I'm going to create new. And I
accidentally had it in here. Whoops.
That's fine. I'm just going to move it
out. And I'm going to call this for
export.
For export. And I'll just drag these two
in here. And then I'll also drag
character in here. And then everything
else, I'm just going to hit this check
mark so we don't see it. All right. So,
now just move your character uh where
you want it to spawn. So, or your
starting point, not spawn, sorry. Well,
I guess technically also spawn. Um, so
that's where my character will start.
Okay, so now we're ready to export.
Again, go into your camera, select it,
make sure everything looks good. Uh, you
don't it it's all good if you have to
reexport. Um, you know, it's not that
big of a deal. Things will happen.
Anyway, let's come over here and just
click our level. Hold shift and select
the bottom one. This is everything that
we want to export.
And let's do file. Let's come to export.
And we're going to be using this format
right here. There's a lot of other file
formats that you can export your 3D
model as. This is going to be the most
well optimized for the web. Okay. So now
what we want to do is come over here and
click remember export settings. That way
we don't have to do it every single
time. We can come into include and we
only want to do selected objects. That's
why we selected these before. So we only
want to export the selected objects. In
transform you'll see this thing called Y
up. That just means up and down is going
to be the y-axis rather than the z-axis,
which is very standard to the gltf
coordinate system. So in 3GS, up and
down is the y-axis, whereas in Blender,
you can see that up and down is the
Z-axis.
So that's something I'll talk about in a
little bit. Anyway, sorry, let me come
back here to glTF. And you can see uh
and seems like they say they didn't save
that, which is kind of weird. Oh well.
Um, I probably have to export it before
they save my options there. Anyway,
again, selected objects Y up. This is
all good here. Now, we can go into data
and open scene graph. Uh, things we
don't have to worry about here. Mesh,
you can see we have UVs and normals,
which is good. Remember, we use those UV
maps that we did for this thing right
here, uh, our image, our project images.
So, we want to export those. And of
course, we want normals, uh, which is
why we checked them. So, that's why we
did that. Um, for a material, we can
just leave everything default here. It
might take off a little bit of quality
from our images, which might not be a
terrible idea. You can see that Blender
also has the option to create WEBP. We
did that with our conversion software
online, so we don't have to check this.
Uh, if you don't want to sacrifice
quality anymore, maybe just turn it up a
little bit. But you can see export.
We're exporting the material and it's
automatic which means it'll take the
format that we're taking so we don't
actually have to change this. Uh and
then just other things that we don't
have to worry about. Shape keys is a
more advanced concept so we don't need
that. Armature and skinning you know
things we don't have. Uh lighting
standard that's totally okay. And then
we don't have any animation so we can
uncheck this too. Even if you leave
these in, you know, it's not really a
big deal. So but since we don't have any
of those we can just uncheck them. So in
some previous videos I've covered these
in more detail but for us we'll just
include you know our selected objects Y
up which is a standard coordinate system
in a lot of 3D software UV normals and
material just export it like so. Yeah.
So now you just come here and give it
whatever name you want and I'm just
going to call it portfolio and uh just
hit enter and add GB and then you can
just export it. Yeah. Uh I guess I just
want to credit the authors of the images
that I got completely free on Unsplash.
So just there. Yeah. So now if you want
to quickly view your model to make sure
everything is okay, you can come up to
3gs.org/editor
and come to file import and navigate to
your GW file. So this is mine right here
and I can just double click and insert
it. So the controls are similar but a
little bit different. So, zoom in and
out is still middle mouse up and down.
Uh, if you want to pan, you're going to
use right click. Um, and if you want to
rotate, you're just going to use left
click. So, slightly different controls,
but yeah. And here you can see the green
arrow is now up and down, which means
it's the Y-axis. Z is typically blue,
and X is usually red. So, we can't see
anything because we don't have any
lights. So we can come up to add light
and you can see just like in Blender we
had all those different kind of lights
and same thing in 3GS we have all
different kinds of lights. So let's say
I add like a directional light which is
like a sun. Um, and you can see that it
kind of just looks exactly like a sun
right in Blender, right? If I add a sun
in Blender, right? So, you can see that
it has the line to show which way it's
rotating. And so, here you kind of see
that, okay, 3GS and Blender, they kind
of have a lot of similarities. And
again, that's very similar to like a
real photography studio and except
instead of playing with intensity here,
you might have like a small handheld
device that plays with the intensity of
your light. Uh so on so forth. So when
you think 3GS is like Blender is like,
you know, your IRL studio, things kind
of just become more natural to you. If I
write this in code, for example, instead
of tweaking it like this, uh you know,
let me just I don't know where to type
it. Let's just put it here. it'll be
your light that you created and then
intensity
uh or whatever the property name is and
then you just set it. So like five or
something like that, right? I I don't
remember the syntax but that's pretty
much it. So here we would type five
whereas in code we would just like write
five, right? So Blender actually has
this thing called scripting. So if you
do some Python scripts, you can actually
write code in Blender to make it do
things. So, you can actually like target
your sun. Um, I'm not going to write out
the code, but you can target your sun
and then you can target your sun's
property, your sun's property, intensity
property, sorry, intensity property. And
then you can just set it equal to five.
So, here you can see that when we're
using a user interface, we're just using
code that someone else wrote. And here
you kind of draw the parallels between
3JS and Blender. So, I hope that makes
sense and I hope that kind of clarifies
things before we jump into 3JS. Anyway,
uh right now kind of just inspect your
model and make sure nothing is
invisible. And it seems like nothing is
invisible, which is great. So, we'll
revisit this a little bit later, but
let's now move on to learning the basics
of 3JS. So, just create a new folder.
So, I'm just going to create a new
folder, and you can name it whatever you
want. I'll just call it
Voxil. Voxil portfolio.
Super super cool. And I'm going to be
using VS Code as my code editor. So you
can download it free for Windows or Mac,
but you can use whatever you can use
whatever IDE or code editor that you
want. It's not going to be that big of a
deal for this. Okay. So now we just
navigate to our folder. So now we just
navigate to the folder that we created
like so. And just select that folder. So
let's come here and create our
index.html file, uh, our main.js file,
and our style.css CSS file. Cool. And
then in index.html, we can use this emit
abbreviation. Just exclamation mark. Hit
enter and it'll fill out the default
necessary stuff. If you're not familiar
with EMTT, I'll be using it a lot. Um,
but you can read up a little bit on EMTT
here and then more on the EMTT website a
lot. It's it's just a faster way to
write code. Uh, if you don't want to use
it, that's totally okay, but I'll be
using it throughout. So, we want to link
the JS files and the style.css files.
So, we can do that. Um, I'm going to use
another image script source. You can see
it's already there. I can just hit
enter. And then I just can go into my
/main.js file like so. It's the same
directory. So, I'm just navigating
there. And then we want to link up our
CSS file. So, link CSS, another EMTT
abbreviation as you can see here. Just
go there dot /style.css and you can see
it's right there. So let's just make
sure it's working. Let's go into
main.js. Let's do alert and I'll just do
hello world like so. And then in
style.css
we can do our global selector and do
some resets. So P 0 our emit
abbreviation rather than typing padding
and then all that other stuff. We just
do P 0 M0 and then we want border box
sizing. So, whoops. Box sizing. And then
just hit enter border box. If you're not
familiar with box sizing and why we
choose border box, it just makes
consistency a lot better uh and width
calculations a lot easier. Uh you can
totally read about it if you want to.
But if you're familiar with CSS
frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap, you
know, it's pretty much standard just to
use box size and border box. And if
you've done CSS in the past, it's
probably likely with border box. Okay,
so now we need some way to run this HTML
file so we can actually see what's on
it. So what I'm going to do is go to
this gear down here and click extensions
and then look up live server like so.
And here in this live server, you can
see this top one. I have it installed,
so you'll probably see this. Uh you can
just hit install and then make sure it's
installed and make sure it's enabled. So
you can enable it. And then when you
come back here, you should be able to
right click on your index.html html file
and see there's this thing called open
with live server. So now when we open
it, you can see it's going to navigate
to our index.html file and our alert
that we created does indeed show here.
Cool. So let's just make sure our
style.css is also working. So we can
just do a quick background color aqua
like so. And indeed it is also working
as well. So if we refresh the page,
cool. Everything seems to be working. So
we can get rid of this. I'm doing Ctrl X
to quickly delete a line like so. And
then we can save all our files. Now,
instead of going to each one and hitting
Ctrl S to save them, I have a keyboard
shortcut. If I come over here, go to
keyboard shortcuts
and search for save all like so. Hit
enter. You can see I have control shift
S as save all files. So, if I do this,
control shift S. And you can press enter
just to confirm it, but it's right
there. This will just automatically save
all my files. So if I hit enter enter,
you can see this dot up here says it's
not saved. Control shift S, it'll save
both of them. Just like that. Then we
can use control W to quickly close this
tab. And we can also control W to close
that as well. All right. So now let's
take a look at the 3GS documentation to
get started. So if I come into the
documentation, let's go to installation.
It'll kind of tell you the two ways to
use 3GS. So, one of them is with npm and
a build tool, which is what I always use
now, but we're going to be going for a
more simple approach, which is you
import it from a content delivery
network or a CDN. The reason we're going
for option two here is for simplicity.
And for beginners, using a CDN is
probably more understandable and less
overwhelming. So, at the end of the day,
3GS is open source. It's all their code
is freely available here and if you want
to you can contribute to it. So 3GS at
the end of the day is just code that
someone else wrote that we're going to
be using. You know if you take a look at
some of the stuffs let's take a look at
the camera. You can see like okay here
we have a camera. Um here we have
another camera and it's got some stuff
that we can use. And then obviously
their camera uses other things that
they've written and and so on so forth.
So 3GS, all of this code is just an
easier way to work with WebGL, which is
the web standard for working with 3D
graphics for the web. So in the past,
there was a lot of other methods to work
with 3D on the browser. Uh today, the
modern standard is going to be WebGL.
And it was like this for a really long
time. And you can see if you go to can I
use website and type in WebGL, you'll
see that most sorry, all major modern
browsers natively support WebGL. But now
we're seeing the rise of WebGPU which is
going to be better than WebGL but you
know we're still seeing a lack of
support here. However, 3GS has kind of
started transitioning to WebGPU you know
as it becomes more supported. However,
since WebGPU is not there yet we are
still going to be using WebGL. So WebGL
is based on OpenGLes. So, it has its own
quote unquote shady language called
GLSL. And it's a very low language,
low-level programming language like C
for example. So, if I go in the docs,
you can see, okay, it kind of looks like
a bunch of math math stuff. Um, and you
know, buffers, what what are those, you
know, really really scary stuff? But I
just wanted to point that out like WebGL
GLSL is very very low language which is
why 3JS exists because if I go here and
look up GLSL and I don't know just
select one of these here now it ends
injs because they're using it as J as a
JavaScript thing that they're exporting
right so the file is in JavaScript but
the code in between the back ticks here
is GLSL code so you could have agsl file
if you wanted too. Um, but you can see
here, look at this. Looks extremely
scary. Kind of looks like C code for
example. So, to really drive this point
home, uh, again, 3GS is code that
someone else wrote, but I just want to
kind of give a more metaphorical
explanation to kind of show you how to
think about this. So, let's say you have
a camera, uh, sorry, a computer, and you
have a 3D object that you want to put on
that computer. Well, we know that
computers communicate in zeros and ones
or that's their language. But you know,
humans aren't programming in zeros and
ones, right? Not anymore at least. So,
what we do is we create a programming
language and we call that C. Since this
is pretty close to zeros and ones, well,
that's kind of over exaggeration, but
it's close to computer language, we call
that a low-level programming language.
And then we have highle programming
language like Python. Right? And then
Python is actually written its base
language is on C. You can see here
Python is written in C. So for Python we
call this a highle programming language.
Now typically if the lower the language
the easier it is for the computer to
understand which means less work and
better performance if you code with a
low-level language. However, the lower
you code it, you know, generally the
more harder it is for humans to
understand. So that's why Python for
example is a lot more popular than C
because Python is easier to understand
and it'll save a lot of time. You know
when you work with a highle programming
language you'll save a lot of time and
even though it might cost on performance
compared to C the trade-off is kind of
worth that effort. That does not mean
that Python is easy by any means or
whatever you do with Python. It just
means that there's kind of this
differential here that we distinguish as
developers and and people that work with
technology and things like that. So this
is kind of the same exact thing with
3JS.
So while 3GS is not a programming
language, it is a library that makes our
life easier and it has a bunch of JS
code, JavaScript code and GLSL code that
makes our life a lot easier. So we can
think like gel cell is pretty close to
zero zeros and ones right it's like C
and then we have 3JS which is like a
little bit above that um and it kind of
just makes things a little bit easier.
So just an analogy to real life. If we
have a camera for example, a real life
camera, a real life camera is a bunch of
math and engineering feet, right? That's
what a camera is. To a photographer, it
might just be a camera with a bunch of
functionality like shutter speed,
aperture, all that kind of stuff that
they can tweak. Whereas to an engineer,
they would look at it and think about
the math behind it and things like that.
So when we create cameras, simulated
cameras in simulated 3D environments,
well that's a bunch of math, right?
GLSL, a bunch of math, which is
ultimately again computer language, a
bunch of zeros and ones. So what 3GS
does is they took the time to write all
those math for us. So we can just use a
camera rather than having to code the
math to simulate a camera. So So if you
need more customization, you would go
very lowle language and code your own
camera. However, 3JS cameras are usually
more than enough perfectly fine. And
then you can have something that's even
more high level than these coding
languages, right? And that's exactly
what we just used, which is Blender.
So again, that does not mean Blender is
easy to understand by any means. It just
means here at Blender, we're primarily
working with user interface, right? You
can write Python scripts and all that
kind of stuff, but you're primarily
working with a user interface which is
based on code that someone else wrote.
However, at this level, at this level,
you're working with a lot of code, but
not very much math. I mean, definitely
math, but not as much as a low-level
language. So, over here, you'd be
working with a lot more math and code,
whereas here, it's probably code and a
little bit of math or maybe a lot of
math, but not as much as over here. And
then with Blender, you're also working
with math occasionally, but it's
facilitated with a user interface. So
again, this is not an entirely accurate
metaphorical hierarchy, but hopefully it
kind of shows you that everything is a
little bit connected here and there, if
that makes sense. A lot of times what I
see is when people get into 3GS, they
think it's completely different from
Blender, for example, and it's a
completely scary different thing than
Blender. However, when you see the
connection, it kind of becomes a lot
less daunting to pick up and it makes it
easier to pick up. So, hopefully the
metaphor that I used here kind of helps
you structure your brain when we dive
into 3GS. You know, the worst thing you
can do is think that something is
difficult when you get into it. So, I
kind of want to structure your brain to
think that, okay, 3GS is actually not
that difficult. The big common mistake I
see is that when people go from Blender
to 3JS, they think or vice versa, they
kind of think these are completely two
separate different things. Like, oh, 3GS
is technical, it's coding, it's going to
be much different from Blender, which is
more creative and or testy and and
things like that. And then their brain
kind of gets stuck in this loop like,
okay, these are two separate concepts. I
can't transfer anything over. My goal
with this long explanation is to kind of
create the connections that okay,
Blender and 3GS, yes, they're different.
Yes, they're difficult to understand,
but see the connection between them and
it becomes a lot lot easier for your
brain to understand this when you're
going into it because you have more
confidence and you think, okay, I can do
this. It's not that different. It's not
that hard. By no means is it easy, but
getting your brain into that mindset
will make learning a lot a lot better.
So, hopefully that helps. Uh, again,
it's not entirely accurate, but
hopefully that helps. Yeah. So, let's
just come back to option two, and we
should just be able to good copy and
paste this. They do have a CDN for us.
So, we should be able to just navigate
it, navigate to it to see it. So, we
paste it in here. Replace the version
number. Hopefully, this is going to be
the latest one. So, just replace it
right here. Hit enter. Okay. And indeed,
you can see, look at all this 3GS code.
Um, you know, yeah, it's just code that
someone else wrote and it's really,
really, really long. So, if I search for
thing like camera, you can see we have
cameras, bunch of cameras, gsl,
um, lots of lots of really scary stuff.
Um, yeah. So, uh, yeah. Anyway, we have
it there. So, we're going to go back and
let's just copy this. Go back here. You
can do Ctrl P just to quickly search for
a file. Go to index.html. And we want it
before main.js, which means we can
access it when we come to main.js. So
we'll just paste it right there. And we
want to change the version number. So
I'm going to highlight it. Ctrl + D to
select the next instance of it. And then
just uh Ctrl +V this. So I'm going to
copy this and just Crl + V to replace it
just like this. Uh and you'll also
notice here that they recommend using
Node.js to serve your HTML file. Uh we
might have to do this later. I'm not
exactly sure. I haven't worked with live
server in a really long time, but I
think we should be fine just with open
with live server. All right, so let's go
here and go to creating a scene. Now, I
recommend you read through this before I
go through it, but I'll just kind of
explain it at a really, really high
level cuz it kind of looks extremely
scary, but it's not too bad.
So, the first thing we're doing here is
just some JavaScript syntax. Import
everything as three from three. So
basically if I go back to what we're
importing from the content delivery
network and search for export and go to
the bottom you can see it's exporting
all these sort these things right as an
object. So you can see the the brackets
there. So all this stuff like to buffer
geometry for example you can see that
it's being exported. So what we're doing
here is importing everything as three as
an object from three. So that means when
we do three dot scene for example,
there's likely a scene in here, right?
And you can see indeed there is a scene.
And since it's a JavaScript object,
we're using dot notation to access it.
Right? In this next thing, we're
creating a new camera. Again, if you
want to look it up, you can do
perspective camera. And you can see
indeed it's part of that exported
object. And then we're just setting some
parameters for the camera. Again, here
it's no different than just in Blender.
So if I go into blender shift a add a
camera right and we come over to camera
we have the perspective camera we have
focal length and and things like that
right so you can see they describe it
the first attribute is field of view uh
the second one is aspect ratio and the
next two attributes are near and far so
while they're not exactly one one to
blend you when you play around with them
you kind of have the same exact effect
so um I'm sure you're familiar with
aspect ratios like when you post on
Instagram or when you post on YouTube
1920x 1080 and images and things like
that. So, you're kind of familiar with
this. And if you played games before,
you've probably heard of field of view
and things like that. So, I don't want
to go into the technical explanations of
what these are, but you've seen these
when you played video games or, you
know, worked with things in the past.
And again, we have the near and far
values, which is something that I showed
earlier and also exists in Blender
themselves. So, it looks scary. It looks
like it's code, but it's actually very,
very simple here. And then here, this
looks scary again, but we kind of need
what we call a renderer. I mean, that's
exactly what we have in Blender, right?
We're kind of rendering a scene or a
visual viewport, right? So, that's kind
of all we're doing. And it renders our
all our 3D stuff into a canvas HTML
element. So, if you're not familiar with
the canvas API or the canvas HTML
element, you can take a look at the
docs, but you can read here the WebGLP
API also uses the canvas element here.
Uh, so we're going to be using the
canvas element. And it's really cool
because you can imagine it like a
painters canvas, for example. And all
all our 3D scene lives inside this
canvas. It's just like any other HTML
element that we can style. So, that's
all we're doing here. So, because we
want our renderer or our experience to
take up the full screen, we're going to
be setting it well, they set it to
window.in width and window.in height,
which means our experience will just
take up the entire screen. Sometimes you
might want your canvas to only take half
the screen, for example. So, kind of
really depends, but for us, we're going
to take up the entire screen. Okay, so
now that you understand this, we should
just be able to go and copy and paste
this. So, let's just copy uh and let's
go into main.js and just paste this like
here. And then let's come into here to
make sure that everything's working, but
it's not working because it says cannot
use import outside a module at main.js.
So, what we have to do is go back into
our index and then we have to set a type
here and we'll just set it to module
just like this. And now when I come back
here, uh that error is gone. But we have
another reason we're getting this error
is probably because the path is not
correct. So let's just go back to
installation. Make sure we got a correct
path. So I accidentally replaced the at
cuz I don't see an at here. So what we
can do is come back here and right
before the V, we can hold alt for two
cursors to place a second cursor and
just hit at add an at just like that.
And now you can see our error goes away.
So everything should be working. So I
made a little small split screen here.
Um, I might go back into full screen a
little bit later, but just to make it a
little bit easier. So, what I want to do
now is kind of just look at what this
did inside our DOM elements. So, if I do
control shift I to open developer tools
or rightclick and just hit inspect,
it'll bring up this developer tool panel
here. So, so if you're not familiar with
developer tools, uh, well, it's just a
handy set of tools that a lot of
developers use in in your browser.
There's a lot you can do with browser
developer tools that will speed up your
workflow. But for us, I just want to
inspect all our HTM HTML elements. So
here you can see we have our, you know,
our classic stuff that we see here. Uh
we have our import map. We have our
module things. We have our head, right?
We have our link. You know, everything
that we see here, we're seeing in the
DOM here. Now, one thing interesting
here though is we see this canvas with
the 3JS engine. But we never created a
canvas. So, how is there a canvas on our
page? Well, if we go to main.js, the
we're actually using
document.body.appenchild.
So, if you look up append child into the
mdn docs, um it basically adds a HTML
element to the DOM. So, you can see that
here renderer.dom DOM element. We're
appending this DOM element to the
document body, which is why this canvas
exists here, even though we never typed
it up in here. We're just adding it
through JavaScript instead. Okay. So,
that means renderer has to be an object,
right? So, what we do is just
console.log renderer like so. And if I
go to the console here, you can see
indeed WebGL renderer is indeed a
JavaScript object. And we're targeting
with the dot notation the DOM element.
So if I go to the DOM element, you can
see indeed it is a canvas HTML element,
right? Super super cool. So we're just
accessing this and we're appending it to
the DOM. So that's kind of all we're
doing. And then we can also look for
this thing here called set size. So if
we come down here and you can see that
it's a function with three parameters.
Okay. So that means we're getting a
renderer object from this code using dot
notation, which means we can check this
by looking at the CDN. So if I go back
into the CDN and search for WebGL
renderer, which you can see right here,
we are creating a canvas and if it
doesn't exist and if it's undefined, see
if it already exists or we're going to
create a canvas element. And you can see
create canvas element uses create
element ns which of a canvas. So if I do
create an element ns, you can see that
it will create a DOM element based on
the string that you pass in. So it's
basically creating a canvas and then
setting it to the WebGL render and
setting the WebGL renderers canvas to
there. And then of course it has to be
exported. So if we go all the way back
to probably the 39th one, you can see
indeed it's right here. Uh yeah, so that
kind of hopefully clears up some of
where all this stuff is coming from. You
know, at the end of the day, it's just
code that someone else wrote. So knowing
where that code is and how to access it
really helps. If you want to go deeper,
you can hold control or command and
click on this. And sometimes it will
work to bring you to the code. In this
case, it's just taking us to the type
definitions. Um, it does seem like there
is a link here to the open source code,
which is cool. You could totally check
that out as well. And if you're doing
the other approach without a CDN or node
modules, it'll likely just tell take you
to the code that you downloaded um right
in your node modules folder. If you have
no idea what I'm talking about there,
that's totally okay. But uh yeah, so a
lot of ways to look at the code that
you're actually using rather than just
using it without knowing what's
available. And additionally, you know,
if you check the docs, it might be
there. So if I look up WebGL 3GS docs,
you can see indeed it is in the
documentation.
And so you can see it has the same
parameters that we were looking at when
we're looking at it in the code itself.
Uh now it's just more explained in the
documentation and the things that we can
access. You can see all using dot
notation.
Uh and if I do DOM element, if I search
for DOM element, which is the thing that
we're working with, you can see that to
access it. Yep. DOM dodom element. And
then it's a type of type DOM element. uh
and it specifically tells you that
indeed it is a canvas. So we did all
that discovery and digging deep into the
code to see where it came from and how
it worked. And sometimes you will have
to do that, but for the most part if
you're a beginner, if you are confused
about what you're working with, I highly
recommend taking a look at the
documentation first and kind of just see
what you have available to work with.
It'll be a really long discovery phase
and you'll use methods that probably
aren't optimized. uh because you are not
aware of capabilities within the 3GS,
but that's totally okay because over
time you'll just build that build that
memory and and things like that.
Okay, so let's just go back to creating
a scene and scroll down cuz we already
talked about this stuff. So next we can
take a look at this right here. So let's
just copy and paste this and just place
it somewhere like over here. So here
we're creating a geometry or the shape
of an object aka vertices and points in
a 3D simulated environment. Right? So
here it's like okay we're creating the
the structure and shape of our object
and it's going to be a box geometry and
then we're creating a material as you
know how it looks like. So this is like
the structure and then this is like how
it looks like and then we're combining
both of those into what we call a mesh
and then we're just adding it to the 3GS
scene. So if you can see here we have a
3GS scene which again if you have a
Blender scene you can just like imagine
that the Blender interface itself is
just you can just imagine like if you're
using Blender with the interface it's
like blender. So we're just adding it to
you know our our scene pretty much. Here
we're creating a cube right. So if I
look up box geometry and click here you
can see this is what a box geometry
looks like. And you can see here it has
a width and height and depth of 15. So
it's going to look the same if I set
this all at one. You can see when I make
the width a little bit smaller, it now
looks like not a cube. But if I leave
everything one and one, it's just going
to be a scale down cube there. And then
here we're creating a color material. So
we just called mesh basic material.
Again, if you want to look at it, you
can just paste it in the documentation
and see what you what's available with a
mesh basic material. So you can see here
that we can adjust the color and things
like that. So here what they're using is
the common hexadimal string. So if I go
back into Blender uh shift A and add a
cube. That's pretty much all I'm doing.
So this is my Blender scene and I just
added a mesh. You can see mesh cube. And
that's all we're doing in Blender and
that's all we're doing right here in
3JS. Blender already has a basic
material for us. Even though if we go
into the material preview, you can see
there's no material here. But the fact
that we're even looking at it means it
pretty much has material honestly. Um,
right. So there is some material there.
It just doesn't tell you that. Um, so in
3GS we're just like explicitly stating
it. Otherwise you can't see it if
there's no material attached to it. I
hope that makes sense. And then here it
says camera.position.z.
So all that's doing is say our camera.
We add a camera here. Sorry, let me
delete these. So we have a camera. So,
by default in 3GS, the camera will just
start at 00 0. So, all it's doing is
it's going along the Z-axis, which is
going to be toward your screen and
outward your screen. So, if you can
imagine that right now in Blender, it's
the Y-axis, but this would be like the
Z-axis. So, we're setting it equal to
five. So, I should technically be this
way. All we're doing is doing GY like
this and about like five units uh this
way. Sorry, GZ in 3GS, but Gy in
Blender. And the camera is not going to
start like this. It's going to start
something like this. Whoops. Minus. Just
like this. So, we created we created
camera up here with those parameters,
which by default starts at the origin.
And now we're just setting its position
Z 5 units towards our screen or towards
us. That way, when we add anything over
here, right, if I go into camera view
and like add a cube, we can see that
cube, right? So that's kind of what
we're doing right now in 3JS. All right.
So let's come back and move on. You can
also again read the read this
documentation and you can see that it
will be added to 0000. Same with the
camera as well. And that's why it says
this would cause both the camera and the
cube to be inside each other. To avoid
this, we simply move the camera out a
little bit, which is exactly what we're
doing right here. Super super cool. So
docs are really good. Definitely check
those out. Now, the next thing we need
to do because we still don't see
anything is we actually need to render
out our scene. So, I'm actually going to
get rid of this and go back here. And
again, you can read this here. So, let's
come here and copy and paste this and
take a look at what we're actually doing
here. So, you can see that, you know,
why don't we just use like a set
interval, you know, to render a scene.
Well, it says here that they're actually
using request animation frame
internally, which means in the code
itself. So now what is request animation
frame? Well, if you look it up, it's
actually a very very common way to
animate things and it's used internally
by a lot of animation libraries and
things like that. So the way I like to
see request animation frame is kind of
like movie strips, right? You play them
over and over again like every every
single frame, right? And this same with
movies. You have frames per second,
things like that, right? So this is kind
of how I see request animation frame.
You know, this is one frame. it caused
itself again. It calls itself again. So
on so forth and you know things between
these frames are going to be changing.
So that's kind of all this kind of says.
There's some more technical issues that
you have to stay consistent with
sometimes, but not really a big deal for
us. So uh don't worry about it at the
moment. So now if I go back here, you
can see oh my gosh, we actually see a
cube. That is so absolutely incredible.
And now you can see the canvas is not
responsive which we'll fix a little bit
later but that's totally okay. And you
can see control shift I go to elements.
Indeed the canvas is still there.
Everything is okay. And we see a cube
because we're finally rendering our
scene. So indeed what we're doing right
now is playing a frame every single
frame but every single frame looks
exactly the same. So what 3GS is telling
us to do is add some animation to it. So
all we have to do is add cube.rotation.x
X cube.rotationy
and add some sort of value to it. Like
so. And now if I go back here, you can
see, oh my gosh, we have a spinning
cube. That's so so cool. Again, if you
don't know where this stuff is, you're
like, how do you know about that? You
know, you know, where do they just come
up with this stuff? You can take a look
at the documentation. So, so we did call
it cube, but we could have equally
called it something else. We just called
it a cube because it looks like a cube,
right? Because we set the width, length,
and height all to 111. If we change
this, you know, it's no longer a cube.
So, we could change the name, right? But
what we're actually using is a 3 mesh
again, which is code someone else wrote.
So, let's take a look at the
documentation here. So, let's come over
to the docs. Let's look up for mesh. And
you can see that indeed it is an object
right here. And we can click on that.
And then we can search for rotation,
right? But we don't see anything. And
you can see why because it's actually a
child of a parent class. So you can see
that indeed it says here see the base
object 3D class for common properties.
So if I come here and click the object
3D and then I search for rotation.
Whoops. Seems like there's a lot. You
can see here that indeed we have a
rotation property which is what we're
accessing right here. And you can see
that it's the object's local rotation in
radians. So if you click on uler angles,
you'll kind of see that. Oh, it kind of
seems similar to Blender. It's a very
very common way of orienting things. So
again, if I go into Blender and come
over here, you can see by default it's
on XYZ uler. You have other methods of
determining how you want to rotate your
objects. Um, these are more advanced
concepts, but you can see by default
it's on XYZ Uler. So, just like in
Blender, we have RX, we have R Y, we
have RZ, so on so forth. So, that's what
we're doing here. We're just targeting
the X, the Y, and we're adding 01 value
to it on every single frame. So, if I do
that in Blender, you can just watch. You
don't have to really do anything here.
Uh, let me just add a timeline. I'll
insert a key frame. So, you can just
watch. If you don't understand what I'm
doing, that's totally okay. I just do R
Y I don't know somewhere over here. Odd
channels. Uh let me go back here and
let's do uh and then let me do RX and
something like over here. And I'm just
going to re insert. And I'm just going
to play here.
And you can see that it's kind of doing
the same exact thing that this is doing
right here. So here you can imagine this
is like a request animation frame uh
timeline in Blender. And if you want
again, you can just actually print out
the cube itself because it's an object.
So console.log, right? And we just want
the cube. Come back to here. Go into
your console.
Here we can see it's a mesh. Here you
can see we have a rotation. And you can
see it has an X and a Y and a Z. Now at
the time that we're logging it, it
already has some really, really large
values. So if you want to see the
rotation on every frame, then you can
also just print that out. So if I get
rid of this with Ctrl X and then paste
it over here and then do dot rotation,
right? You're going to see the rotation
go up by 01 on every frame that it's
called, right? And that's exactly what
you're seeing right here. And then of
course if you want to get rid of one,
you can see, okay, now it's just
rotating along its local x-axis. Super
super cool. So let's just get rid of all
that stuff.
All right. So, before we complete this
scene, how about we take some time to do
a small exercise? How would you make
your camera get further away from the
cube in the Z direction? So, it's still
looking at the cube, but it is getting
slowly further away. If I go into in
Blender, for example, that would be like
this, right? How would we do that in
3GS? In Blender, it's just G and Y,
right? How would we do that in 3GS?
Well, again, we can look up camera. So
we have a perspective camera that we
created up here and it's a it's a child
of the camera. It says see the base
camera for common properties. So let's
take a look at camera and now it says
see the base object 3D for common
properties. So now let's go back to
object 3D and we can take a look at
position
and we can see is a vector 3
representing the object's local
position. Default is 000.
So that means we can use this property
which we are already using but now we
just confirmed it and we can just put it
in here. So camera.position.z
Whoops plus equals and then we can do
something small like 01. And this way we
can actually start from inside the cube
and then go outwards. So now we go back.
You can see we're slowly coming out from
the cube and
Just like that. Super super cool. So, if
you want to make it faster, of course,
you can increase this like so. And you
can see it's really really fast.
Like so. Super super cool. So, let's
just undo that. And
yeah, so let's just get rid of all that
stuff. Yeah. So, that's the result.
Congratulations. Uh, you've completed
your first 3JS application. you know,
it's a very dense thing. So, you know,
you should be proud of yourself if you
got this far. There's a lot to take in.
There's a lot to, you know, find and
know about and things like that. So,
take a break. Um, get some water or
something like that. But hopefully you
realize that, you know, 3GS it's very
difficult. Yes. But, you know, this is
something you can do and it's it's
something that you can learn uh with
time. So, you should be really really
proud of yourself. uh celebrate these
wins and uh yeah, come back to the video
when you're done celebrating.
All right, so let's make a few quality
of life adjustments and fix our
responsive issue thing here. So the
first thing I want to do is kind of just
put the canvas HTML element directly in
my index.html.
Not because that this is wrong. I just
kind of prefer it because it's more
clear that way to me. So what I'm going
to do is come over here and do dot
experience which will automatically
create a div in EMTT with a class name
of experience.
And inside here I'm going to do a canvas
HTML element and give it an ID of
experience-
canvas.
So we have our wrapper with a class of
experience and an ID. You can also make
this an ID as well because we'll only
have one of these. So now you can see we
have a canvas. We have two canvases. one
that we injected with JavaScript and one
that we just created ourselves. Now,
let's go into main.js.
And here, since we're setting everything
up here, we can just set our canvas here
as well. So, con canvas equals document
getelement by ID a very common selector.
And we want to target our experience-
canvas. And we can just directly add the
canvas here. So, canvas and canvas just
like this. And now you can see our
injected 3JS canvas is gone. And our 3JS
canvas is now the canvas that we passed
in ourselves. Super super cool. The next
thing we need to do is keep track of the
sizes. So when we resize, you know, our
canvas and renderer is going to have a
different window inner width and inner
height, right? So we have our camera
listening to window.inwidth, our
renderer as well. So since we're using
this in two different places, we might
as well just use an object and refer to
that object in the event that you know
later down the road we don't want to use
window.in width or window.in height and
rather want to use the canvas itself.
However, for now we will be fine just
using window.inwidth and window.in
height. So again, we can just uh come up
here and I'm just going to come over
here and and create a JavaScript object
called con sizes equals.
And then we're going to have a width
that we're going to refer to, which is
just going to be the window.in width by
default. Whoops, sorry. Inner width. And
then we're going to have a height. And
that's just going to be the window.
Height. You can see right there. And
make sure you spell that correctly. Now
for renderer. size instead of here we
can do width. We can do sizewidth size
width. We're just accessing the width of
the object uh the object property with
dot notation and then this one is just
going to be height just like here.
Similarly for the camera what we can
just do here is do sizes width and then
come over here and sizes do height just
like this. So now we need to listen to
the resize function and update these
accordingly because when the screen size
changes the aspect ratio of the camera
also needs to change as well as the size
of the renderer. So we need to listen to
the resize event on a browser. So you
look at it there's actually a window
resize event listener just like on click
mouse wheel and all those other ones. So
let's create let's come down here and
let's create a function. So let's create
a function handle resize like so on
resize. So, this is the function we're
going to call every time we resize.
Sizes do width equals window.in height,
which we're going to get every time that
we resize. Sorry, I might have said
height there. And then we go down and
then we can just do height. And then we
can uh whoops, get rid of the second
cursor and just do height. And then we
can update the camera aspect ratio,
which is the second parameter here. But
again, we can also just target it. So,
camera.pect aspect equals sizes dowwidth
divide by size.height. Again, if you
don't know where aspect is, it's from
the camera object, which you can print
out to see that. Then we need to call
this thing here called camera.update
projection matrix
and matrix projection. Uh these are
mathematical concepts that people are
using to create this simulated camera.
So that's kind of all they're doing. You
don't have to go into detail here other
than just once you change it, you know,
you kind of have to update the math
behind it. And and it's just telling 3GS
to do that here. And then of course we
need renderer set size. So right here
and then we can add the event listener.
So let's just copy and paste this window
dot oh dot add eventlister resize. And
then we can just p pass in our function
here called handle resize.
So if you want to hear it, if you want
to see it, you can just do console.log
resizing.
And uh let's go into the console. And
now you can see when I resize, it's
resizing. But we have these bars over
here because at the end of the day, it's
still an HTML HTML element. So we want
to style our canvas to also match what
our renderer is doing. So let's come to
style.css. And here we have experience.
So, let's do experience like so. Let's
just do position fixed.
Fixed. Let's do height 100%. Width 100%.
We can do top zero, left zero. And then
we can do our experience. Experience-c
width 100%.
Height 100%.
And then we can just do overflow hidden
over here. This will get rid of our bars
there. So now you can see that when I
resize actually let me get out there so
it's not doing that. You can see that
everything looks all great. Just to go
back if I go back in here and go into
main.js and not call this.
Take a look at what happens.
Right? So we have a little bit of an
issue there. Now there is one property
of the renderer that we also want to
change when we're handling a resize in
the renderer and that's called device
pixel ratio. So it's basically the ratio
you can see here of the actual physical
pixels on your computer screen to the
resolution in CSS pixels. That means if
your computer has a lot of pixels on its
screen, then to represent a certain one
pixel in CSS, it's going to use three
physical
pixels on your screen to represent that
one pixel in CSS.
So, this will be good when you have like
jaggedy edges and things like that
because you have more pixels to display
that sort of thing, right? I mean,
imagine you only had like five pixels.
Imagine your computer screen was like
this and you had to make a curve. Well,
you'd like light up this pixel, light up
this pixel out of this pixel. Your
screen would only have nine pixels to
show this, right? Whereas, you know, if
your screen had a billion, a million, a
jajillion, a zillion pixels, uh you
could easily make a curve and it would
actually look like a curve.
Whereas if you only had nine pixels, you
it would kind of look like a like a like
a arrow rather than a smooth curve. So
what we do is come up here renderer set
pixel ratio like so. And then we use a
math.min function. So it so it's going
to take a bunch of values in here and
choose the lower of the two. So we're
going to get So we're going to get the
device pixel ratio and then we're going
to put two here. The reason we're
choosing two is because that's kind of
widely accepted as, you know, you don't
need anything above two. Otherwise,
it'll make your GPU extremely intensive.
The higher your pixel ratio, the more
difficult your GPU has to work. And it's
kind of just been standardized that two,
anything above two is kind of overkill.
So, unless you're doing experimental
work or something highly realistic with
only specialized devices, you know,
generally two is kind of the the
standard here. And then obviously if
your computer does not handle two like
you know if its ratio is like one or
something then you whoops sorry you're
just going to use your Windows device
pixel ratio rather than rather than two.
But if you have anything above two it's
just going to cap it at two. So it takes
a lower amount of those values. And then
we typically also put this in the resize
function because if you're dragging your
browser window to let's say another
monitor and that monitor has a different
pixel ratio and things like that. Okay,
so the next thing I want to do is add
some controls just like in Blender,
right? It kind of it's kind of lame that
we can't actually move or do anything,
right? So 3GS,
if you look up and look for some
controls, you can see they have a bunch
of controls that, you know, they coded
up and let us use. And one of the most
common ones that you'll see a lot is
orbit controls. And this acts very very
similar to Blender's controls that you
have. And Blender also has other
different kinds of controls, right? They
also have this fly mode. And if you come
here, you can see that okay, 3JS also
has fly controls. And if you want to
look it up, you can do like fly
controls. And then you can click on
example and you can see okay, this is
kind of like the Blender fly controls.
And if you type in orbit controls,
you can give out orbit controls a try.
And you can see, oh, this is kind of
like Blenders, right? And it's also kind
of like their 3GS editor and so on so
forth. So let's add some orbit controls.
So if we go back to the docs and go to
orbit controls, you can see we can just
import orbit controls from here. So
let's go back to VS Code and let's just
import our orbit controls.
So just like this, we need to create a
new controls and we need to set its
camera and the renderer DOM element. So
let's make this a little bit more
organized. Let's put our renderer up
here. And then our camera comes after.
And then we can put our controls after
just like this. And then instead of And
then instead of here, we can just put
our canvas element that we're targeting
up here. Then we need to tell it to
update. So controls.update.
And now you can see we can right click
to pan. We can left click to rotate. And
we can use our middle mouse button to
zoom. Super z super cool. There's a lot
of other things that orbit controls can
do. Uh but we are not going to be using
them, but you know definitely exploit
that if you want to. All right. So now
we're kind of ready to start loading our
model in 3GS. Now if you're a complete
beginner, you probably don't know how to
do this out of the box. So I'm going to
assume you either going to go into the
3JS docs and look at load. And luckily
there is indeed a load 3D models here
and it kind of explains that I'm gonna
assume alternatively you go into Google
and then you type it in there and then
you can see well Google's Gemini is AI
is kind of giving a suggestion here
already. Of course you could use like uh
of course you could use other AI stuff
like chat GBT or cloud or cloud sorry um
and then you can also exploit like 3JS
videos on loading models or maybe
another text resource here and just read
through that. So when you're learning,
you know, this is kind of expected and I
actually encourage you to seek out
multiple resources primarily because one
resource might go down another different
route of explanation
that is in more in-depth and might make
you more interested or intrigued. You
can see here in this resource, it kind
of even talks about the version
differences and why we use GT glTF. You
know, here it also says we use G2LF, but
it's kind of more brief compared to this
3GS resource here. When you're learning,
definitely explore your resources out
there and cross reference them. Make
connections. You know, one explanation
might click better with you than another
one. Okay, so let's just scroll down
here and import our G2 offloader. Same
way we did our orbit controls. We're
just importing it from code that someone
else wrote. Now, let's grab our
portfolio GB that we exported. Let's
just do Ctrl +B to open this bar real
quick. And then just drag our GB file in
there. Then we can close this out. And
uh let's just copy this loader. And
let's hit Ctrl +B to close that. So
let's just copy and paste this. I'm
going to put it um maybe before the
camera. So something like right here,
like so. And then we can update our
path. We're in the root directory and
the same directory. So we can just do
dot slash and then of course change it
to the name. So mine is portfolio.gb.
So we're going to be doing
portfolio.job.
Okay. So let's take a look at what this
actually does. Unfortunately, it doesn't
show in here, but it says see gltf
loader documentation for further
details. So we can take a look at there.
And I don't know, just scroll down until
we find what we're looking for. So here
we have properties and you can see we're
doing loader.load.
So is what we're looking for. And here
we can see the parameters. So the first
thing is a URL, a string containing the
path to that GB file. So this is the
path that we created in the first
parameter. Super super cool.
And then we have this second thing here
which is an onload function. So when the
GB file is done loading, what are we
going to do? So since we have a GLB
file, I'm just going to rename this. Crl
D to select next instance and just name
it GB. But on load, what we're doing is
adding the GB scene to our scene. So
when we exported our scene, you know,
our level and all that kind of stuff, it
also has its own scene and we're just
adding that to our own. So if I do
console.gb
like so. And now if I go back here, you
can see in the console, we indeed do
have an object and it has a scene. Super
super cool. And if we open that scene,
there's eight children in there. If you
look at the eight children's name, you
can see that they're level project_1
project_2 project_3.
These are the exact names that we gave
them in Blender all into this GB file.
So here our GB file is just a JavaScript
object. And since it's a JavaScript
object and its children is an array and
the array is an array of objects, then
we should be able to just target
something. For example, so if I do
console.gl.cene
scene dot children and it's array. So
I'm just going to pick the first one and
we see the name is level. So we can just
do name to access the name of that
object at the children array of zero
which is in the GB scene. So now when I
print you can see okay we get the name
here which is level super super cool.
Now even though our model has loaded
successfully, we can't see it because
what it's doing is using a mesh standard
material and that's needs a lighting
source. The reason we can see this box
without any light is because it's using
a mesh basic material which doesn't
react to light at all. It just colors it
pretty much. So what we can do is go
back to gltf sorry the docs and just
look up a light. So here I'm at lights.
We can go for like an ambient light for
example. So I can just copy and paste
this here and we can just put it you
know right after the model itself just
like this
just like this and you can see that okay
we pick a color and then we have an
optional intensity default is one by
default the intensity is one and if I go
back now you can see oh wow we see our
model so I'm going to rightclick and
just come up here sorry let me close
this and you can see wow we indeed do
start seeing our model and if you want
to update the intensity That is the
second parameter of an ambient light. We
can just update that. So here, let's put
this to like three so we can see it a
little bit better and can see. Wow. Now
we have our scene. Okay. So let's add a
default camera position so we don't
start from the bottom every single time.
So what we can do is go into our anime
function and on each frame what we can
do is console.log log our camera and
position just like this, right? And then
we can get rid of console.log resizing
cuz we no longer need that. And
additionally, we don't need our cube
either. So, we can just get rid of all
this stuff right here. And then we also
have to make sure to get rid of the cube
here as well, cuz we're no longer
targeting. All right, let's go find a
good camera position. Something like I
don't know, really up to you. I'm just
going to start here because that's how
I'm planning to look in a little bit in
the future. Then I'll just do control
shift I. Take a look at what it is. Hold
shift alt down arrow just to copy this.
I'll make this one x and I'll make this
one y. And then here we have about -3.
Here we have 39. And then we about -67
which we're going to be changing later.
So
um yeah. So, uh, for some reason doesn't
seem to be working. Uh, and it's
probably because we're setting the
camera position after we're creating
controls. And the order of operations
here might mess up a little bit. So, if
we just move this up here, for example,
and now we fixed the problem here. So,
you can see every time I refresh the
page, uh, we are now at this vector. So,
yeah, we can comment this out for now
and close this out. All right. So,
there's a few issues that we want to
fix. And if you look at the edges of
these things, you can see they're kind
of jaggedy. So what we can do is turn on
anti-aliasing.
So if you come into the WebGL renderer,
we can just search for it, WebGL
renderer. You can actually come in here
and there's another property here that
is called anti-alias. And you can just
set that equal to true. Now sometimes
you might want to keep it off for better
performance or if a stylistic choice,
but for us, we definitely don't want
those jaggedy edges. So we're going to
leave it on for true. And now you can
see when I go in here, our jaggedy edges
are no longer being shown.
All right. Now, we kind of have a lot of
options that we can do. We could do
controls first. We could fix up the
lighting first, fix our camera first.
Um, you know, there's a lot of avenues
we can take, and there's really no right
or wrong answer for this project,
primarily because all of these are kind
of independent of each other. However,
the first thing that I will be doing is
determining if I want an orthographic or
perspective camera. I kind of already
determined this in Blender. I want to go
for an orthographic camera. But if you
want to go for like a perspective camera
and kind of have it like something like
this, you know, you could totally do
that as well and follow along with the
tutorial if you kind of like this sort
of view rather than an orthographic
view. So, since I want an orthographic
camera, I'm going to search up for an
orthographic camera and kind of just
take a look at what we need. So unlike a
perspective camera, orthographic camera
needs left, right, top, bottom, near,
and far values. Whereas a perspective
camera needs a field of view, which by
the way, you can adjust and have fun
with if you want to. Now, why does
orthographic need all this stuff? Uh,
you can totally get into the math of it
and how the camera works if you want to,
but I won't be doing that. Um, I just
want to talk about how you would use it
if you wanted to. Okay. So, instead of a
perspective camera, we can just use the
orthographic camera. And we can just
copy and paste this right here. Like so.
Save that. At a high very very high
level metaphorical example of the
difference between perspective and
orthographic,
um you can when you have an orthographic
camera, you can imagine that it kind of
looks like this, right? Like this is
your camera. So, you have to set a left,
a right, a top, and a bottom. And it's
kind of just like a layer like Imagine
that if this was from the side of an
orthographic camera, it's just like a
layer like this, which is why everything
kind of looks like the same distance.
So, this is the side view and this would
be like the back view of the
orthographic camera. And then, yeah, if
you wanted a little more side view, you
can see that, you know, it kind of look
like this. So, this is like more of a
diagonal view for now perspective
camera. Let's say we're in the side view
for a perspective camera. You have
something like this.
From the back, this will look the same
pretty much as this. So, I kind of hope
that this one and this one kind of shows
you the two different parameters why
what we have. So, we have a FOV here.
And then here we're setting the top, the
left, the right, the bottom, and so on
so forth. So, we still need the aspect
ratio. So, let's do const and let's just
calculate it right here. And we'll do
sizes width divided by sizes.ight. Sizes
doheight.
So for the left side, we can take the
aspect ratio times 50
and make it minus because we want it to
go on the left side. And then for the
right side, by the way, you can see the
order over here. The right side, we can
just take this except make it positive.
The top and bottom, we can just set it
to 50 and 50 respectively. So bottom is
going to be the last one. So this one
can be 50. And then near and far can
remain the same. Uh we can adjust those
later if necessary. So now if I go back
you can see we have an orthographic
camera. Super super cool. Of course now
we need to adjust this in our handle
resize function. So what we can do is
just do come over here and do con aspect
equals sizewidth divide by size. And
then we can just set the according
properties to these values. So we can
just so what we can do is have four
cursors here and hit Ctrl + C. We don't
have to highlight anything. So, I'm
holding Alt to create more cursors. Ctrl
+ C or Command C if you're on Mac. And
then what I'm going to do is hit enter
four times. And then with holding Alt,
I'm going to paste four cursors here and
do Ctrl +V and it'll paste just like
that. Get rid of the comma. Let's put
our semicolons right now. And then let's
do come over here and put our cursors
again. Holding alt and we can do
camera.ft equals this. And then we can
change this to right. And then we can
change this one to top. And then we can
change this one to bottom. Just like so.
So now when I resize, you can see
everything is still looking all good.
Okay. Let's fix up our lighting. Uh so
right now we just have an ambient light,
which is just a flat lighting. You know,
it's the same lighting no matter where
you are in the scene. So how about we
add like a sunlight, right? So in
Blender that's a sorry, in 3GS that's a
directional light. In Blender, we called
it a sunlight, right? I'm actually going
to go to the directional light helper.
And this way, we can actually see our
directional light. So, let me just copy
and paste this and place it in here. So,
let's just rename this to sun because we
already called the other one light. So,
I just hit hold alt and double clicked
on them. And I'm just going to name it
sun. So, now when I go back, you can
see, okay, now we have a sunlight, but
we don't see any shadows in Blender. As
soon as you add a sun and you go into
rendered view, you already have shadows.
Now, 3GS doesn't work like that because
when you're working in the browser, if
you just automatically add shadows or
automatically add something and
something else is messed up, that could
like completely crash your application
and, you know, just cause nightmares.
So, it's kind of a more of a layered
approach like you add the light, then
you add the shadows, then you might
adjust the materials and things like
that. Whereas in Blender, it's like you
add the sun, you automatically get the
shadows or, you know, and then you just
tweak parameters from there. and a lot
of things are just taken care of for
you. Whereas in 3GS, it's a lot more
layered and you're kind of doing it with
code. So, okay. So, in order to enable
some shadows, we have to set that in the
renderer. So, again, this is all in the
docs. And if you want to, you can also
just console.log the renderer just to
see what is available. But we need to
enable shadow mapping. So, render
shadowmap do enabled. And we're going to
set that to true. Now, we still don't
see shadows because we also have to tell
3GS that our meshes should cast shadows
and receive shadows as well. Again, this
is all about, you know, like a layered
approach. You know, maybe some things in
your scene you don't want to cast
shadows or don't want to receive shadows
and things like that. So, in our GB
here, we can do this thing called
GB.cene.traverse.
And for each child in the scene, we can
do something to it. So if you don't know
what traverse is, that will check all
the descendants or the children pretty
much. So remember when we logged out our
GB file console.log GB like so
um you can see we have this scene and
then we have all these children. So what
this is going to do is for each of those
child it's going to print this out. So
if I do console.log blog child. Here you
can see indeed we get all the children
and all the children of their children
because if I go into scene and go into
these groups, you can see some of these
have their own children. So that's kind
of what we're seeing all here. If you
wanted to, you know, you could do
something like GB.NET
children
and do like for each, right? And then
you'd go through for each of the
children and things like that. But 3GS
provides us by default as part of object
3D this traverse function. So we can
just use that instead. So now for pretty
much all the objects that are being
printed out, you know, all our meshes
that we created in Blender and are now
3GS meshes, we want to tell them to cast
shadows as well as receive shadows. So
first we want to check if it's a mesh
because some of them are groups and
these are not meshes. So let's just
check. So if child is mesh is mesh, we
can just do child.cast shadow cast
shadow equals true. And then we can do
also whoops. We can also do child.rece
receive shadow. Receive receive shadow
equals true as well. So if I go into the
mesh, you can see we have cast shadow
set to true. And we and now we also have
receive shadow set to true, but there's
two of them, which means I misspelled
it. So let me just copy and paste it.
Let make sure I spell this right.
Cool. Now, we still don't see a shadow
because if I look at my directional
light helper, the sun is actually down
here. And what happens is the
directional light actually has a
separate thing called a shadow camera.
And that determines that determines
where the shadows are being calculated.
So, since our directional light is
existing down here, that means our
shadow camera is also existing down
here. and our JB file is nowhere near
inside that directional light. So, it's
still lighting our scene, but our model
is not within that shadow camera. So,
again, why do we have a shadow camera?
Well, again, it's like optimization,
right? So, let's say if your screen is
only here, then maybe you don't want to
cast shadows over here until you get
there, right? So, you'd move your shadow
camera along with your character for
optimization. If you calculate shadows
for everything all at once, every single
time, every single frame, you know that
you might take a performance hit that
way. Whereas, if your shadow camera
remains small, and you only cast shadows
and receive shadows within a specific
domain area, like here, it'll be a lot
more performant, and no one would know
there's no shadows here until you get
there anyway. For us, we're not going to
worry about that primarily because it's
too much effort for a beginner course.
Uh, but that's just why we have a shadow
camera, if that makes sense. So, if I go
back here and look up a camera helper,
so right here, we can actually add this
camera helper to the shadow camera of
our directional light just to see our
shadow camera. So, let's copy and paste
this. And I'm just going to put it um I
guess with my other helper, but this
time I'm going to call it shadow helper.
And instead of put passing in the camera
here, I'm going to put it in our sun.
Shadow camera. So, here we will see our
shadow camera. And now you can see
indeed this is our shadow camera and it
kind of looks like an orthographic
camera would. It kind of looks like a
box. So since our scene is not within
our shadow camera box, there's going to
be no shadows casted. So let me get rid
of this console.log and let's actually
just console in.log console.log our sun
dot shadow just like this just to see
what we have in here. And you can see
indeed the shadow camera is an
orthographic camera and we just learned
about that. So we have to set a left, a
top, a right and so on so forth. Before
we adjust our shadow camera uh frustr
and top values and bottom values, how
about we first actually put our light in
a place that looks good. So what we can
do is target the sun.position
and we can just set its position. So we
can try something like 5050. So 50 in
the x direction should make it left uh
which is the positive x axis and then 50
in the y direction means it should go up
50 units and then we're not changing it
inward and outward on the z-axis.
Everything that's within our shadow
camera is now casting a shadow. Super
super cool. So maybe you like this
angle, maybe you don't. Um but what I
wanted to do is place my light over here
and then just cast some shadows downward
so we can have our shadows everywhere.
Again, that's not the best performance,
but you know, for us, it's going to be
the most simple thing to do. So, I might
bump this up a little bit. Honestly,
really just trial and error at this
point. Um, I think that looks okay. And
now, what we can do is target the shadow
cameras left and right and make it a lot
bigger. So, let's take the sunlight
here. Let's do sun. Shadow dot camera.
And bump it up to like, I don't know,
maybe like -200.
You can see it's now looks like a very
very large left rectangle and we're
getting more shadows there. Uh that
looks like it's overkill. So maybe we
can do 100. And then let's just shift
alt down arrow to copy that line
multiple times. We can do right. Right
will be positive 100. We can do top. We
can do top which can be I don't know. We
can just do at 100. And then we can do
bottom at negative 100. Boom. So now if
I come back here, let me close this real
quick. You can see that almost
everything is in our shadow camera. Now,
if you want to, you could move this
camera over here and then everything
would be in the shadow camera and that
would work perfectly fine. However, the
angle of the directional light and where
it's looking determines the length of
these said shadows. Right? So, if you
wanted longer shadows like what we have
now, you can leave it at the steeper
angle. Now, if I want everything to be
in my shadow camera, there's kind of a
few things I can do. So I can change the
angle or where this directional light is
looking, right? I could make it a little
less steep and draw it like here and
then this would be covered. Or I could
move this up. So if I do like 80,
you can see, okay, our shadows are a
little bit shorter now and everything is
within our shadow camera. But if you
want to adjust where it looks at, I
think right now it's looking at 0000 by
default. You can actually do sun.target
where it's looking at position set. And
then since we're only going in the
positive x-axis detone on the rotation
because it's directly like that, right?
We're not going on the z-axis. That
means we can just adjust this if we want
it to not be as steep at 0 0. We can
just increase the x value. So if I do 20
0 0, just like this. You can see it's a
lot less steep. And then if I crank it
up to 75 75, it should look directly up
and down.
And you can see indeed it looks directly
up and down. And there's very very few
shadows here. Now, there's a lot of
issues here. You can see that we're
getting like these lines, these jaggedy
edges, and all these weird stuff. And
artifacts. Again, this is a math thing
that you don't actually really have to
care about. Um, but it's attributed to
this right here. And what we're seeing,
uh, I called artifacts. I also called
shadow acne and things like that. So, we
kind of just have to set this. I'm not
going to be explaining this in this
video cuz it's kind of a more advanced
concept, but it is something we have to
talk about and set. So, I just wanted to
point that out. So, let's go here and
let's just set it. So, we'll do
sun.shadow
normal bias.
And we're going to set it to 0.1.
Something small like that. And you can
see that fixed all our articles. Uh, and
we don't have those lines and jaggedy
things like anymore. So, if you like the
shadows up and down and not pronounced,
you can do that. Or you can adjust this
accordingly if you want a little more
angled. And then of course you can also
add you know adjust the directional
light as well. And now you can see when
I adjusted the angle you might have to
adjust your normal bias again. So maybe
like 0.2 and you can see okay now the
shadows are a little bit to the right
and our normal bias is uh 0.2 instead of
0.1. So really up to you. Now if you
still zoom in and you look at the
shadows well they're not artifacts
anymore but they look very very
pixelated. And the reason for that is
because of our renderer. Uh we have to
set a property in our renderer to tell,
you know, to use better shadows pretty
much. So if I come over here, uh and you
can see there's different types of
shadow maps. Um and each of these, you
know, they're going to have their
drawbacks and and whatnot. And these are
just things you'll pick up over time. So
if you don't know about it, you know,
you'll probably find it eventually on
like a 3JS Discord forum or or something
like that. So, what we can do is do
shadow map
type. And we can do three. Whoops. We
can just copy and paste this right here.
Just like this. And now when I go back,
you can see that it definitely looks a
lot better. Um, it looks a lot smoother
and so on so forth. Again, we see those
lines there, but that's okay. We can
just adjust our normal bias a little bit
later. But now you can see before. And
if I get rid of this,
uh, sorry, after. That was after. And
now you can see before which is a lot
more pixelated. So again it could be a
completely stylistic choice if you
wanted to as well. Now additionally if
you want your shadows to be even better
you can increase the map size of your
shadow map. So if I go back into the
light shadow docs. So uh all lights that
can cast shadows are a base class for
all the other shadow classes. You can
see right here. Um you can see that we
do indeed have the normal bias here. But
we also have this thing called map size
that you can also increase. So if I come
here um and go into my shadow map here
and do sun dot shadow dom map size do
width and we can set it to like 496.
Shift hold down arrow and do height and
do 40 960. You can see that also reduced
some of our artifacts. And now we have
even higher quality shadows a little
bit. Uh very very high higher resolution
now. All right. Now, it still kind of
looks like the colors are a bit high
contrast compared to the vibe that I'm
going for. Now, if this is the vibe that
you want, then you can totally go for
it. It's kind of giving a high contrast
retro kind of vibe, which is kind of
pretty cool, but this is not the vibe I
kind of want to go for. So, one way to
fix this is by adjusting another
renderer property called tone mapping.
So, if you don't know what tone mapping
is, basically what you do is take a high
dynamic range of values like brightness
values and color values and put it into
a more limited dynamic range. So, why do
we even need tone mapping? Well, again,
there's a lot of reasons for that, but
part of it is also technical
capabilities and limitations. If you're
a human, you kind of see a wide range of
colors. So, we kind of see a vast amount
of colors. Now, this is not true for
computer screens. Computer screens can't
display all the colors that humans can
see. So what they have are color spaces.
So let's say this is these are all the
colors we can see. Computers might be
able to display something like this.
Let's say we have another computer over
here and its color space is something
like here instead of this computer
screen. So this computer screen is over
here. This computer screen is over here.
So tone mapping is exactly what it
sounds like. Just like when we did UV
mapping, we're taking tones like
brightness values and color values and
mapping it within and we're mapping it
to another space that that specific
computer or software can handle. So, not
just between computers, but also between
different 3D softwares. You know,
different 3D softwares operate in
different color spaces. So, if I go back
into Blender here, you can just watch
and I come all the way down to color
management. You can see that we have
different color spaces here. So I can
change it to standard and it'll change.
I can change it to raw and it'll change.
And then I can change it to like filmic
and so on so forth. And that's kind of
the highle idea of why we have so many
different tone mappingss here. And if
you want you can go into the 3JS
examples type tone to look for tone
mapping example. And here you can see
they all have different kinds of types
as well. And you can just switch between
them to see you know the color and the
bright brightness differences and all
that kind of stuff. So, I can just come
here and do like renderer dot tone
mapping and I can set it to like this
one for example. Whoops. Let me just
copy and paste like this one for
example. And if I go back. Okay, so the
colors are not as high contrast and this
is kind of going for the vibe that I'm
going for. However, it definitely looks
a lot more dim. So, what I could do is
come over to my directional light and
increase that. Right. But now it looks
like the colors are completely washed
out. So what we can do instead is adjust
another renderer property called the
tone mapping exposure. So if I do
renderer tone mapping exposure, we can
increase that from one by default to
1.75. And now you can see the colors are
more pronounced, less dim, but it's not
overblown and washed out by increasing
the intensity of the light. So another
thing you can do to adjust the way that
your scene looks is actually adjusting
the material properties that we had.
Right? So, I think I said it earlier,
but the fact that we used um if I go
into Blender here, the fact that we used
a principled BSDF, it's going to by
default use a Blender mesh standard
material. So, if I come over here, you
can see a lot of properties of the mesh
standard material. So, we can view all
of that just by console.logging
our child and material like so. And if I
go back into the console here, you can
see that indeed we can see our material.
Uh this one I just happened to see that
it's frame. So the the material name of
frame which I gave to this back here,
you can see it has a roughness of 0.5.
And if I go back and select frame in my
in Blender, you can see indeed I also
have a roughness of 0.5 here. And then I
have a metalness of zero. And if I go
back in here, you can indeed see that I
had a metalness of zero. So that kind of
translated over into 3GS. However, you
know, if you want to, you can totally
adjust it. So a child material, like
metalness, for example. Metaleness.
Uh let me just make sure I spell this
correct. Um we're we're doing all the
materials right now, but you can set it
to like 0.5 or something. Uh and now you
can see the colors kind of changed a
lot. Uh yeah, so really really up to you
and and whatnot. Yeah. So again, just
like Blender, you know, in Blender, you
have this interface, whereas in 3GS
you're just targeting that object um
property and then setting it equal to
something. So one's with an interface,
another one you're just typing it out.
So a small little optional exercise
before we move on is try and find any
material and change the color of that
material using 3GS. You can always go
back into Blender, change the color
there, reexport the GB file, and replace
it, you know, right here, right? But I
want you to use 3JS to change the color
of a material instead. So when you do
that, you know, come back and uh I'll
show you the solution. So here's the
solution. We already know that as we go
through our child and materials, we see
all the materials that we have here. And
the names that we give the the names
that we gave them in Blender, these
material names are also translated into
3GS. As you can see right here, named
dress pink.
So that means all I can do is just check
for that specific material name. So all
I can do is just do if child do material
name check for equality in a string
equals dress pink. Then we want to do
child domaterial. Whoops. Child
domaterial. And you can see that we want
to change the color. And indeed there's
a color property here. And it's of type
color. You can see here. So dot color.
And I don't know what color is. It looks
like an object and it seems like, you
know, I know what RGB is, right? But
let's say I don't know what color is.
Well, of course, I can always come to
the documentation, search up color, and
take a look at what color is. And you
can see what R stands for, what G stands
for, what B stands for, and so on so
forth. And it also talks about the
different ways that you can set that
color, which is really, really cool.
Spend two.
So, if you want, you can give that a
read. Um, but let's just speed it up and
just say, okay, I'm So, let's just speed
it up and say I'm going to create a new
color and set it like this or something
like that. So, I just do equals like
here. And how about we make our dress
black. So, the way we do that is zero.
So, no reds, no greens, no blues. And
now, when I save it, I go back, you can
see my dress is no longer pink. It's
completely black. Now, you don't
actually have to create a new one. You
can just get rid of this and do set RGB
like so. And you can see it will do the
same exact thing. I just copied it
because it's from the docs. Um, but you
know it's a method of the color, right?
So if I go here and look it up, it is
indeed a function of the color class
that you can just do directly. So you
don't have to set it equal to the new
color. All right. So hopefully that
makes some sense. And I'm just going to
get rid of this. Yeah. So now just take
the time to adjust things in 3GS.
Explore other colors or lights, uh,
other tone mappings and things like
that. You know, maybe you want to use a
hemisphere light. Take a look at some of
these examples. Um, and then you're
like, ""Oh, let me get rid of the
directional light."" Oh, cool. Hemisphere
light kind of has something cool on the
bottom half. It kind of has a different
color than the top half. That's really
cool. And then you can look, oh,
directional light kind of looks like
what we have. So, um, yeah, just explore
around, you know, change the angle of
your lighting, change the angle of your
shadows, find something that you really
like, change your materials in 3JS if
you want, change it in Blender and
reexport if you want, you know, doesn't
really matter. Uh, I also forgot to
mention that, you know, we also have
color spaces that you can set if you
want to, but by default, it's sRGB,
which is good for us, so we don't have
to change that. But, yeah, just have
fun. Uh, find out what works for you and
and so on so forth. So now what I want
to do is be able to click on one of my
objects and pop up you know like an
information panel or something like
that. And the way we're going to do that
is by using a 3GS raycaster.
So you can see that this class is help
to assist with raycasting which they
link if you want to read about what ray
casting is. But basically what a
raycaster is is it creates array. So
maybe you remember from middle school
what a ray is. Basically, it creates a
ray from your camera or wherever you
choose to start and then it kind of goes
towards a value that you update. So,
what does that mean? Well, here you can
see we create a vector 2. So, it means X
and Y coordinates. And then we're
setting the ray caster from the camera
and we're giving it the camera as well
as where our mouse is on the 2D screen
translated into a three vector, too. So,
just to help visualize that, uh, let's
say we have a camera that's right here,
and our cursor is kind of moving around
across our 2D screen, and then
everything else back here is like our
simulated 3D space. Let's say our cursor
is directly over there, and our camera's
just right here, just like this. What
happens is we shoot that ray. If the ray
shoots through an object, we can
actually detect those objects and it can
go through multiple objects just like
that. It won't be technically infinite.
um you can actually set the length of
the array. So if you wanted to um if you
limit the array of the length then it
wouldn't go through this second object
and wouldn't detect that collision. Uh
but for the most part you know it
usually goes really really far and inter
intersects multiple objects if the
objects are close to each other and in
the line of sight. So in order to help
the mathematical calculation what they
do is normalize the device coordinates.
So, you've probably seen it before if
you've done some sort of interaction.
Uh, but basically, you know, in
JavaScript, this starts at 0 0 in the
corner and then this is like, I don't
know, whatever. I'll just say it's 100
by 100. So, when you move your mouse to
the right, your x value is going to 100
and when you move your mouse down,
you're going your y value is going to
100. Now, this is really annoying when
it comes to mathematical calculations.
So, the very common standard thing is to
center take the center of the page and
make that 0 0. And then when you go up
it goes to a value. So in this case it
will be one. And then when you go down
when you move your mouse down your y
will your y value will go to negative 1.
And then when you move your mouse to the
right your x value will go to one. Sorry
let me just uh write this out. And then
when you move your mouse to the left
it'll go 1 and 0. And then down here uh
again this will be 0 and 1. And then
this one would be 0 comma 1 just like
this. And this way it's a lot easier to
do calculations. Same similar idea with
the raycast caster as well. So if you
look at how this calculation actually
works, well event client x is going to
give us a value between 0 and 100 in
this case assuming our screen is 100 by
100. We're dividing by the window.in
width which is 100. Right? So if our if
our mouse is over here which is 50% of
the way we'll have a value of 50, 0. 50
/ 100 is 50%. If we have a 20%, we would
have 20 divided by 100, which is 20%.
This gives us the percentage along of
the way that we're on the screen in the
x as well as the y, which is down here,
right? So, since it's a percentage, that
means we get a value between 0 and 1.
So, we multiply this by two. And we
multiply this by two, which means our
range is now 0 to two. But we don't want
0 to two, right? That means if we go
over here our mouse will our x
coordinate will be zero whereas if we go
over here it will be two. So what we do
is then we take all of that minus one
and then 0 - 1 is going to be ne 1 and 2
- 1 is going to be one. So what we get
is if your mouse is all the way to the
left is negative 1 and if your mouse is
all the way to the right it's going to
be one. And then if you want you can you
can console.log this out and then
console.log this out and then
console.log log this out and it's going
to be the same for the y as well. And
it's just inverted everything because
typically when we work with coordinate
systems, our y starts here at zero, but
for the browser, the y starts zero up
here instead. So everything is just
inverted. That's why we have a minus
here and a plus here instead. So then
we're telling the ray cer what objects
we actually want to intersect. You know,
sometimes you have a bunch of objects,
but you don't always want them to be
intersecting with the ray. So there's no
reason to check for that if you don't.
By default, this is just taking the
entire scenes and all their children in
there and saying, ""Okay, ray caster,
you're going to see if you're
interacting with any of the scenes
children at all."" And intersects will
return an array of objects that the ray
is intersecting with. So, what they do
is they loop through that array that the
ray is inter intersecting with and
setting it to a red color. There's no
greens, there's no blues, but there is
maximum red. So, they're setting it to
red. And they're doing this on every
frame. So the ray caster updates on
every frame. And then here instead of
using the internal one, they actually
used the window request animation frame,
which is actually really common, which
is typically what I do. But for us, I
just used the one in the getting
starting docs just to avoid complexity.
But here you can see that this is
probably more common to use the request
animation frame rather than the inner
one. Not because it's more performant,
just because it kind of looks a little
bit cleaner. Okay, so let's just copy
and paste this stuff into our code. So
let's do here. Let's copy function
onpointer move and let's put it with our
other event listeners. So right here we
have handle resize. We can put our on
pointer move here. Let's get rid of
this. We don't need that anymore. Now
before I add this, I just want to
suggest that generally you kind of have
a consistent naming scheme when you name
your functions. So if you have something
called on pointer move, typically you
always use that naming phrase of like on
resize or on pointer move or on click
and things like that. Whereas, if you
want prefer handle, then you'd typically
do like uh handle click, handle pointer
move, handle resize, things like that.
So, I've used both naming conventions.
Honestly, it doesn't really matter. I'm
just going to use on because 3JS is uh
so I'm just going to highlight this
control D to select the next instance
and just rename this to on resize. And
now we can just copy
window.addeventlister on pointer move
and just place it with our other ads.
And then we can just copy and paste this
into our animate function right here
like so. We don't need this anymore. We
already know what everything does here.
And then, of course, we can't forget to
instantiate this stuff. So, let's copy
this and let's just put it up with our
other instantiated stuff. So, wherever
you wherever that makes the most sense
to you. Now, you can see when I hover
over objects, you're going to see
they're going to start turning red.
Cool. Just like that. That's pretty
cool. So, again, if we reinstantiate
this log here, and you can see that the
ones we're actually going for are
groups. So if I open this group here,
you can see that project 2 is a group.
So we can come over here interactive OB
uh sorry intersect object names. If it
includes the group name, so child, we
called it child in this case, but if it
includes the group name, then we want to
add it to our intersect object. So we
can simply do that just by pushing to
that array. And then we just push that
child there. And then of course now what
we want to do wait we can get rid of
that now is come out down to our
intersect objects instead of using all
scene children right we can just use our
intersect objects array and here what we
can do is console.log log our interex uh
our returned intersect array. Okay, so
now when I ref Okay, so now when I hover
over a mesh, you can see we're getting
some stuff returned, right? And if I
open it, you can see that the ray caster
is suggesting that indeed it hit an
object and it's part of the group cuz
this is what we named it in Blender. Um,
but what we want to look for here is the
object parent, which is the group that
we had. and the name of that and you can
see it indeed it's called project 2. So
what we can do is just select whatever
child is in there. So the first thing
that it's intersecting and then we can
go for the object. So dot object parent
and then the name of the parent. So now
when I hover over Pikachu you can see it
says Pikachu on each frame. This is
project 3. This is project two. This is
project one and so on so forth. So now I
kind of want to give some user feedback
that when we're hovering they can uh
click on it. So what I can do is come
over here and just check. So when I'm
not hovering over thing anything,
there's no intersects, which means this
has a length of nothing. So we can just
simply check if intersect Whoops. If
intersect.length
is greater than zero, that means we're
highlighting something or hovering over
something. Then we can set the
document.body style and the cursor of
that equal to the pointer cursor.
Otherwise, uh we can just leave it at
the default cursor. So, we'll just put
it at the default cursor. And now when I
can hover over Pikachu, you can see it
becomes the pointer mouse. Super super
cool. Okay. Now, what I want to do is be
able to click on this and it trigger an
event. So, instead of console.logging,
what we can do is do like a intersected
object, right? And we can just set it
equal to the
intersects.object.parent.name.
So, we have like an id of sorts. And up
here, we can just create a variable
called let intersect object. And we can
just have that equal an empty string.
And then let's come back to our event
listeners. And then we want a click one.
So we can do click. And then we can call
it on click on click. Then we can add a
function on click like so. Then when we
click, we can just console.log
intersect object.
So, when I'm clicking, it's completely
empty. Now, I'm clicking it's Pikachu
because I'm hovering over it. Now, when
I'm clicking off of it, you can see that
I'm still SL. It's still printing out
Pikachu because we never reset it. So,
what we can do is just come over here
and if intersect length is zero, we can
just reset it. So, intersect object
equals empty. Equals empty.
So, now when I click, you can see empty
string. Click Pikachu. Pikachu click.
It's back to empty string. Here it's
project three. Here it's project two.
Now it's nothing. Now it's project one.
And now it's nothing. And so on so
forth. Yeah. So now we can just go back
to index.html and make a sample modal.
So honestly, you know, make it however
you want. It doesn't really matter. Um
I'll have a modal inner wrapper. And
then in here, I probably have a modal
title. So I'm just going to call that
moto title. Oh, whoops. Actually, let me
put that inside. I have a modal heading.
So modal model header
uh inside will be a modal title and I'll
just multiply by two but actually I want
to change this from modal title to
modalit button.
So I'll call this exit for now. And then
I probably also want a modal content and
then inside here I probably wanted a
modal content wrapper just in case.
So if you look at this HTML structure,
um what I'm envisioning, I guess I
should have done this beforehand, uh was
we have a modal. So let's say we have a
modal. So this is our modal class that
we have wrapping everything. Then we
have a modal wrapper. So it's going to
be inside our so this is the modal
wrapper. And then we have a modal
header. So this will be like our modal
header which has a modal title. So our
modal title can be over here. And then
we have a modal exit button over here
inside the modal header.
And then we have our modal content like
here. And then inside of our modal
content, we have a modal content
wrapper. So this is kind of what I'm
envisioning. And that's kind of the HTML
structure that you see right here. Okay.
So let's just do some uh dummy content
for now. So I'll just call this project
one for the modal content wrapper. Oh, I
guess we also need um I guess a modal
visit project button. So, I'll call it
modal visit button. I don't know. You
can probably name it something better.
Um and then I also want the content
itself. So, modal modal project disal
project description or something. I
don't know, whatever. And actually,
these should be buttons. So, I'm just
going to change these to button. This
one should probably also be a button.
Well, actually, this one's an external
link, so I should change this to an A
tag instead.
And then I'll call C view project or
something. And then for I I guess I
could also keep this project as well.
And then for this, I'm just going to use
Lauram Ipsum. And I'll do four sentences
of Lauram Ipsum. And just save that.
Actually, did that give me four
paragraphs instead of four sentences? I
don't actually remember cuz it's been a
while since I used that. Anyway, doesn't
really matter. So now we have a modal.
So let's go into our here just to see
where it is. So it's over here, but we
can't see it because it's behind our
canvas. So that's totally fine. We can
just come in here and we can just target
our modal and set Z-index to something
like 9999. Doesn't really matter. Then
we can set its position to absolute to
take it out of the flow of the document.
And there you can see indeed we have our
model now. Okay. Now I just want to
center the model. So, I'm going to use
the the typical way of centering it.
Really really common. Uh 50% left 50%.
And then we want to transform it and do
translate 50% and 50%. Like Whoops. Like
so. So, I'm sure you've seen this
before. Um but it's a really common
method to center something. Uh now I'll
set a width for the model. So, I'll set
a width of 100%. so it takes up the full
screen, but I don't want it to always
take up the full screen. So, I just want
to set a max width of maybe like um 700
pixels. So, now let me just go into
responsive mode and turn on responsive.
So, when it's bigger than 700 pixels,
you can see it's not going any bigger,
but when it gets smaller, it it kind of
becomes a little bit more responsive
already. Okay, let's update the font
before we start styling so we kind of
have a better reference. So remember, we
got that from Google fonts called Pixel
Sands. If you want to use a different
font, that's totally okay. I'm just
going to be using this one. Uh it is
kind of hard to read. Uh but you know,
you can always change it later. So I'll
just do get font and I'm going to get
the embed code. And uh yeah, so then I'm
just going to copy this and go into my
index.html. So control P index.html.
Let's close this out. Let's make this a
bit bigger. And let's just post it in
here like so. Let's go back to
style.css.
And uh yeah, we can just set the default
font family in the global selector to
pixel pixel sands. And if that doesn't
have it, we can just set it as a default
sand serif. Okay, there we have.
Honestly, just style your model however
you want. I'm just going to show briefly
what I'm doing. Um, but I might change
it later and you can just take a look in
the code on the CSS changes I make uh
off camera. Um, but I I'll just show
like the general things of what I'm
doing. So maybe like 12 pixels. Um, and
then we can give the model a background
color. So we can give it an arbitrary
background color. So I like a pastely
color. So what I'm going to do is is
find something pastely. Uh, so maybe
something over here.
Um, I don't know, something cute. Uh, I
I want to go for like a cute sort of
vibe. Um, and it can be like a different
color for each project or whatnot. So,
you know, nothing is really set in
stone. So, copy this hashtag hashtag
hashtag hashtag.
Cool. And then we can have a border. And
we'll just set it like 2 pixels solid.
And we can just make it # white. Super
cool. Super simple. Super cool. Um, and
then maybe we can make the color of the
font uh also a hashtag hashtag white.
Um, yeah. And then semantically this uh
should not be a div. This should also be
this should be an h1 or something like
that. Um, so that'll automatically
format for us. Of course, you can always
format that if you want to. And since
our modal header is wrapping our
exit button and title, uh, let's make it
span the whole width. So modal header
header let's just set its width to 100%
of the model wrapper with the padding.
Uh and then we can do display flex flex
and then we justify content space
between space between like so. And then
we want to set the flex direction. So
flex direction and we want it to be in a
row. And whoops I also forgot the dot
here. Okay. So now we have this spacing
here. Super super cool. So everything is
justif content and so on so forth. Okay.
So, we'll revisit this CSS later. Um,
you know, it's it's really up to you how
you want to style it, but this will be
my model for now. So, what I'm going to
do is create a hidden class. And so,
I'll just add a comment here and I'll
call this model. And then I'll call this
one for experience. Experience. And then
everyone knows what this is for, so I'm
not going to leave a comment there. But
then we can have like utility utilities.
Um, and then one of them can be hidden.
And this will just be display none. And
now I can go back into index.html and
then just put the class of hidden here.
And that model is going to be hidden
now. So it still exists in the DOM.
We're just not seeing it now. Uh, but
we'll we'll fix that a little bit later.
Okay. Now let's create some content for
all our models. So uh let's just do it
in main.js and we can be organized
later. Um, so doesn't really matter
where you want to put it. Uh, I'll just
put it up here with the intersect stuff
and I'll just call it const modal
content equals an object. And we can
just have an object of objects. So let's
just copy in this right here. And then
let's place some cursors here with alt
and let's just create an object here.
And then let's add some commas here. And
then what we have is we have a
description. Um, and then if you want,
you can include the button text. Instead
of view project, you can like view
website, uh, view video or, you know,
whatever. Um, if you want to, you can
also add like custom classes in here.
So, like it would determine, you know,
which classes are shown on which
projects. Like maybe you don't want a
visit button on one of your projects
because there's no visit button or it's
like a view code button or something
like that. So, you could totally do that
if you want. I'm just going to keep it
really really simple. Um, so I'm just
going to have the title change. So I'll
just call it title. And I'll just leave
it uh all at project one right now.
Project one. And then we can have some
content. Whoops. We can have some
content. And we'll just say this is
project one. Uh, hello world.
And actually when I click on these, I
don't want them to pop up a model. So
I'm actually going to get rid of that.
It'll just be project one, project two,
and project three. Uh so now we need to
target the model
title and model project description. Uh
so what we can do is come over here and
just do const modal title equals
document doquery selector and it'll be
modal title. So let's just do title
and then let's just query selector the
content and then let's just query
selector the content. So we'll do model
project description
description equals model project
description. Project description.
And then we also need to target the
model close button. So let's do const
and I think I called it modal exit
button. Yeah. So maybe modal close
button would sound better. Whatever. Uh
let's just put it in here.
And let's do modal exit button. Doesn't
really matter. So now we have the three
HTML elements. We can add some event
listeners and also update the text of
you know the inner context the inner
text of those HTML elements. So let's
create a function here called show
model. And then when we show the model
on click we need to identify which
project it is. So we're going to take a
ID or a name in there. So what we're
going to do is do you can call it ID um
or call it name. I'm going to call it ID
cuz it's technically an ID. And then we
can just grab some content. So content
equals model content which is this
object right here. And then it will be
the ID like so. I'm going to assume so
we can have a small check here. If
content it exists then let's set the
model title. Model title which is this
right here. And we want to set its text
content
equal to the content.title.
So again, when we pass in a name here
that we click on like project one, it's
going to check here and grab this one
and grab this content. So content will
be returned is this one. And then we're
just doing content.title. So we're just
doing content. We're just doing the
content which is this object here.
Title. Super cool. And then we can do
modal project description uh text
content as well equals content and
content just like that. And then we can
just toggle the class list uh the hidden
class which is right here. Um so what we
can do is just do uh so actually we need
to grab the model first. So let's come
up here and let's just do model and
let's make this modal. And then what we
can do is just do model.class
list toggle. And we want to toggle the
hidden class. So because it's on there
by default, uh when we hit toggle and
click on it, um it'll remove the hidden
class and then it'll be visible. And of
course, we need something to hide it. So
we can just do function hide modal. And
we don't really need an ID here. We just
we can just set the model uh class list.
Whoops. We can just actually do this
just like just like this. So let's come
over to on click
right here instead of console.logging.
Well, we can leave that in if you want
for debugging purposes. We can just do
show modal and we can call intersect
object. But we don't want to do it on
every time we click just if intersect
object, right? Um, and we can just make
it explicit equal equal does not equal
equal an empty string. Then we can click
on show modal like so. So now if I click
on one of my pocket projects, you can
see it's project one. Project one. Oh
well, all of them say project one. So
let's actually adjust that right now so
we can see the difference. So let's call
this project two two. Let's control D
and project 3. Hello world. And now you
can see if I click project three project
project two project one. Just like that.
Super super cool. And then the exit
button doesn't work yet. So we can add
that as well. Whoops. I called this
exist button, but let's get rid of that.
And then let's just add an event
listener to this. So we can put it with
our other event listeners. And instead
of making it a window event listener,
all we can do is just do model.exit
button add eventlister. Click. And we
don't actually have to create another
one here. Uh we can just do hide model.
Hide model. That function right there
that we already created. So now when I
click here, I can click exit and it'll
close the model. Just like that. Super
super cool. Super super cool. All right.
One thing I forgot in here is the href
tag. So, let's come back and just um put
a hash here to go nowhere currently. And
let's go back into main. And I did add
another one here called chest. And then
for these three, what I'm going to do is
add a link here. So, and I'm just going
to use example.com as my URL. So, I'm
just going to copy that. And then for
these here, uh I'll just paste
example.com. And then for the chest,
it's just going to be about me modal.
It's going to use the same model, but
we're not going to have a link.
So, what we can do is target the the
model project visit button right here.
Um, we can just do shift alt down arrow
paste this here. And we can call this
model
project button. Then we don't want to
show the button if there's no link like
when it comes to when it comes to the
chest. So, so basically if content.link
link if it exists. Then we can do the
model project vis visit project button
and target its href and just set it
equal to content.link and then we can
also remove uh class list remove the
hidden class like so. And then we can
add it by default. So we can add the
hidden class over here by default. Again
that's display none in our CSS. Uh and
then otherwise uh we can just add it.
So now when I go back uh I just added
this in Blender. You can see there's no
link button here whereas there's still a
view project button here. Super super
cool. Now I don't want it to go and
refer out of the experience. So I want
it to open in a new tab. So what we can
do is add these two properties. Uh so
target_link to open in a new tab. And I
think by default now all browsers use no
opener. This is just like some security
sort of thing. Um but we might as well
just send it. We might as well just put
it explicitly anyway. So now when I
click on this view project, you can see
we got have a new link to whatever
project that you want. Uh yeah. So just
to show you, I just created a new chest
here and put it into my collection. Then
I just just shift selected everything.
File export. And since we had this, we
don't have to change anything. I just
renamed it portfolio, exported it, and
then just dragged it into my code and
everything worked out straight out of
the box. I also changed the images over
here. Um, but that is how some you would
add something if you wanted to. And then
in my main.js, I added chest into
intersect object names as well as the
motoral content because I wanted it to
pop up a mortal. Okay, so now I want our
character to kind of move like crossy
road chicken. Now we're not going to
make it exactly the same because there's
a lot of nuance here. You can see it's
like squashing and stretching and then
there's probably some easing with the
rotations and things like that. So it's
a little too complex for this tutorial,
but we're going to get the fundamental
basis of this movement. So if you have
no idea where to start, that's totally
okay. Um but you know the general advice
when you have a pro problem you can
solve like character movement in this
case you want to break it down into its
smaller steps. So let's say we want to
character movement just like crossy
road. How do we do that? Well the first
thing is we know how to target children
meshes right and we can see that in
their dot position. So we know that we
can adjust a position of like a camera
or an object in 3D space simply by
setting it to some sort of value. Right?
Now how do we get a event every time we
click on a button? Well, we know about
the key down event listener right we
also know that we can do dotrotation on
an object 3D and set its rotation to
something right like math.py or
something like that. So already just by
breaking down this complex thing into
smaller problems that we know about we
can already have a starting point to so
what we can do is start with a key down
and update our character's position and
rotation based on that key down value.
So let's go to our event listeners let's
shift alt down arrow here and let's do
key down and let's call this on key down
and let's just add it right here. So
function on key down and then if you're
not familiar with key down you can just
console log it or go into the
documentations
and now you can see when I do wd there's
this thing here called key that shows me
what key I'm pressing and then when I
use my arrow keys the key is um you know
arrow left arrow down and so on so
forth. So since some of them are
uppercase and some of them are lowerase
we don't want to type that out and worry
about it. So what we can do is just make
it to lowerase and then switch between
the keys that we press. We can create a
switch statement switch the event key
value and then we can just use the to
lowercase built-in JavaScript function
very very common. And then we can just
do case
uh w
and which is also case
arrow up arrow up like so. What we can
do temporarily is just set a break
statement here because first we actually
need to access our character again.
Let's come back into our loader
function. So remember this is the
callback to do things once we're done
loading. So if child so I named it
character. So if childname
equals equals equals character character
then let's set a variable called
character equal to the child. Oops. So,
let's create that. So, let's create all
this stuff. Um, you know, kind of
wherever you want. Uh, but I'm just
going to put it. Uh, so yeah, I'm just
going to put it here. And I'll just call
it let character. And I'll create an
object here. And I'll call the instance
of the character and just set it default
to null. And then we can also set our
move distance here. So, I'll just
Whoops, there should be a comma. And
then I'll set a move distance here. So,
how much we travel once we hit the
button. And I'll just set it at like
three or something, which we can always
change later. So now when I come back
here instead of character equals child
I'll do character.instance
equals set equal to the mesh that we
have. Uh so when I have wd right and I'm
viewing from this angle w is going to be
going that way or the up arrow. A is
going to be going that way. D is going
to be going that way and S is going to
be going that way. Now if you remember
our camera started here initially which
means we're actually looking at the
opposite opposite way. So, normally the
positive Z-axis is coming out the
screen, but since originally our Z-axis
was actually positive here, we're
actually looking at the negative Z
direction. So, S is going to be going in
the negative Z direction instead. We can
just do character.instance
instance.position.
And we can just do plus equal character
move just like this. And now when I go
back and hit W, it should work. Um, but
it doesn't probably because it's not
defined. Uh, so either this is
misspelled or something else is and
indeed here it is. So this should be
character like so. Now it still doesn't
work because I forgot to add the Z here.
So this should be Z like so. And now you
can see when I hit W, I'm moving in the
Z direction. Right? So if I do that for
all of them, I can come shift alt down
arrow shift alt down arrow shift alt
down arrow. And then I can call this s
arrow down and then we can minus instead
here. Then we can do a which is arrow
left arrow left. We can go x and that
will be in the positive direction. And
then here we can subtract. So this will
be s uh sorry d and this will be arrow
right. Now you can see we already have
some basic controls. Just like that.
Pretty pretty cool. And then you know
just for semantic clarity we can have a
default which is just you know do
nothing return. Okay. So we don't need
to log this anymore. Okay. Now we
clearly have an issue. Uh we don't want
it to just like jump to the next
position. You know we wanted to smoothly
go from one point to the other. So if we
go back we kind of did everything right.
But now we hit another roadblock. You
know our character is just jumping from
one place to another. When you Google
it. Uh, I'll just speed up the research
process for you by telling you. You'll
realize that what's happening is that
we're just setting it on one frame,
right? So, we're just adding plus two to
the movement and it's going from here to
here. Now, if you remember what I said
about um request animation frame and how
I like to view it as like like a movie
strip or film strip like this, what
we're doing essentially is just having
like you know two frames and we're just
adding two. So it's becomes
instantaneous from one frame to another.
But in reality, what we want is to have
the starting position and a target or
ending position and then just let the
software do it for us in between. So
slightly over here, slightly more over
to the right, slightly probably in the
center here, a little bit to the right,
and then a little bit more to the right,
and then over here will be the final
target position. That way we kind of
have a smooth thing. And of course, the
more frames you have, the more smooth
it's going to look. And uh that's why in
games people really really like the
frames per second metric. You know,
gamers like high high frames per second,
right? You know, if you start lowering
your frame per second, you know, you're
going to start getting a little bit
jaggedy and it kind of looks laggy and
it's a little bit annoying and
frustrating to play. Of course, you also
have like stop animation motions which
are usually in like 15 frames per
second. So, you also have like, you
know, your stylistic choices there as
well. Okay, so ideally what we want is
just having a starting and an ending
position and let our 3D software or in
this case 3GS kind of take care of the
rest and which we call interpolation. So
if you look up interpolation, the broad
idea of it is just constructing new data
points based on a range of known data
points. So if we know the ending
position and we know the starting
position, then we can use some sort of
interpolation method. There's very
different kinds of interpolation methods
to figure out everything in between
those frames for us. If I go into
Blender, let's say this is my cube
starting point. I'll hit insert a c
frame. Go to like 20 frames. Go gy and
then hit another key frame. All
channels. You can see we only have a
starting position and an ending
position. But when I hit place, you can
you can see we only have a starting
position and an ending position. But
when I hit play, the cube is somehow
going there rather like in 3GS where it
just teleports there. And that's because
of the interpolation mode. So, and it's
because if I right click here,
interpolation mode, I think by default
is busier. So, you can see there's no
change there. However, if I change it to
something like constant, now we get what
3GS gets. We just instantly go there.
Now, here we're delaying it. We're
waiting 20 frames before we go there.
But in 3GS, it's just like putting it at
two. So, if I move this at two, for
example,
it'll just jump uh as soon as I, you
know, as soon as I hit my key spacebar
or in 3GS I hit W, it's just
instantaneously going to go to the next
frame there. Okay. So, then that kind of
begs the question, how can we use our
animate function or our window request
animation frame, which is what it's
using internally, to facilitate a
starting and ending position? Well,
there would be a lot of stuff we need if
we were to do it by ourselves. Now, if
we were to do it ourselves, there would
be a lot of things that we need. And I
was considering doing it for this video,
but I felt like it was too intermediate
or too difficult for a beginner course.
So, we're going to take a look at an
alternative. So, we're going to use an
animation library. Again, it's just
JavaScript that someone else wrote
called Gap, which is a really popular
way to animate things on the on the web.
Basically, it gives us syntax for us to
use in JavaScript. helps us animate
things a lot easier than us having to do
it ourselves because it also has a
built-in window request animation frame.
It also has a bunch of internal
properties and internal commands that
kind of just figure things out for us.
For example, if we set our rotation to
math.py, for example, we don't have to
we don't have to use our own math
functions. And if we want a jump
animation, we don't have to use the
math.sign animation. It kind of take
cares of that for us by default. and
they also do the linear interpolation
for all of these behind the scenes.
Additionally, Gap is very very popular
in the creative development space and
the design engineering space. So, it's
kind of good to know Gap anyway. We'll
be doing more complicated custom things
in future videos, but for this beginner
course, we're just going to be using
Gab. So, let's come to this page in the
documentation and grab the Gab CDN.
That way, we can use Gab in our code.
Let's come back to index.html HTML and
just put it right here and like so. And
now we can just use GAP. Now, we don't
have to import them like we did for
three because we're not using an import
map. Uh we're just using the CDN
directly. So, if you want to, you can
update it to an import map and then call
it GAP and then do import GAP from GSAP
just for consistency. But I'm just going
to use it straight out of the box
because we don't have to do that.
Similarly, you don't actually have to do
that for 3GS either, but they did that
in their doc, so I'm kind of just
leaving it that way. Okay, so despite
Gap saving a lot of time and a lot of
effort, there's still a few parameters
that we kind of need. So, one will still
be the move distance and of course the
instance as well. We also need like a
jump height. So, we can like set that as
a default of one. We also still need to
determine if it's moving or not. That
way, we don't keep on replaying the GSAP
animation. Set that as false. And
whoops, I keep putting semicolons here.
And then we can also have a move
duration that we can tell GSAP how long
we want it to take. So we can just do
move duration and we can set it at like
0.2 seconds or 200 milliseconds. Now
again, if we were doing this ourselves,
we would need a lot more than what we
have here. Okay. So let's go to our key
down event and let's set our target
rotations and positions that will update
on key down. Then we'll use gap to take
our current rotation and location and go
it to our new location and rotations. So
the first thing we want to check is when
we press down a key is it moving and if
it is moving if it is moving we don't
want to trigger another animate event.
Right? So we have this guard clause here
and we'll just return immediately. If
the thing is moving just return don't
execute anything below here. Now, the
moment we press down our key, we already
know the target rotation, right? Cuz we
hit W and then we're just adding two to
that target rotation. But our target
rotation needs to be relative to our
starting rotation. So, in order for
that, what we do is const target
position like so. And we'll do a new
three dot vector 3 like here, like here.
And then we can just copy the
character.instance.position.
And if you log out the type of position
of any object 3D, it's going to be a
type of vector 3, which is just an X, a
Y, and a Z. Just like that. So, we're
copying the current character instance
of the target position, which we're
going to update with a key. And then for
the rotation, we're not adding to the
rotation. We're just rotating to that
specific value. So, for us, we can just
do target rotation and just leave it as
a default of zero. How does that make
sense? Well, I don't know the exact
directions here, but let's say if I
rotate this way, I'm going 90°. And then
if I go this way, I'm rotating negative
90°. And then if I'm here, by default,
I'm at 0°. And then if I rotate this
way, I'm at 180°. Now, when let's say I
go up, then I'm rotated 90°. When I
rotate right, I'm not adding 90° here.
Instead, I'm just rotating to 180°. But
since I'm already at 90, it's going to
act like I just added 90. Now, the
reason we're doing it this way is
because rotations can start getting
confusing if you start adding to them.
Like, let's say you want to go from 90
to90.
Do you take the short route and go from
90 to 0 to90? Or do you take the other
way and make 90 go to 180 and then 180
go to 270, which is going to have the
same result as 90. So, it kind of get
becomes a mess, which is why we just go
to that specific rotation rather than
adding or subtracting. So, I'll just do
control D control D to select all those
instances and do target position. And
then for their target rotation, uh I'm
just going to set it to some value,
which I don't actually know if they're
right or not. So, we can always just
change it later. I'm going to assume
since our camera was facing uh this way
first that this rotation will be zero
when we hit W, this rotation will be
this is a Z-axis in the positive
direction coming towards us. So, I'm
going to assume our character is already
default rotated. We could confirm that
if we wanted to, but I don't, you know,
we can, it's just faster if we just type
it. So, I'm going to set this as zero.
This one will be math.py going in the
negative Z direction. And then this one,
since again, we're viewing it from this
way, uh, by default we're looking at
this way, which means X positive
direction is going right. So, if we hit
the left arrow key, that means we want
to go in the positive X direction. So,
we're rotating it 90°. And then here we
just want to go into the negative x
direction which is what we have here.
And that's also kind of highlighted by
our symbols here. They kind of already
give us the direction. So I think we
intuitively got it correct. Okay. Now we
can create uh another function um that
will just move our character. So let's
come over here and let's just well we
can put it anywhere. I just do function
and I'll call it move character. And
it'll take our target position right and
our target rotation like so. And then we
can pass that in. So every time we key
down when it's not moving, we want to
call the move character function. So we
can just do move character. And then we
can pass in our target position and our
target rotation just like this into our
move character function. Now we don't
want it in the default. We want it out.
So just make sure you're not in the
switch statement, which I am
accidentally in the switch statement. So
let me just move that outside of there.
Okay. So as soon as this is triggered
that means is moving is true. So we can
set is moving equal to true. Right?
Okay. So the next thing I want to do is
create a gap timeline. And it kind of
sounds scary. If you need a visual
representation, you can just go into the
Blender timeline and kind of visualize
it like this. Or if you use Premiere Pro
or some sort of video editing software,
you know, you've kind of seen a timeline
before. So let's just call it const. And
it's pretty standard to call it T1 for
timeline one. and gap time. Whoops.
GSAP. timeline. And if we want to add
key frames to this timeline, we can use
a lot of different methods, but we're
going to be using two, which means we're
taking some initial state and heading to
there. So, we're going to we're going to
take our initial character
instance.position.
We're going to set its X. So, basically
what we're doing here X is basically
doingX here. And we're going to set that
equal to the target position dox.
Again, that's a vector 3 right here.
Right? We're just targeting the x value
of the vector 3. And then here, this x
is targeting the value of the
character's position. And then, of
course, we also want the z direction.
And we're going to do target position.
Z. Then we can set the duration,
right? And we're just going to set that
to move duration, which we put at the
top. And that will be character domove
duration like so. And we can do the same
thing for the rotation. So let's just
copy this, but instead of the position,
we'll just grab the rotation. And this
time we're only rotating along the
y-axis. So we can just do y. And then
there it's not a vector 3. It's just a
value. So we can just instead just do
target rotation here. So I also forgot
that is moving is part of our character.
So we need to do characterism moving.
Character is moving here as well. So now
if I go back, you can see when I hit my
character, it moves and then it rotates.
However, I can't actually press any
other keys after that. Now the reasons
that's happening is because when this
triggers, we set it to true, which means
every time we press our key again, it'll
just keep returning and never execute
again. So what we kind of need to do is
tell GSAP when it's done playing this to
do some sort of action. And luckily for
us, if you look at the docs, Gub has
this really awesome cool thing called
onmplete. And basically, it runs a
callback function to do something when
your timeline is completed. So, all we
can do is just character do is moving
moving and set that back to false.
However, there's still an issue. When we
move, it moves and then rotates. That's
kind of weird. We want them to play at
the same time. So the way to do that is
just by putting zero here in the order
value and it'll just play them at the
same time. So now you can do this
and you can see it rotates as we move.
Now again I'm just kind of telling you
what features GEP has but normally if
you had that issue you'd look it up and
then you would eventually figure this
out. However, I'm just telling you that
um but you know over time you can
develop your own intuition. Now I do see
one issue when I go with my D key. It's
going in the right direction, but it's
rotating wrongly. So, if I go back here,
indeed, I do mess that up. So, it should
be divided by two, not negative math.
And now when I go back, you can see that
we have everything working. Super super
cool. Just like that. All right. So, now
let's make our character jump. So, we
can just copy and paste this and move it
down here. And of course, we want zero.
So, all three of these play at the same
time. Even though they look like there's
an order here, all of them will play at
the same time. And again, we have the
position.
And this time, we do want the Y
position. And the position that we're
going to is the current is the character
instances position of Y plus our
character jump height, which we set
earlier up above. So now, if I go back
to the browser, you can see that indeed
it's working. However, the issue we see
now here is that we always take our
initial height, which never resets, and
keep adding to it. So now what we have
is a flying character. So the way to fix
that is actually with yo-yo. So this
comes with the gap which is really
really nice and it's called yo-yo. And
just like it sounds like we just set it
to true and then we set repeat equal to
one. If you think that's too slow you
can divide by two. I think what yo-yo
does is it will play the duration to
that movement and then again back when
it yo-yos. So what we can just do is
just divide by two. And then now when I
go back you can see that the jump kind
of matches when we land and when we
start so on and so forth. it doesn't
stay floating in the air. You'll also
notice when I hold down a key, it's only
going to play the next animation when is
moving is true again. Sorry, when is
moving is false again. Then it'll
trigger the true. That way we don't have
a bunch of spamming um which will mess
up the animation. Again, you know, I'm
just telling you this stuff, but like
take some time to explore with the Gap
timeline. You can see in the
documentation, they kind of have the
callbacks that you can put in your gap
timeline. For example, here we used on
complete. Um, so on so forth. There's
also other stuff here like on start. So
when your timeline starts, do you want
to trigger something? You could trigger
an animation in the scene. Um, so you
kind of have a a lot of options when it
comes to the Gap timeline. Uh, yeah. So
I mean, your portfolio is pretty much
done. I mean, if you just want to deploy
this, you could totally be happy with
that uh, and not watch the rest of the
video. just make sure people know how to
move around with like instructions or
like a small HTML popup or something
like that. However, I will be continuing
on with a few extra features that I want
to add. Uh there is still going to be
somewhat beginner friendly but maybe a
little bit more towards the intermediate
side. So, I'll explain it a little bit
faster and a little more brief now, but
hopefully uh but if you want to call it
a day, if you want to explore things on
your own and um yeah, you can totally do
that. And uh for those people, you know,
thanks so much for watching and I hope
to see you in my next video, but for the
others, I'm going to be continuing on.
Uh yeah, so I just added a small on
click to our intersect objects.
Originally, it was just show model, but
now I'm just checking, okay, if the
intersect object we clicked on was
Bulbasaur, chicken, or Pikachu. You
could use if statements here and just
use if equals equal equals Bulbasaur or
I just did this way. No reason in
particular. And then I added this
function here called jump character
which is just another gap timeline that
I created. And basically I'm using this
3GS thing here called get object by
name. And since we're passing in the
string which is also the name of our
mesh can just use scene.get object by
name rather than traversing the whole
thing to find equals equals equals. Uh
we use traverse here because we wanted
to target all the children and set their
cast shadows and receive shadows. And
then instead of using find after since
we already have a traverse we might as
well just use and check for the name.
But if you wanted to you could totally
have done like go.cene.find
and then set the character instance to
the find. So if you put in character
here you could set the character
instance to that like if you wanted to.
Um sorry I meant get object by name. I
think find is also one but I it might
work a little bit differently. Um, but
yeah, I just made another Gab timeline
to take that scale and do some stuff
with it. You can see I have some easing
functions here and things like that.
Yeah, so if you want, you can just take
a look at the code and see what I did
there. But yeah, so we kind of have
something a little bit cute here. Uh, if
you need help with that, you know,
definitely reach out. I can clarify and
explain what I did there. Uh, but I
encourage you to look through the GAP
documentation and try and understand
what I did there initially. I will say I
did not introduce a state here. So if
you click on it while it's animating,
you can see it's going to start
glitching out. And honestly, I'm just
going to leave that in as the Easter egg
because I think it's kind of funny. I
also say most people are probably not
going to click on it twice in a row cuz
it goes up and then you miss it. So you
have to click it when it comes back
down. Very few people are going to like
click it halfway in and kind of do that.
Maybe they will, but then it'll just be
funny. Uh you'll also notice that when I
go to the rotation of 180 and then go to
the rotation of negative math pi / 2
or9°, it's taking the long way around
rather than the short way around. Uh so
you can use math to fix that. Uh yeah,
and that's pretty much what I just did
here. If you want me to walk you through
this, you know, feel free to reach out.
But here, I just shift the ranges of our
rotations to always find the shortest
rotation. And instead of using our
target rotation as the target rotation,
we're using this final rotation here.
And now you can see when I go 180 and go
into 270 where 90° everything is taking
the shortest path and we don't get those
crazy rotations like we used to. Okay,
the next thing I wanted to talk about is
collision detection. Now I'm just going
to be telling you some of the methods,
but when you Google these, when you
Google like 3JS collision detection
online, these are the kinds of things
that you'll see. The so the first one
you'll see is like ABB uh collision
testing which is basically checking if
bounding boxes of objects overlap and
then doing something with that sort of
information. So like in video games if
you have a character like let's imagine
you're playing Valerant or CS GO or some
first person shooter like Call of Duty
your hitbox is not the person itself.
Your hitbox is actually some other some
other more standardized object like a
rectangle or something. So when someone
is shooting at you, you know, it might
go between your arm and between your leg
visually, but it'll still considered as
you getting hit and you would lose some
HP points. Right now, the reason games
don't like to use the person themselves
as the collision determination is
because that would increase so much more
mathematical calculations and take a hit
on performance. Obviously, for some
games, they will use the entire body to
detect collisions because they kind of
need that mechanic, but a lot of games
they don't. And people often refer to
this as like hit boxes or things like
that. So the idea is again since these
are you know bounding boxes in 3D space
that no one can see well that means they
have they're made of a bunch of points
which means if one bounding box you know
which is made of it it's a bunch of
points if it's overlapping this bounding
box then if a point inside here is
overlapping a point inside here then we
just detect oh it's a collision and then
we can react to that. So this is kind of
like a highle explanation of this one.
Uh, another really popular thing is to
use a nav mesh. So, basically what a nav
mesh is is imagine like you create a
ground. Like you can have everything
whatever you want, but you only you
create a ground that again is unvisible
and your character can walk on this nav
mesh. Basically, since we are moving,
you know that we already know the target
position, right? As soon as we hit a
key, we already know the target
position. So, you take that target
position, right? Let's say I hit, you
know, W. So I want to go this way and
it's not on the nav mesh. So if I ray
cast directly down from my target
position, it'll show that the raycaster
is not intersecting with my nav mesh. So
we can cancel that movement. Now there's
a lot more complexity here, but that's
kind of the general idea for a nav mesh.
And then another thing is again using
ray caster, but except you know whatever
direction the character is moving. For
example, here we can have like a wall
here or something like this. And
basically the ray cer will determine the
length of your intersection from your
character to the wall. So let's say
right here it's like one distance of one
and then as your character gets closer
let's say over here well then the
distance between the ray and the wall
collision is I don't know like 0.1 and
then again if the target position if the
target position will go below 0.1 it
means we would go inside the wall. So
instead of continuing the movement we
just cancel it. So again, this is kind
of like a raycast caster method like so.
Then you have like physics engines like
Canon.js, amo.js and things like that.
Um they'll do a lot of the mathematical
calculations for you. So not really much
to illustrate here other than if you
want to take a look at some of the
examples with Canonjs and AMO.js, you
totally can. Now, if you wanted to go
for like a really really primitive and
basic collision detection system, you
know, let's say you have like a box
here, uh, you know, you can just check,
you know, if player is within this range
and this range and this range and this
range, allow them to move, otherwise
don't. So, here you just have a bunch of
if statement checks. It's not really
detecting collision, just detecting if
your character is within a specific
range. Now, this will get extremely bad
when you have complex routes and
everything, but if it's like a box, like
that would totally work, but you know,
let's say you have like different paths
and things like that, you would have to
manage like, okay, if they're between
this X and Y range, they can only move
through this box or over here, they can
only move through this box and so on so
forth. So, and then if you have
obstacles, it becomes even more
confusing. So, and there's the method
that we're going to be using uh called
an Octry, which is like a data
structure. Uh you don't really have to
know about that if you don't want to. Um
but basically imagine you have a scene
here and a bunch of objects like here,
here, here, here, here. Imagine you have
a character like this and on every frame
you're detecting collisions with all
these objects just to make sure there's
movement. That would be very performance
intensive. So an Octry kind of divides
up your stuff like so.
Um I'm not doing it to scale or
accurate, but basically it divides it.
And if your character is within, you
know, one of these divisions, then it
will only check for collisions inside
here. So if there's like an obstacle
here, it only check for a collision
there rather than the entire scene. So
it kind of improves performance a little
bit there. Okay, so now you might be a
little bit confused and a little bit
overwhelmed and you're like, okay,
there's so many collision methods. Why
are there so many collision methods? How
am I going to determine what to choose?
You know, what are the pros and cons and
things like that? And there's probably
more collision methods that I didn't
list here and things like that. And in a
lot of projects if you want to you can
sometimes combine different methods uh
like using a simple one or in some areas
and then using this in other areas. And
then if your client wants something
really quick even though it's simple you
know you might use a really bulky
physics engine which will take a hit on
performances but it'll be a lot quicker
to implement than some of these other
methods. So you so much complexity and
it's like which one do I choose? Which
one do I work with? How do I know about
these? To answer that question, I just
want to say like don't even worry about
it. You're just starting out. Don't even
worry about this stuff. Don't worry
about optimization. Don't even worry
about anything. Just know the method.
Try and do a little bit of research and
then just try and create something with
that method. And then you'll just get
better with it over time and then you'll
improve your workflow and kind of just,
you know, gain it with experience. What
I see a lot of people do is they kind of
get overwhelmed and then they kind of
just give up rather than doing
something. doing something and failing
at it and learning from that is
definitely better than just never trying
at all. You know, don't be afraid to
fail. You will fail. I failed a hundred
times recording videos 100 times when I
create websites. Uh you just kind of see
the finished polished product. But over
time, you know, you'll kind of develop
it and when you start working with
people, people will like question your
design choices and they'll suggest
alternative workflows and then you can
take that into consideration and things
like that. So yeah, don't worry about
it. Just have fun. focus on creating
things and um over time you'll develop
your intuition and and you'll be all
good to go. Okay, so let's go back into
Blender and create our collider mesh.
Now, if you want to go to the file where
before you join them, you totally could.
Uh but what I'm going to do just because
I'm going to mess up everything is just
do file and save incremental right now.
And then what I want to do is select ctr
L to select my entire ground plane and
hit P and separate by selection. That
way we kind of just have something
easier to work with. Then I'm going to
go into top view, go into edit mode, go
into wireframe, and kind of just box
select uh my level like so. And then I'm
going to hold control and like box
select the areas that I know I can never
walk on. So you could totally do under
the tree as well if you wanted to. So
now what we can do is shift D and then P
separated by selection. I right click
cancel the movement. So now what we have
is the collider. So we can call this
ground collider
like so. And then we can just actually
just delete all this other stuff because
we don't need it. Let's go back to
material preview. So, this is going to
be our collider. So, we actually don't
need any materials at all.
And then for the rest of the scene, we
can just use primitive objects. We don't
want to use the objects themselves. We
just want to use primitive objects
because it'll be a lot more performant
than using the objects themselves,
right? Like instead of having like six
different objects here and you know like
one here and one here, we can just use a
single box. So, what I'm going to do is
shift right click, shift A, add a plane
like here. And just kind of like scale
it up arbitrarily like so. SX. And this
will kind of be the hitbox area or the
collision detection for this. And this
will be like that. And then I just want
to extrude it upwards a little bit like
here. If you want to change how this
looks, you can come into object and then
go into viewport display and instead of
textured, set it as bounds. That way you
can kind of see it a little bit better.
But I don't really mind that much. So,
I'm just going to change this back to
textured. You know, don't forget to
delete the bottom face. Not really a big
deal, but you know, might as well save
us some memory. Um, again, if you don't
like how this box is, you know,
consistent with here because this is
kind of inside a little bit more and
this fence is a little bit out, you can
totally adjust the geometry uh to, you
know, putt it inwards if you want to.
I'm not going to. Uh, but you can if you
want to. I'm just going to keep
everything really, really simple.
So, I'm just going to do this. I'm going
to do the same thing here. And if
they're clipping through the sign,
that's totally okay. But if you want to,
you can totally make a like a hit box
here as well, uh, for the sign. Or
adjust this one and like extrude it out.
Um, honestly, I don't really mind that
much. Um, yeah, just kind of be
Yeah, honestly, it doesn't really
matter. Uh, just make your bounding
boxes how you want to do how you want to
do them. Uh, for example, like for the
flowers, for the benches, you might put
some. for the rocks. You might put some
or you can just let them clip in between
it. You know, it's really up to you. Uh
it's really up to you and what you want
to do with your scene and what you're
okay with them clipping through and
whatnot. All right. So, I kind of have
all my collision stuff there. Okay. And
now we need the walls so we don't, you
know, go out of the stuff and things
like that. So, what we can do, um, if
you want, we do have the topology here
to just extrude. So if I go into top
view and go into wireframe and like you
can see like I can like hold control to
get the shortest path and just add it
with control. The issue with this method
here is because I didn't really snap to
grid. So you can see there's a
misalignment. So for example if I add
over here um you can see that my
character would be over here but then
over here it would start clipping
inside. So obviously you can adjust that
after you extrude upwards or if you use
a grid system it would be consistent all
around and you wouldn't have to deal
with that. So, instead of just doing
that here, I'm just going to create a
plane. So, I'm just going to shift right
click, add a plane here. I'm going to do
R Y90. You can start it wherever you
want. Uh, then I'm going to go into edit
mode, GZ, move it up a little bit, GZ,
and then snap it with face snapping onto
there. So, the origin point is there.
Doesn't really matter though. Then I'll
just scale it up to get a height that I
want. It doesn't have to be the height
of the tree. Yeah. And now we can just
go into top view, go into wireframe, go
into edit mode, and then just extrude
this out. So, this one actually I'm not
extruding. I'm just going to gy. But
then here, I'll extrude. So E and then
I'll lock it on the X axis. Kind of move
it over here. Um
E and then lock it on the Y axis again.
Again, and then I'm going to E X again.
Uh again, my collision is not perfectly
symmetrical on all of them. But again,
it doesn't really matter. Uh, I'll also
say like depending on the camera angle,
you might actually want to increase the
collision on one side compared to the
other because if you put them like the
same distance here and the camera is
angled in a way, it kind of completely
hides your character. Now, there's other
ways to get rid of that, like making
your mesh see through and things like
that, but that's a complexity for
another day, but that's also a design
choice you could totally make if you
wanted to.
Um, so I'm just going to do ey and uh
whoops, not gy
and uh gy.
And then I feel like this original stud
is a little too close. So I'm just going
to gx move this out a little bit. Um,
move this a little bit. And then ey
again like here. And then ex like here.
And then for these last ones, I'll just
do sxx0 just to make them perfectly
aligned on the x-axis. You could also
turn on vertex snapping and snap them.
But now they're perfectly aligned. And
then we can merge these vertices. So
again, from the side view, we'll do m
and then we'll do at last, which is the
last one you selected. So this one
first, then this one. This is the last
one we selected. And we just do at last.
So now if we go into material preview,
you can see that. Okay, we created some
walls here. Super super cool. Now again,
we need to check our face direction. So
make sure everything is blue. This is
not blue, but all the other ones are
great. So we go into edit mode. A a N
and flip. Just like that. So now
everything is blue where we want to
detect. And then you can see I have some
things messed up here. So I can just
move that a little bit there. Um but now
we can join all our stuff into a single
object. Let's make sure just to move it
around to make sure we're not missing
anything. We can also turn off face
orientation. Now select our ground. And
it looks like we got all our collided
stuff. And then with the ground as the
active object, we can just do Ctrl + J
and join everything. So we go back into
local view. This is our collider object
that we're going to be detecting
collisions with. And then of course you
can always edit it. Um, so if I go out,
you can see that this tree level is the
same, but this wall is not the same
level as this wall. So I can come up
here, turn on vertex snapping, and just
like gy lock it, and then snap it to
this vertex. Oops, I accidentally went
to the ground. Gy. Yeah, this one right
here. another even amount consistency.
This might be clo too close to the
trees, so I might do gy and then move it
out a little bit. I don't know. Really
up to you there. And of course, now that
we know that we'll never go outside, you
can totally go into wireframe and kind
of start deleting some of these some of
these extra faces here uh that are
behind the wall because we'll never need
them. So, we can save some memory.
Like so. Like so. Control. And then
maybe maybe over here we can hold
control
here as well.
Delete these faces. Okay, sweet. And I
accidentally deleted the rest of the
level. So I made a mistake there
unfortunately. That's totally fine. We
can just move this into a new collection
called collider.
And this is why we do save incremental
because when we make mistakes it's
totally okay. We can just go file open
recent. I called it before exporting
two. So, I'll just save this file. And
here we have our original thing that I
exported. Let's do file. Let's do
append.
And the incremental one is before
exporting three. So, we can double click
that. Go into collection. And then look
for our collider. So, we collider. So,
we just add it. And now it's just added
to our scene just like this. Now, let's
take this out and just drag it into its
own. Not that that matters, but it's
just cleaner that way. Now, we can just
select everything, do file, export,
gltf. We can name this portfolio now.
And we don't have to touch anything here
because we already have this. And then
we just hit export. It'll replace over
our old portfolio GB. If you want to
version it, you can totally do that like
underscore v1 or underscore with
collider. And I'm just going to drag
this in here and replace this. You know,
generally when you're working, you don't
want to replace things because you might
make a mistake and things like that and
you want to trace your steps. Uh but for
us, I kind of already know what I'm
going to be doing, so I'm just going to
replace. uh you know but when you're
working on a real project just consider
like okay are you really confident that
what you're changing is correct if it is
yes you can replace it but if not then I
recommend versioning it so you kind of
have a fallback so what I'm going to do
is actually create another file called
with GAP with GAP we're getting rid of
GAP primarily because we have
differences in elevation right so this
here is a little bit higher than this
here right here so in order to account
for that when using octry it's better to
have like gravity system in place rather
than gap where we set an initial Y and
an ending Y and it just goes to that
value and resets because what we have to
do is like raycast down on the target
position realize that it's initial Y is
going to be higher than this platform
and then add it to the GAP timeline and
then same thing when we go downwards in
other words you know using GAP with the
OxRY method is kind of tedious when we
have different heights and elevation if
it was just like a flat plane and
everything was on the same level, then
we actually wouldn't even need the
ground plane at all. We would just need
this cube here and the walls. We
wouldn't need the grass here or the path
here or anything else because everything
would be flat and the Gab will always go
back to that same level anyway
automatically, which is what we did. But
since we have different heights and
elevation, you know, it's going to be
really hard with Gab. So, we might as
well just get rid of it. I did mention
earlier in the video that custom
controls is a lot more complex than
using GSAP. So, I'll try my best to
explain what I'm doing and hopefully it
kind of makes some sense. So, the really
awesome thing with 3GS examples though
is that they actually have an example
here with the Octry implemented. And
this is kind of why I also chose this
method to do just because there's an
example on it. And I kind of wanted to
talk about how you can learn from
something that you have no idea where to
get started or where to even look. So I
went to the examples and typed in FPS.
And if you click this code button, it'll
take you to the code, which I also have
open here. But so when it was the first
time I wanted to implement something
like this, I was just like, okay, how do
I even do that? You know, this looks
incredibly complex. How am I ever going
to figure that out? I wish I just had a
teacher to just teach me this stuff, but
then I couldn't afford a teacher. So how
do you learn something like this on your
own? Today, you could probably copy and
paste this into AI and get a fairly
decent explanation. However, sometimes
you won't get any sort of explanation at
all. So, in that case, you have to do it
the old way where you just copy and
paste everything into a new file and
then on the things that you do know
about like here, you can comment on
them. You're like, ""Oh, we're sending
the shadow camera, so on and so forth,
blah blah blah."" So, you know what this
does, so you can pretty much quote
unquote ignore it. You can leave it in
the code, but pretty much ignore it.
Same thing here. It's like, ""Oh, I
already know what this does. I'm just
going to ignore that."" So on so forth.
Now, what if you see something that you
don't recognize or you're questioning
why it's there? Well, you might not know
immediately what it is. So, you can kind
of leave a comment there and then to
come back to it. Or what you can do is
actually uncomment it and get rid of it.
And if something breaks, you're like,
""Oh, okay. Maybe I should try something
else."" Instead of commenting it out, you
can like change this to like 50 and then
go back and then like see, okay, what
did that change? Or something like that.
And then over time, the more you try and
fail, you'll eventually start connecting
the dots over and over. Like I can
distinctly remember when I was first
working with this code and first
learning it on my own. I had literally
no idea what I was looking at. I was
like what even is this? You know this is
crazy and so on so forth. And if you
don't understand it after a while you
know definitely go up and search on like
3JS Discord forums and ask for help
there and someone will answer. Now I
kind of know like okay this is like the
starting position of the capsule. This
is the head of the capsule and this is
like the radius of it. Uh, so basically
they're using a capsule. I said
originally that if like let's say you
have a character, you have like a
bounding box. Um, but you can also use
like a sphere or something or you can
use a capsule that kind of looks like a
pill. And what it's doing is it's start
setting this starting point on the first
point and then the ending point at the
top and then it's setting a radius of
0.35. So around here and it kind of
creates that capsule shape just like
that. Now, the reason they're using a
capsule instead of like a rectangle or
sphere is another technical detail, but
a capsule kind of represents a person
better, which is why they're using a
capsule. And then as you go through it,
you can actually get rid of entire
functions just to like simplify what
you're actually looking at. Cuz when I
was like first doing this, I was like,
""Okay, I don't really care about this
throwing ball thing. I'll just add on to
it later."" So, what I did was I get rid
of throw ball and then all the errors
that call throw ball, all the functions
that call it. So, everything would just
function without the throwing ball
feature. And then I could like actually
focus on what I was doing. Same thing
here. I did like I don't know what this
is doing at all. But then I commented it
out and then I realized that when I hit
the walls, I no longer get slidy walls.
Like right now I'm sliding against the
walls. But with this gone, it was no
longer sliding against the walls. So I
was like, okay, I don't understand the
math here. At least I know what it does.
Same thing here. It's just like, yeah, I
don't understand this math function at
all. So uncomment it, remove damping,
see what that does. How does that affect
things? But basically the idea is you
don't have to understand the syntax or
even how it's connected. I mean
eventually you will, but like the idea
is to kind of just like figure out what
you know and then piece it back together
until you figure out everything. Just
because you don't know how something
works doesn't mean you don't know what
it does. And as long as you know what
that something does, you'll eventually
know how that thing works. So I'm going
to be implementing and sort of
explaining but also sort of learning at
the same time. And hopefully you can
follow along a little bit and try and
use your intuition to see if it kind of
matches up with mine. Let's just take a
snapshot in our brain. You know, some
things that we need. Uh so I recommend
you also have this open, but I'll keep
mine open on the side and kind of just
talk about it when I'm coding. Okay. So
the first thing we want to do is update
our imports. So I'm just going to copy
this from their GitHub code. So here we
have our capsule and our oct tree.
Again, if you want, you can look at the
GitHub repo to find the Octry code and
the cap tree capsule code if you want to
dive deep into it. Uh, and then we need
some physics stuff. So, I'll just call
this physics stuff. Um, like here we
have our character stuff here, but we
can also have physics stuff. Uh, so we
definitely need a gravity, which I'll
leave all caps like they do. So, I'll do
it at 30. And then maybe we have the
capsule radius here as well. They had it
at 0.35. So, I'm just going to hope that
works. But, we can also change that as
well. Then we can have a capsule height.
Oops. Capsule height. And we can set
that as one, which is what they had for
theirs. And we can have like the jump
height. So we can do like jump height.
And we can set it like 15. It's also
technically a force, but I'm just going
to call it height. And then we can have
like a move speed. And I'll just set
that at like one for now. But, you know,
it doesn't really matter. We can change
that later. Um, we could use is moving
or we could like can move. um doesn't
particularly matter, but since we have
jump height here and move distance here,
we can actually just get rid of this
here. Uh and we don't need move distance
anymore. And we don't need move duration
either. Okay, cool. So, we might need
something a little bit later, but this
should be okay for now, at least
intuitively. And then we need to create
our oct tree. So, I'll just call const
collider oct tree. And it'll be a new
oct tree like so. And then we can create
our player collider, the capsule that's
going to follow our player. So we'll
just do const player collider equals
whoops new capsule and it takes two
vector 3. So the starting position. So
new three. Whoops. 3 dot vector 3.
Whoops. Vector 3. So for the starting
height uh of the capsule, which is the
bottom half. Remember when I drew that
capsule, we're just going to start it at
the capsule radius, right? Because the
capsule radius itself will fill up and
hit the ground for us. And then we don't
want in X or Y. We just want it straight
up and down. And then we can copy and
paste this like so for the ending point.
Except this time we'll do the capsule
height rather than the capsule radius.
And then for the capsule radius, well,
we can just set it to the capsule
radius, which is the third parameter
here. So again, just to recap, we have
our capsule radius 0.35. And then we
have our capsule height, which is right
here, and our capsule start, which is
right here. And then we have the radius
of 0.35 around here. So we have our
capsule around our character. Uh
straight up and down. This isn't a good
drawing, but you get the idea. Um and
then we might need a variable to check
if the player's on the floor. So let's
just do if player on floor equals false.
That way when it's on the floor again,
we can say okay, they can actually move
again. And then we also need our player
velocity. So I'll do let player velocity
player velocity velocity
equals new 3 do vector 3 just like so.
Okay. Now let's generate our oct tree.
So let's go to our loader and in here we
can just shift alt down arrow to copy
this. We called it ground collider like
so. We can just set our collider oct
tree collider oct tree from graph node
this specific child if the name is
ground collider. So, so we're pretty
much so we're generating our oct tree
based on our ground collider mesh. Now,
we also want to spawn our capsule the
same place that our child is because
right now if we add a capsule to the
scene, it'll just spawn in 0 0. So,
let's do our player collider, which
again is a capsule. We want to target
the start and we want to copy this
child's position. And this will copy the
XYZ position. And then we can add a
vector to it. Will just be the starting
vector itself. We might as well just
copy and paste this like so. So we can
just copy and paste that in there. So if
you think about it, let's say the child
is at 10 10 10. What we're doing is
we're taking we're copying that as the
player collider start and then we're
adding the capsule radius which is.35.
So our capsule is going to start here.
And then we want to do for the end same
thing here except again this will be
capsule height
height and we want this to be end. So
it's going to be at the same position as
this one. The y value is just going to
be higher than this one. Okay. So let's
go now to our gap controls. Um so this
is for
Bulbasaur and all that kind of stuff. So
we don't we can hide that. Uh same thing
here.
Okay. Okay. So, we no longer need um
move character because we can just
update the player velocity and the
target rotation in our on key down
event. And then since now we have to use
the request animation frame loop, we'll
create a separate function that just
updates our player on each frame. So,
let's come over here and do function
update player like so over here. And
then this function will call on every
single frame. So let's just put it in
here like so. Update player like here.
Okay. So since animate function plays on
every single frame and our character is
also loading when the animation frame is
playing. Our player instance might not
actually exist when we do it. So we can
check check if character does not exist.
The instance does not exist. We can just
return it with a guard clause. And this
will prevent any sort of errors.
Alternatively, if you don't want to put
it in the function, you can totally just
come over here and just do like if
whoops character. SL if it exists, you
know, we can update the player. Nothing
particularly wrong with this one either.
Um, but I'm just going to leave it as a
guard clause in uh in here. So, if the
character doesn't exist, just return.
All right. So, let's update our player
velocity. So, these will be player
velocity instead.
Um, so player
velocity
and then we can get rid of this because
we don't need it anymore. And then in
our update player function, we're going
to lurp to the target rotation. So let's
actually bring out this up outside of
this function. And let's just bring it
up with the rest of our player stuff. So
maybe here. Uh then instead of scrolling
back, we can just hit alt back arrow or
left arrow to go back and forth or right
arrow to go back and forth where your
previous cursor positions were. You can
see it's also right here as well. And
then after this switch statement, um we
can just update the player velocity.y.
So we'll do player dot player velocity
the y direction and we equal that to the
jump height. And then we can set
character is moving equal to true. So
character is moving and we can set that
equal to true. Okay. So now in our
update player function we'll check if
the player is not on the floor. So if
the player is not on floor then we will
subtract on each frame from the player
velocity y direction minus equal the
gravity that we set. Gravity that we set
um like so. Now 30 subtracting 30 from
the y direction on each frame is really
really large. So we can multiply by a
factor like 01 or something like that.
Now in the in their example they use
delta time which is good because they
need easing and and they need continuous
movement. We're going abrupt and at
consistent you know consistent movements
every single time. I think crossy road
does have some sort of easing to it but
we're just going to go with something a
little bit more static. And that's why
I'm using constants here rather than
using delta time. So now we can actually
move our player collider. So we'll just
do player collider translate the player
velocity
vector. We'll just clone that. And then
we'll multiply it. Multiply it by a
scaler. And we're just going to keep it
the same as the gravity one as well. So
01 for example. Uh then we need to
character. Then our position can copy
the position of the player collider. So
we'll do character.position.
position.copy.
Whoops.Copy
the player collider
dot start. And then for the
character.position.y
value, we're going to subtract minus
equal the capsule radius capsule radius
because again the start is over here. So
our character would like kind of exist
up here, right? And then we just
subtract this area here. So our legs are
down on the floor instead. And then we
can use linear interpolation a built-in
three math utils function to create our
looping rotation. So we can do
character.rotation.y
equals 3 domath math utils.lurp
and that takes two vectors. So
character.rotation.y
the target rotation that we set and then
0.1. Okay. So let's take a look at what
we have now. So if we go back into the
browser
um cannot read properties of undefined
copy. So if I click on this um
okay whoops yeah it's not
character.position that's the object
itself. So these should be uh instance
so in whoops right click right arrow
once instance like so. Yeah. So at least
we have something now. But you can see
the gravity is working and our character
is falling down there. Okay. So now we
need to actually detect collisions with
our ground. So So we can do that right
here. So let's do player collisions.
Collisions.
And we'll just create this function up
here cuz why not? So we'll do function
function like so over here. And then we
can detect collisions with a built-in
octave method. And we can log the
result. So constant result equals oops
equals collider oct tree capsule
intersect and we'll just pass in our
player collider. So is the oct tree
intersecting with our player collider
and then we can set a by default the
player on floor to equal false and we
can we'll reset this right after if it
is on the false. So if results which
means we have some sort of collision
then check if it's the ground. So if
player on floor equals resultnormal
doy is greater than zero. So how does
this work? Well, we're taking the
resulting collision and checking the
normal y value. If it's greater than
zero, that means we're on the floor and
this will be set to true. So this is an
expression that will be set to true if
you're on the floor. Well, how does that
work? Well, if you're on the if you're a
player here and your capsule is like
this and you're on the floor and you're
colliding with the floor, well, the
normal of the floor in the y direction
is going to be up, which means one,
right? It's going to be in the direction
of one positive y-axis, which is greater
than zero. So, that's going to be true.
And then their next part here is player
collider.
Results donormal
dot multiplycaler
by results. depth. Okay. So, what this
line is doing is it's literally taking
how deep you would go inside your mesh
if it was colliding and just translating
it back outward. So, what update player
does is it's just moving your capsule
around. But player collisions is the one
that's actually detecting collisions.
So, let's say you have a capsule like
this and you have a, you know, box like
this. Update player will just move your
capsule in here. But the thing is we're
calling player collisions. So player
collisions will check okay the result is
indeed that we have a collision. So if
result so we do have a collision and
then since the normal of this thing is
going to be pointing this way we're
going to take this depth multiply it by
the normal of the vector and just
translate the collider back that way. So
every time you press your movement key
against this wall it's just going to
immediately push back to where your
original point started. So essentially
what it's doing is pretty much canceling
your movement command. It's like if you
add five and then someone's like
instantly subtracting five. So that's
kind of what this is doing right here.
Now if the player is on the floor, we
can reset is moving because when it's on
the floor, it's not going to be moving.
Not for us at least. So if player on
floor player on floor, then character is
moving dot is moving equals false. And
then we can set the player velocity of
X. So player velocity X equals zero and
the Z to zero as well. Okay, now we've
go back. Uh, see our character is not
falling through the wall now. So, that's
really good. But if I hit one of my
keys, it's like teleporting somewhere.
So, this kind of suggests that we're
adding a wrong sort of distance to it.
And indeed, we are. Um, move distance. I
think we got rid of. So, it's null. This
should be move speed now. So, now if I
go back, you can see we actually have
the intended behavior that we want.
Except now you can see it's really,
really slow. Uh, and it's kind of like
landing walking on an astronaut or
things like that. Okay, so we can fix
all these issues by making this a little
bit faster. So maybe we can do like 0.3
0.35 or something like this. Uh, you
know, something faster.
Yeah, now it feels a little bit better.
It's a lot faster. Uh, the move distance
is still a little bit too small. So we
can come up to the move distance, um,
sorry, move speed, and maybe add it to
like 10. Uh, so if I go back, you can
see that, oh, we're actually jumping a
lot. And we might, if your colliders are
too short, you can actually jump on top
of them. You can see I just jumped on
top of the bench there, and I can jump
over the wall and fall off the edge,
which is kind of funny. Um, so we can
reduce the amount of jump height as
well, right? So, actually, I want to
tone down the move speed because 10 is a
lot. Um, but we can also change down the
jump height as well. So if that's a
little bit too high to you, you can just
make it like 10 or something. Um, you
know, just play around until you get
something you like. And yeah, so we
pretty much have the same thing that we
have in GAP. Now, um, again, we just
need to normalize the rotations because
again, if I go this way and go this way,
it's going to take the long way around.
Uh, so what we can do is just come back
here and copy our function that we
created earlier uh, to fix this issue.
And then in right before we lurp, so
let's just search for lurp. Right before
we lurp, we can just place this here
like so. And then we can do final
rotation instead of target rotation. So
that'll fix things up just like that.
And if you think the rotation is a
little too smooth when we turn, which it
seems like it is, you can adjust that
with a custom function if you want. Or
you can adjust our linear interpolation
factor and change it up to like 0.4 or
something higher.
And now you can see it'll be a little
bit more abrupt when uh we rotate. Uh,
another really small issue that we have
is as soon as we play the page, you can
see our character goes from this
direction to this direction. And that's
because our player character itself
already starts with a rotation in our
Gil file. So if you want to, you can
like uh child rotation here and like set
the default rotation to be zero so it
doesn't rotate or you can just match our
target rotation to what the character
already has. So math.py divide by two.
Of course, if you want a different
rotation than what's in the JB file as
well as the target rotation, you can
reexport your GB file, or you can just
make them the same. So, you can assign
it on the on completed load function
down there. Set the child rotation to
like math.py, and then also set the
target rot rotation to math.py. Uh, but
here, I'm just setting it equal to what
it was by default. And now you can see
we don't have that spin anymore. Okay.
Now what we need to do is set a respawn
key or in the event that somehow our oct
tree glitches and or we just miss a
collision thing somehow and they can
like jump over something. So the in the
event that happens, let's create a
respawn function. So let's come up here.
Uh let's go into our character and then
uh maybe we put it in here. So spawn
position and it'll just be a new three
dot vector 3
like here and then we can set our
initial one. We could set it here by
logging out the character position but
we can just copy it directly in our load
once we when the model is loaded. So
here if child we can just do character
dotspawn position.copy
the child.position or the character
position in this case and we can put
like a spawn position here. So we can
come over here and just do like function
respawn character respawn
character. Then we can do
character.instance.position.
And we just copy we just copy the spawn
position. Spawn position. Whoops. That
should be character.spawn position. And
of course we also need to update our
colliders. So, what I'm going to do is
just search player collider
start and then uh just grab this here
and then hit alt back arrow and let's
come over here and paste this just like
this. And then we can replace child
position here with spawn position. And
then we can resp
while we're going downwards, it's going
to go forward when we land. Um, so maybe
you want that. Uh, you know, it doesn't
really matter, but I'll just set it back
to zero. So I'll just set it the vector
all back to 0 0 0. And then we can set
character is moving is moving equal to
false.
Uh so let's just make sure this works.
We can first do a key down event. We can
first do a on key down event. Um so this
we could just put it in here like case R
for respawn. Um and that would work, but
this is kind of like associated with the
controls. So we might as well just keep
it separate. And what I'm going to do is
just put it up here. And we'll just do
the same thing. If event key two
lowercase
like so equals equals equals R. Then
let's call respawn character. And let's
just return. We don't have to do
anything in the back. Whoops. Let's see.
Okay, I'm missing a parenthesy here. And
uh I need to get rid of this parenthesy.
Okay, so when I walk, let's hit R and
see what happens. Okay, so we do
respawn. That's pretty cool. Uh, if you
don't like how it like just like
teleports there and has no action
whatsoever, you can add like a vector
here and put it the Y up to like 20 or
something or like make it fall from the
sky. And since we are updating our
gravity on every single frame, it'll
automatically start subtracting from the
Y-value. That way it'll kind of fall
from the top instead of like just stand
there. Um, you can do that if you want.
I'm not going to be doing that. I think
it's totally okay the way it is. But at
least we know respawn position is
working. Yeah. So, what we can do is uh
sorry, I don't know why I'm coming down
here. We could put it in here if we
wanted to, but I'm just actually going
to put in update player. So, I just hit
control and click there to go to the
code. But basically, we can just check,
you know, if the character is fallen.
So, if character instance.positiony,
if it's less than, I don't really know.
I'm just going to say like -20, then
let's just respawn our character. And
then we don't have to execute anything
below. We can just return automatically.
So if you console.log our level, we're
at like 40 in the Y axis or something.
And so anything below like 40 or
whatever our level at mean that our
character is like means our character is
already out of bounds and it's like off
the level. So this will kind of just let
it fall off a little bit into the
darkness which is kind of funny um
before it respawns. And so you'll see a
lot of games like they let you fall for
a little bit amount of time before they
respawn you. Um, so that's exactly what
we're doing here. You know, it doesn't
really matter what value you put this as
long as it's not as long as it's lower
than your scene. Otherwise, you're just
going to keep on perma respawning um
every time you go below Y. Let's say you
have like a down elevation that goes
below -20, it's like going to
automatically respawn your character.
So, just make sure it's well below
everything. So, let's kind of just trace
this stuff. Let's say we have a player
on our screen, right? And then we also
have a capsule like so. And then we hit
a key. And then the player velocity gets
updated with our move speed. So let's
say we're starting at 00 0, which is our
velocity. Then we're adding our move
speed in the Z direction. So let's just
say that would be So let's say we hit W.
So we have 0 0 and then 10 in the Z
direction. And then we also have plus
the jump height, which I think is also
10. So we can do 10 10 0 0 0. So now
each frame it's checking update player.
So, what does update player do? Let's go
to update player. We have some guard
clauses, but we can just ignore that.
So, since our Y value is set at 10, that
means we're not on the floor. So, every
single frame, subtract some amount of
value from the Y. So, let's say we go
through one frame. That means um it's
going to be a lot smaller than what I'm
writing here, but let's just say it's 9
and 10. So, this will be our first frame
for now. And then what we're doing is
we're is we're taking our player
collider. this capsule, we're
translating to our player velocity that
we cloned multiplied by this scaler. So
that means on each frame, we're going to
be going 035
closer towards our player velocity. Then
we're checking for collisions to make
sure that we can actually go towards
that velocity. So we have this built-in
thing. We don't have to write the math
at all. We can just determine if it's
intersecting with anything. And if it is
intersecting with something, if there's
a collision, then we can check if the
player is on the floor. If the collision
is the floor, which I explained a little
bit earlier. And then if the player's on
the floor, it means they're not moving.
So for the one that 3GS did in their
documentation, when they're on the
floor, they can still be moving. For us,
when we're on the floor, we're not
moving at all because we're always up in
the Y when we're moving. That's just the
nature of the way we're controlling. So
that's why we set it to false here. And
we want to prevent any movement when
we're on the floor. So, we just reset it
here and wait for our next jump. And
then here, I also explained this
earlier. It's literally pushing out how
deep your capsule would go. Like, if you
go five deep with this depth value, then
it's just going to push you five units
back outside. Okay. So, since our player
collider now has a good place, we can
just copy it. uh our character instance
position can just copy the player
collider again which is translating
towards our player velocity on every
single frame and we can just copy it and
then again like I said earlier our
character is going to be starting higher
than the capsule because the starting
position is up a little bit 0.35 so we
just subtract it uh you could totally
just do from the end as well and then
make the mathematical adjustment that
way as well but we just did it this way
and then I made this earlier but I might
as well just explain it briefly
Uh if you want, I highly recommend you
console.log every single point and go
and try different target rotations and
kind of like trace what I'm doing here.
But basically what we're doing is we're
taking a target rotation. So let's do
the one that was glitching out uh which
was 180° or math math. And then we were
going to 90 or negative math divided by
pi. Let's just let's just work in
degrees for now. What we're first doing
is taking the rotation value between
these two. So 90 - 180 in this case is
going to be -270
and there will be times where the
rotation might be larger. So we're
modulating by 360°
uh for us just to keep it within the
range of 0 and 360. But this doesn't
really change anything. We still get
-270.
And then what we're doing here is adding
540°. And this will make any angle. So
adding 270 and 540 will just make this
now positive 270. And then again if
there's overkill we're just checking it
one more time to modul by 360.
It's again still 270. Taking 270 minus
180 and then we get 90. So the actual
rotation is 270 but in the end we get 90
which is what we want. And then so here
we have 180. So we have our character
instance rotation which is 180 and then
we just plus 90. So then we go to 270.
So instead of going from 180 back to 90
back to zero back to 90, we just go from
180 to 270. So why are we minusing by
mathpie?
Well, this way it keeps us in the range
between pi and pi.
So if I go for example from 180 to zero,
this is going to be my max amount of
rotation. Anything above 180, like 270,
it's going to take the long way around.
And we don't want the long way around.
So by normalizing it only between
negative pi and pi, we we kind of
prevent it from taking the long way
around and only take the shortest path
possible. And then for this bottom one
here, we're just using the linear
interpolation function that's built in
into 3GS. um starting point, ending
point, linearly interpolate between
those two and then this is just like
determines how jaggedy it is or not or
how smooth it is. So again, I think I
mentioned it earlier, but you can see we
have a starting point and ending point.
You can just think of it interpolating
just like this in Blender. You know, we
don't have all the key frames in
between. We could technically have a key
frame and set it in between for each
one, but we're not doing that. We're
just letting the software figure out
that data in between for us.
So that's essentially what we're doing
here. And again, this is happening on
every single frame. We're calling update
player on every single frame. Uh yeah,
so honestly, congratulations. We did
something very, very, very difficult and
implemented into our own code. What we
did was we analyzed code that we didn't
understand at all. We identified the
parts that we could apply to our own
application, modified certain parts of
it, right? like we got rid of damping
and then we were on the floor we removed
our velocity. So we did a lot of
differences. So we updated existing code
to fit our own stuff. We understood
parts that we didn't understand before
and we broke down a really really
complex thing which is custom movements
into their own parts and added that into
our own application. So, we did a really
advanced concept together and I hope by
walking you through that process, you
kind of develop, you know, how to think,
how to approach problems. And I
encourage you to take some time to take
a look at some of the other things and
see what you can figure out and what you
can play around. It doesn't have to be
this, but any code that you think might
be a little bit too difficult for you.
So again, just break down, uncomment
stuff, comment stuff, change parameters
here and there, break stuff, and kind of
just see what sticks. Eventually, you'll
see these things repeat over and over
again in a variety of different open
source cord repos. The more code you
read, the more methods you'll learn, and
over time, you'll just build up this web
of knowledge and can like tap into it
and make connections between them. Okay,
now we can just get rid of our thing. We
actually don't need these console logs.
Let's get rid of all our console logs.
Um because we don't need those anymore.
We don't need this helper anymore. You
can leave it uncommented if you want,
but I'm just going to get rid of it. Uh
and then for our ground collider, we
don't want to view it anymore. So, we
can remove it from its parent. So, we'll
just do child remove from parent like
so.
Hey, I'm from the future here. I just
want to say I made a mistake here. If
you look up a traverse on 3GS
documentation, modifying the scene graph
inside the callback is discouraged. So
you might be facing a small little error
there. So instead of child remove from
from parent, you can just do
child.visisible and set it to false. I'm
missing a few optimization things there,
but that is a topic for a more advanced
video. And now you can see our
collider's gone, but it's still working
effectively. And then we still have this
helper in. Let's search for our other
helper. Okay. Yeah, we want to get rid
of our shadow help. So now we're back to
what we started. Super super cool. Okay.
So now let's make our camera follow our
character. Um, that way we don't have to
keep moving around. If you want to leave
it moving it around, you might have to
add some user restrictions, but I'm just
going to have it follow our character by
default. So, let's go to our animate
function. And on each frame, we can just
set our camera to look at our player.
So, what we're going to do, I think I
named it camera, our orthographic
camera. So, camera.position.copy
our character.instance. Whoops.
Character.instance.position
like so. And we want to add our camera
offset. So I didn't haven't created this
yet, but we want to add a vector of
camera offset. So this is going to be
our starting position. So I don't
remember where we set our camera. It
doesn't really matter. Let's just jump
to it. So our starting camera position
here is -3967.
So we'll set our const camera offset.
Whoops. Our const camera offset equal to
a new three dot vector 3. Vector 3. So,
we'll set our const camera offset equal
to a new vector 3 like so. And it'll
just be of these values -3, 39, and -67,
like so. And then the last thing we need
to do is actually have our camera look
at it. So, there's a built-in function
called camera.look at where you can just
look at something. And then we're just
going to look at our character position.
And of course, we have an issue here
because again, character instance might
not exist. So we can also just check uh
if character instance or we can put it
in update player but since it's a
separate thing I guess we can just check
for it here anyway. So whatever if I go
back you can see that okay we have
something working but now the camera
every time we go up is also following
the thing. So maybe you want that but I
definitely don't. We can just come over
here and just do const target camera
position position uh equal to a new 3
dot vector 3
dot vector 3 like so. We'll just take
this and add the offset of the X and Y.
Sorry, the X and Z but not the Y.X plus
camera offset
X. And then for camera offset Y, we can
just leave it as camera offset Y. And
then for these, we can put in Z here
like here. This will just be Z. So,
we'll just Whoops. Let's control D. Put
that Z there. And then we can have this
go down here. So, I'm just going to copy
this instead. Like so. And whoops. I
think I got rid of my look at function.
Oh, well, that's fine. We can just do
camera.look at again. We can just do the
X and Z here. So, let's just copy and
paste this. Uh, just put it in here.
Comma. This doesn't need a comma. Uh,
but here. And then for this, we'll just
look at the camera.position. positiony
and then subtract our offset. So we
added 39. So we're just getting rid of
our offset to look at the
camera.position Y value. And we can
adjust this depending on how much of an
angle we want. So now if I go back, you
can see that. Okay, now we have our
camera following the character. Super
super cool. Now let's get rid of our
orbit controls because we no longer need
them. Uh so let's go over here and we
can just uh get rid of them. Just like
that. Uh, and then we can do camera.
Zoom. I don't know, we can set it to
like two or something. And then we need
to call camera.update projection matrix.
So now you can see it's kind of zoomed
in, which is a little bit better. Okay.
So before we deploy to our GitHub and
let the world see something, I just want
to leave you with some final exercises
that you can tackle on your own once the
video is over. And these are also
implemented in my code. So if you're
stuck, you can kind of look at one
method to implement that thing.
Obviously, there's a lot of different
methods to implement a similar thing,
but here at least you have one single
solution that you can reference uh you
know if you need to. So the first
exercise that I'll leave you with is
implementing a theme toggle. So here you
can see I can switch from day to night
mode. Now this might seem scary, but
again try and break it down into what
you know. You can you know how to set a
color of a material. So, how do you set
a color of a light? And then how do I
get the transition? Well, maybe I can
use GSAP to set the transition. So on so
forth. So again, try and break it down
into small steps and see what you can do
from there. The second exercise I have
for you is a loading screen. So how do
we make a loading screen in 3GS? Well,
honestly, I don't even know myself. So I
would go on to Google and type in
loading screen on 3JS and see how other
people have tried to make their loading
screens with 3JS. and they might refer
you to some really really good
documentation that'll tell you how to
implement a loading screen. And then
again, we know how to look at
documentation. We know how to implement
documentation and read parameters and
things like that. The last exercise I
have is more less of 3GS at all,
honestly, but it's more about
implementing mobile controls. So, this
is more of a JavaScript exercise. For
me, my mobile controls is just like
this. It's a simple click like here. You
could definitely use like a swipe
gesture if you wanted to. And then here
you can see I have a very very basic
loading screen. Um it just loads and
then fades out honestly. But beyond
these exercises, there's so many other
areas you can look at. For example, the
trees. They're all the same. So maybe we
could do something with instancing and
optimization if you're kind of down that
route. Maybe you want to make a
different kind of world rather than a
blocky world. Maybe you want to update
some things in your portfolio and then
re-upload it. You know, it's it's really
up to you. uh you know whatever for
future direction that you want to take
it you can totally take it.
All right so create a GitHub account if
you haven't already and create a new
repository. I'm just going to call this
Bellis Park but give it whatever name
you want and then everything is fine
here and we can just create our
repository.
Now we can click this here to upload our
existing files. So I'm going to go into
wherever I saved my stuff. So right
here, my stuff, VS Code, projects,
Bella's Park. And I'm just going to hold
shift to select everything and just
click and drag just like that.
And then you can get a little bit
excited.
Folio.
Um, and then yeah, whatever. And let's
just commit that. Uh, yeah. So I added a
readme, which is why you see this here,
but uh, you can just ignore that. So now
what you want to do is go to versell.com
and create a free account. And then you
can come over here and do add new
project and it should automatically
detect your last repository once you
connect to your GitHub account. So make
sure you connect there. Then you can
just hit import.
And then you can just hit deploy. And
when it says ready, you can just click
this and navigate here. And now you can
see that you've just deployed your
portfolio to the world. Just like that.
Super super cool. That's really awesome.
Yeah. So, thank you so much for sticking
around. Hopefully, this video helped.
Hopefully, you learned a few things. Um,
and right now, like the sky is really
the limit. You can do a lot of things
now. Uh, don't be afraid to try and fail
over and over again. And, um, don't
hesitate to reach out uh, if you have
any questions. Uh, yeah, that's pretty
much it. Take care. Hope to see you in
my next video. Peace out. Bye."

So, 0 to 18, I was here. I was at
school. Basically, before Dubai was even
a thing, I'd tell people back home in
Poland where my family's from, ""Oh, I
live in Dubai."" And people just look at
me like where is that? So now I feel
like you know like a lot of people
obviously will know but back then it was
gosh I can't even tell you how many
people lived here. It really wasn't
many. There was just one road which is
the Shakeside road and the trade center
apartments for anyone that is aware of
Dubai and that's where I used to live.
So yeah it's changed so much. It's grown
massively. It's just been crazy to kind
of I guess be a part of that and see an
emirate change so"

podcast. I'm Quincy Larson, teacher and
founder of Free Code Camp. Today we're
talking with Patrick Hartley, a
self-taught developer who passed up
opportunities to work at big tech
companies so he could stay home and work
remotely with his family. First, I want
to give you some cool community news.
Freamp just published a free 49h hour
data structures and algorithms course.
This massive course will teach you
almost every major data structure and
algorithm that may come up in a
developer job interview. You'll learn
about time complexity, space complexity,
bigo notation. You'll learn about
concepts like trees, graphs, dynamic
programming, backtracking, and more.
Again, this is a 49hour course.
Try to do it without sleeping. I dare
you. Next, Free Code Camp published a
handbook that will teach you React for
beginners. React is a powerful front-end
development library that tons of
companies use to make their websites
more interactive. And if you already
know some basic HTML, CSS, and
JavaScript, this handbook is for you.
You'll learn about JSX components, event
handlers, hooks, and more. Again, this
is a free fulllength handbook on free
code camp. Link in the description.
Check it out after you finish listening
to this podcast. The Swift UI for
beginners course that we just published
will give you the tools you need to
build your first iPhone app. It's a
4hour course and you can code along at
home and build your own movie browsing
app with powerful search features and
the ability to stream movie trailers.
You're going to learn about navigation,
API, network requests, swift data, and
more. Again, this is a free 4hour course
on the free Code Camp YouTube channel
link in the description.
We also published an advanced Python
tutorial on machine learning lineage.
This is an important concept because you
need to establish the safety of
missionritical AI systems. So you're
going to learn about ETL pipelines, data
drift checks, model tuning, model risk
assessment. This is a probably about 30
minute read. If you take your time, if
you already have some Python basics,
give it a go.
Then I wanted to share this awesome game
that I found, Message Delivery Browser
Game. You just walk around, you're
delivering messages to people. It's
really chill. There's like this nice
little fishing village and you can just
explore and it's really cool because
it's a 3D game that runs in your browser
and you can play it on your phone. You
can just like move your thumb around and
stuff. Check it out. It's It's worth 15
minutes or so just to relax and enjoy
this nice provincial career. [laughter]
The song of the week, Moa Shop is a
French house uh producer, very anime
inspired, and he takes his new album and
glitches the everliving heck out of it.
If you like dance music, I think you're
going to love this. So, this is a pretty
long glitched out. It's like 18 minutes,
but it's like several songs kind of in a
big live set. I think you're going to
love it. This free co shirt I'm wearing,
you can get your own. It is only 20
bucks shipped anywhere in the US. It's a
nice trib blend shirt. I've washed mine
like a hundred times. Several hundred
times probably. It still looks fine. And
these are personally screen printed by
Raphael Hernandez who hosts the Spanish
Free Coamp podcast. And he also runs his
own screen printing business in
Virginia. Go to shop.freccoamp.org.
Pick yours up today. Uh, if you're
outside the US in Unity, by the way, uh,
just go to our assets library and you
can make your own for personal use.
Sorry, I don't want to ship outside the
US anymore. It's a nightmare. People
never get their packages. It cost a
fortune. Uh, eventually we may ship
outside the US, but uh, for now, just
um, yeah, just feel free to use our
assets on your shirt for private
non-commercial use if you want to make
your own shirts. Okay, so today's
interview, Patrick Hartley. This dude is
super chill. He's a self-taught
developer with nearly a decade of
software engineering experience. When he
was 21, he had to drop out of college to
provide for his family. He had a kid and
uh he taught himself programming while
working at the thrift shop making ends
meet. After building his own apps and
freelancing, he became the founding
engineer at a startup which got acquired
and he has since worked as a developer
at other tech companies. A few months
ago, he turned down the opportunity to
work at Amazon so he could continue to
work remotely from his home in Oklahoma
City. He did not want to go back to
office. He has a son who has uh special
needs and he needed to be there for him
and to take care of his family. And I
totally respect that. This guy is from
Oklahoma City where I'm from. Uh and
it's it's really cool to see him
succeed. So, let's share he's going to
share some tips for teaching yourself
programming while raising kids. I think
many of us listening can probably uh
resonate with that. Uh kids take a lot
of time uh how to build foundational
skills with JavaScript and Python and
then branch out from there. He learns a
lot of like C.NET and stuff because
that's just what the local employers in
his relatively small tech market are
wanting developers to know and you can
just pivot your skills and learn those.
And he'll talk a lot about that. Uh tips
for getting a remote job when you have
to compete with the global developer
talent pool. You're not just competing
with the best developer in Oklahoma
City. You're competing with the best
developer in India, in China, in Canada,
everywhere, right? Um and then how to
survive as an introvert in a networking
heavy and meetingfilled profession
because there are a lot of meetings in
developers uh as a developer and
Patrick's going to talk a lot about
that. I think you're going to dig this.
Patrick Hartley, welcome to the free
code camp podcast.
>> Yeah, thanks for having me.
>> Yeah, man. It's exciting to talk with
you. you're somebody who has been
around, has seen things, and I think
you're going to be able to share a lot
of insight with the fine folks tuned in
to the podcast.
>> Yeah, I definitely hope so. I hope I can
provide some sort of help.
>> Yeah. Well, uh, you've been a dev for
like a decade, and you really prioritize
being able to work remotely, being able
to continue to live in Oklahoma City
where you've lived for a long time. Uh,
you were recently on the job market.
What's it like competing with the global
talent pool for remote jobs?
>> So, uh, yeah, I started looking probably
I would say it took me about a couple
months to find a job. So, I started
looking probably close to about a year
ago. And, um, yeah, leaving within
Oklahoma, you know, I I like to think
I'm I'm, you know, pretty valuable. But,
you know, the moment you step out of
those borders, it becomes very obvious
that you're competing with a whole host
of people with varying talents. uh
talents and varying levels of experience
and it can become very overwhelming and
a little bit, you know, discouraging
sometimes. Like I said, I I searched
for, you know, about four to five months
before I finally found something that,
you know, sort of agreed with me. But,
um, yeah, especially about the time that
I was looking was around [clears throat]
the time that there was a lot of tech
layoffs. And so, um, I wasn't just
competing, you know, with people here in
Oklahoma anymore. you know, once you go
into a remote, you know, position, now
you're competing against, you know,
people that were laid off from
Microsoft, people that have been doing
this for a lot longer than I have and
people um yeah, that are a lot more
experienced in some ways. And uh like I
said, it can be a bit discouraging
sometimes, but you know, I I stuck with
it and it ended up working out. I found
a place that I really love and that
really values me and that I I I felt
like it was a really good fit. And so,
in that sense, um you know, it was one
of those things you you you wait long
enough and hopefully something right
will happen. Well, luckily that worked
out for me. So,
>> yeah. And how
early on did you decide, no, I'm not
going to go take like the the jobs in,
you know, various big cities in Texas,
uh, for example, like a lot of jobs here
in Dallas, a lot of jobs in Austin, and
then, of course, you got your California
jobs, your Washington state jobs up in
Seattle, a lot of big tech companies up
there. Like, how early in the process
did you just kind of make that decision?
because uh my understanding is you did
apply to like Amazon uh and and got
pretty far before you decided that that
wasn't the right place for you.
>> Yeah. So I I was kind of interested in
in relocating at first. Um so yeah, I
did apply to Amazon. I got through uh a
number of the screenings and was invited
out to Austin actually for a on on the
site interview. Um after thinking about
it and talking about it with my wife, I
decided it was probably a better
decision to stay local or you know stay
where we're at. Um, one of the reasons
contributing to that, I should say, is
that my son has autism and we homeschool
him and um, he just requires a certain
amount of care that my wife provides and
so she stays home and so we are uh, uh,
whenever we need caretaking, my mother
provides that. So, we have a really
strong family structure here in Oklahoma
City and leaving that just seemed like a
very daunting task. It seemed like a a
big hurdle to jump over and so when I
was invited out to Austin by Amazon, I
was I was obviously very flattered. I
was and part of me really wanted to go
just to sort of experience you know the
Fang interview experience. Um but uh you
know after thinking about it after
talking about with my wife I decided it
was kind of a waste of my time. It was
kind of a waste of their time. I didn't
you know I didn't I didn't want to waste
their time as much as I didn't want to
uh waste mine. And so I decided to I
decided against it. Like I said we just
had so much kind of structure here in
the city that it was it became too much
to leave.
>> Yeah. And for everybody tuning in that
doesn't know my personal background I
didn't grow up in Oklahoma City. Uh, so
now I'm located about four hours south
in Dallas, but uh, like Oklahoma City
does have a developer community. Tech is
doing really cool work out there. Uh,
lot of, uh, tech companies getting
created over there, but like
realistically it's not, you know, like a
major tech hub.
>> Yeah. There are developer jobs there.
Yeah.
>> Yeah. It's a I would say it's a small
community, too. Like we we all know of
each other. You know, it's like I said,
I I could probably find a job here
within Oklahoma, but um after after some
of the jobs that I had, uh to be quite
blunt about it, like salary became a
thing to where it's like within Oklahoma
salary the the job market hits a certain
amount and in order to get above that,
you're kind of forced to sort of look
outside of Oklahoma City after a certain
point.
>> Yeah. So, let's talk about like your
background and I want to dive into how
you were able to go from, you know,
somebody who dropped out of college and
had limited skills to somebody who was
working at these tech companies in your
area. Um, and maybe you can walk through
kind of like your your personal journey
up to that decision to drop out of
college, like maybe starting with your
interest in computers in general. And my
understanding is you did study computer
science as an undergrad. That was the
major you chose.
>> Yep. Yeah. So I think I started off um
in college under um entertainment
business. I like the idea of of being
around the entertainment industry, music
and movies and stuff like that. Um but
then um I I'd always been interested in
tech. I I was the kid that would tear
apart radios and try to put them back
together and um just to see how things
would work and tinker with stuff like
that. Um, when we first got our first
home computer, this was way back,
probably just America Online, if that
says anything to anybody. Um, so
whenever we got our first home computer,
I was absolutely obsessed with it. I I
was on it all the time. I thought it was
really awesome. Um
and uh so yeah, so when I went to
college, I quickly realized that I
really loved this tech stuff and um the
maybe the business side of things just
didn't, you know, shine me like it
originally did and I decided to switch
tracks and go into um computer science.
I was there for about a uh two years and
um unfortunately um I was I was with my
girlfriend at the time. Um she got
pregnant and um you know, like what
happens, life happens is what how I put
it. And um after that I had to end up
working full-time to support the family.
Um so I did that for a little bit. Uh me
and her broke up. I I uh you know
obviously still have the child. She
lives in South Carolina with her mother.
I love her to death. Um I got with my
wife uh my current wife now. And uh once
she became pregnant with my son um there
was a big onus on us of or I shouldn't
even say of us. It was really on me. I
really wanted to do something that could
provide for my family a little bit
better than what I was doing at the
time. I I had sort of, you know, um a
collage of jobs. Um one of them I was
working at a thrift store cleaning all
the stuff in the back before it was put
out onto the floor. So I was cleaning
old shoes and uh you know, baby baby f
baby equipment, stuff like that. U and
you know, working there was just like I
I want to be doing something different.
I want to be I want to provide
essentially was I wanted to provide a
better life for my family. And knowing
that I had those tech skills sorted in
my back pocket that hadn't really been
developed a whole lot. And um it was a
huge interest of mine, I decided that I
really wanted to give it a go. And my
wife who was pregnant at the time said,
""Well, if you're going to do it, do it.""
Because she had known that I I tried a
few times, but I really didn't commit as
much as I probably could have. Um like I
said, life sort of happens. But we got
to a place to where it was a little bit
more stable. And so after work every
day, I would come home. Um I would lock
myself in my bedroom and for 3 to four
hours, I would just learn. I would learn
on free code camp. I would learn on any
sort of free um tool that would help me
um hone my skills. Um I primarily
started in um when I went to college
there was a big emphasis on Java. Um
once I got once I started getting more
interest in tech I realized that the the
market at least in Oklahoma City for
Java was pretty limited. So um whenever
I started learning I learn started
learning primarily with JavaScript. Um,
from there I learned um, front-end
frameworks and from there uh, after
about six months of teaching myself um,
I was working with a mentor at the time
and he told me that I was probably ready
to start looking for jobs. I didn't feel
that way but I I I trusted him and I
started looking for jobs and about six
months after training myself uh, I was
finally able to land a job working as a
front-end engineer for a for a fairly
small company but um, it worked out
really great.
>> Yeah, maybe you can talk about that
mentorship relationship. That's
interesting. Yeah, I I we weren't
extremely close, but it was definitely
some it was enough that it kept me going
and it was enough to where I could ask
him questions whenever I got stuck about
learning resources about the job market,
you know, uh whatever you're learning. I
think there's there's sort of a
confusion because the the way I learn is
very different than the way that I
worked or or that I work currently. Um
and so I would ask questions like, you
know, whenever I get a job, am I going
to be coding 100% of the time? am I, you
know, how much of this, how what
percentage of this is going to be
meetings, what percentage of this is
going to be going over documentation,
what percentage of this is going, so um
trying to feel out what the what what an
actual employment situation looked like.
Um, he was really great in that. And
then he was also really great, like I
said, kind of determining, you know,
when I was job ready. I I think uh
imposttor syndrome is huge in the dev
community, especially among people who
are self-taught. And it can be really
hard to identify when you're ready
because I think nobody really feels
ready. Um, you know, I know I didn't.
And showing him my work, showing him
some of the things that I was playing
around with, some of the some of the
simple things that I had built using uh
the front-end skills that I had
harnessed. Um, you know, after looking
at that, he said, ""Yeah, I think you're
definitely ready. In fact, you you were
probably ready a month ago. Uh, why
don't you start looking and go and just
seeing what happens?"" And I did that and
I was very very blessed in the fact that
I think I got
>> three interviews and I was offered two
of those jobs. So I I was very very
lucky. Um I I really attribute a lot of
that to uh my soft skills to be honest.
Um
>> I feel like
just you weren't like just going on some
web app you know application form and
filling out applications like were you
using a network? How were you getting
out there to find those opportunities
like
>> Yeah. Well, I was using the network uh
through my mentor. So, um I I was part
of Tech Oklahoma. And so, because of
that, there was a lot of businesses that
knew of, you know, knew of that
organization and knew of the people
coming out of that organization, knew
how committed they were. You know, I was
going to meetings at least once a week.
That was another part of me being a
little bit more dedicated than I had
been in the past was um trying to be a
part of the community, trying I'm very
much an introvert, so it was very
against my nature. Um but you know I
went to those meetings. I tried to talk
to people. I tried to make friends and
acquaintances and um through that I I
met some recruiters that also helped me
as well. Um and they were extremely
valuable especially as a first-time
person. It can be hard to get your foot
in the door. Recruiters can kind of be a
help uh for that. Um so yeah I had a
number of people that kind of helped me
along my way and you know obviously very
grateful for all of them.
>> Yeah. So uh just to recap some of your
insights. First of all, having a that
mentor sounds like worth his weight in
gold. Just having somebody there that's
been there that can give you context so
it doesn't seem like such an abstract
thing. What is it like to work in a
developer role?
>> Exactly. And not being in that industry
and I didn't have a lot of friends in
that industry before, you know, I
started going to those meetings and so I
was just I was on an island at first as
far as you know, I don't know where I'm
at compared to other people. And having
a mentor really helped sort of um frame
frame the picture for me as far as you
know how I was doing, where I needed to
go, what markets were were most rich
within the area. Um you know, which
languages and frameworks were valuable
for, you know, trying to get a job here
in the city. Um everything like that he
was extremely valuable in helping me
with.
>> Yeah. So that mentor, finding that
mentor, uh, but like the big profound
thing I took away from that is the value
in going to local developer events,
finding them through meetup.com or
there's like this app Luma that like a
lot of people are using now when I go to
San Francisco. All the tech events are
on Luma uh lu ma. Uh, and then uh just
word gets around about these events,
especially if they're like long
recurring events. A lot of universities
will have like a computer science club
or something. Even if you're not a
student, you may be able to participate
in those. Yeah. And just get to know
people and then you're not a resume in
the inbox. You're a known quantity. Oh,
I've talked to this person before. I saw
him at this, you know, tech conference a
while back or something like that,
right? Uh because uh that's that's
something that like both Danny uh
Thompson and Leon Noel, whom I recently
interviewed, talk about like you
shouldn't be applying through web apps
through through uh application forms.
you you should be meeting people and
shaking their hand and uh leaving some
sort of impression that people can walk
away with. Um yeah, so the other thing
that I took away from that is just your
mentor said you were probably ready like
a month ago. Like six months is really
fast to get a first developer job. But
uh one question I have is like so you
were studying CS and I know you were
like learning Java and probably doing a
lot of general education requirements
and stuff that people do the first two
years of school. So I don't know how
much programming you even got to during
your uh two year your short stint at uh
university but like how useful has that
knowledge been on the job?
>> Uh I would say the B it provides a
foundation I would say like I said um I
I was mostly learning Java which uh I'll
be honest I have not used since. Um but
it provided the way of thinking I think
that that uh really became more valuable
as I became a developer. Like I said,
later on I'd always been interested in
it and I dabbled in it a few times um
since dropping out of college, but when
I finally got back into it, things
started clicking. So, it's sort of like
riding a bike, I would imagine. Um you
know, you you train yourself to think in
a certain way and then even though
you've stopped for a while, the moment
you sort of pick get back on the bike
and start riding again, it's like, ""Oh,
I remember this. I remember how this
works."" Um so, I do think it was
valuable. um the individual like
language that I was using and stuff like
that, but that's all sort of tertiary I
think in terms of um the real value that
it provided. Um as far as staying there
for four years, how that would have
turned out, I don't know. You know, I've
I've I've worked with a lot of people
who did four years uh and I've actually
worked with managers who told me that
sometimes we prefer self-taught people
because there's a lot of people that
come out of college after four years,
but they just don't know how to build
anything. uh you know they learn a lot
of theory, they learn a lot of um you
know terms, they learn encapsulation,
they you know they they learn all these
terms but they don't really know how to
put it to use and being selftaught it
was one of those things to where the
only thing that my resume you know had
to show was actual projects that I had
worked on actual things that I had built
uh because obviously I didn't have that
sort of formal education to fall back
on. So um I think it was valuable um
yeah I think it was valuable in its own
right.
>> Yeah. Yeah. And let's talk about some of
those early projects that you built when
you were learning uh programming on your
own, working at the thrift shop, uh
busting out the laptop and and and using
free co- camp and other open uh learning
resources. What uh were what were some
of the projects you built to to kind of
get your seal, so to speak, and to also
have something you can show to
prospective employers that proves that
you know what you're doing?
>> Yeah. So, uh I did things that were just
of interest to me to be honest. Um, I
did a I think I did a Twitch status. Um,
this was back when Twitch was in its
infancy really, but I did a Twitch
status um, sort of updater to where it
you would provide the the names of all
your favorite Twitch people and it would
let you know whether they were online or
not at the time and how long they had
been streaming for. I did another
project that was uh there was a series
of commercials back then called Sales
Badger to where it had a puppet badger
that would try to sell cars and those
commercials for some reason just were
hilarious to me. So, I created a
soundboard of all the funny things that
this little puppet would say, and me and
my friends at at uh the job that I was
working at at the time would just die
laughing. We thought it was hilarious.
And so, that was something that I took
into my first interview that was sort of
appreciated. And uh, you know, the real
value behind those was using different
libraries, using different frameworks,
and showing what I wanted to show was a
was a width of experience. Uh, just just
a wide range of things that I've had
been involved in. And so I think for the
sales badger soundboard, there was some
sound sound clipping libraries that I
used there. Um, for the Twitch streaming
status, there was API calls that that
were done there. So I just wanted to
whenever I finally got in front of a a
prospective employer, I just wanted to
be able to show I've worked with a
number of things, you know, anything
that you can throw at me, I I can pick
up and I can work on. Um, so it was very
important to me to show sort of just a
wide range of things that I could work
on.
>> Awesome. So show employers your width of
experience. I like that. And then uh as
you're going out and getting these jobs
like like maybe you can walk through
what the interview process was like back
then this was uh around like 2018 or so
20 I don't know it's been like 10 years
so like 2016 or so and then um and then
maybe you can compare and contrast that
with what the developer interview
process is like now that it's become
more competitive with more senior talent
kind of like looking for jobs and stuff.
Yeah. So, when I first started out, um,
it was a little bit different in that I
feel like there was a there was a number
of soft skills that really got me in the
door and honestly landed me the job. I
actually, one of those three interviews
I uh I I had talked about previously, my
first set of interviews, um, one of them
told me straight up that I was not the
most technical person that they had
interviewed and that uh, I was probably
not the most knowledgeable person, but
they wanted, excuse me, but they wanted
to hire me because of my soft skills.
They said, ""I think we can communicate
with you a lot better than some of the
other people that I applied. I think uh
I think you're willing to learn. I think
you're hungry."" Um all those things I
thought described me pretty well. And so
there was a number of soft skills that I
could use to sort of wedge my way in.
And and then um you know, then I could,
you know, show through my technical
chops that like, yeah, I may not be the
most technical now, but I I'm a very
fast learner and I can pick up things
very quickly. Um that happened on my
second interview and on my third
interview. All my interviews have gone
or I'm sorry the the interviews that led
to my other jobs um all those interviews
were very much um very highlighted a lot
of my soft skills that I was very proud
of. Nowadays um at least in in the most
recent example of me looking for a job
there's a high interest on a lot of
technical stuff and um it becomes very
difficult because um you know my entire
career has been built around Angular and
net but I am not the most technical
proficient angular person. I'm not the
most technical technically
proficient.NET person. Um, so sometimes
unfortunately some of these companies
are looking for the most technical
person they can find. Um, and sometimes
those soft skills they're not that
worried about. They just want to find
the most technical person with the most
technical experience. And unfortunately
sometimes you get sort of pigeon holed
into some of these things. That's like
uh I I do know React. I love React but
it's very difficult. It was very
difficult for me to get a react uh you
know interview because of my vast
experience in Angular and I didn't have
a lot of professional experience in
React. So um I I feel like a lot of
times nowadays the some of these I
should say some some of these companies
are are really just looking for the most
technical person they can find with the
most experience and with the most
experience in the very specific stack
that they're looking in. And
unfortunately, I feel like some of these
companies are really missing out on
candidates that, like I said, can bring
a a wide range of experience. And
sometimes, I think showing that wide
range of experience shows you I can work
on anything. You know, whether you
change stacks later on in the future or
you decide, hey, we need to bring in
this library to to facilitate some sort
of feature or Epic that we're building.
Um, I feel like some of these companies
are really missing out on candidates
that have a uh a more varied set of
skills than sometimes being extremely u
proficient in a very niche um small
amount of uh tech.
>> I mean that may have something to do
with just like the nature of having
usually non-developers doing the you
know triage process in terms of figuring
out which candidates to interview. So
they're they have 10 years of experience
doing this specific thing that my uh you
know software is telling me is important
right now or my manager is telling me go
hire somebody who has a lot of react
experience. They're managing me as
simple as that. And they
>> I can't tell you how many interviews I
had to where it was like yeah I don't
know what this is but I was told that
you're supposed to have five years
experience of this. You know I don't
know what this is but do you have
experience in this? And yeah those
interviews can they they they wear on
you a little bit. So like having a
relatively frustrating experience, we we
can, you know, yesterday's tragedy is
tomorrow's comedy. You know, you
probably went through fairly grueling uh
battery of interviews and dealing with
frustration like I've got I'm Yeah.
>> What do you want from me? Right.
>> Exactly. Like and I I think a lot of
people like you you'll see this on
social media and stuff. people just
burned out on the process of trying to
talk with these people or worse with
these AI systems [laughter]
that don't understand these things. Uh
but I I think most developers that are
actually hiring managers, if you can get
in front of an actual developer for a
technical interview, they're going to
understand like, oh well, Angular is not
that different from React, right? It's
still a front-end, you know, development
framework. uh and that like a lot of the
skills can be applied, but
you do have to do a lot of explaining
and and like sometimes the person that
you're talking to maybe maybe you can
talk through the process of interviewing
at several of the companies that that
you interviewed with on this more recent
uh go through because you just got that
job a few months ago. So you are in a
great position to empathize with the
plight of the relatively experienced
developer who's out there right now
trying to get developer jobs especially
remote developer jobs which are much
harder to get but uh much better right
>> Yep.
>> Yeah. So, I I would just say that, you
know, just stick with it. And um you
know, the the good thing about me is is
um the the type of job that I landed at
and really all the jobs that I've landed
at have been really a really good fit
for me personally because like I said,
like uh I'm very much a developer. I'm
very much a technical person, but I do
have soft skills that I'm very proud of
and that I think really, you know, sort
of um complement a lot of my tech skills
as well. Um, I think that's why, you
know, some of the projects that I've
been involved in has been as as
successful as they are, is that I'm able
to wear a number of hats. You know, I'm
not just a developer. You know, uh, some
of the projects that I've been involved
in, I've also been a, um, a designer.
I've been a product manager. Um, I've
been backend, front end, I've been all
over the place. Um, you know, a lot of
the stuff that I that I've worked on in
the past on some of our projects has not
been technical at all. Um, and so, uh,
when I finally find, you know, a an
employer that sort of values that, it's
just the perfect fit. And so I would say
if people are having a hard time finding
that fit, eventually you'll find someone
that values the the you know the the
skills that you bring, whether they be
technical, whether they be, you know, a
little bit more on the soft side,
whether it be a mixture of the two. Um
you know, I I will say that every job
that I've had, I've been very blessed
and I I have felt like it was a good fit
for me personally. So um you know, not
everybody's going to be in my situation.
Some people are going to be very very
technical on certain aspects and um I'm
sure they're gonna find their fit, too.
It's it's just a matter of, you know,
finding somebody who values you for what
you bring to the table. That was one of
the very most important things for me
because uh I had a lot of interviews
like I I don't need anybody patting me
on the head or, you know, kissing my
butt or anything like that, but it did
seem like there was a lot of these
companies that like you said were just
trying to find the most experienced
person in these three things. It didn't
matter what else was going on with this
person or what was going on
professionally. Um but there were a
couple companies that were like it
seemed like they definitely valued what
I brought to the table and um those were
the those were the most fun interviews
as well is because it began a a real
good conversation over you know you know
how much how much uh you know how much
of the job is tech skills, how much of
it is being able to talk to product
managers and and UXUI people and um even
even customers directly sometimes. Um,
and so having those conversations were a
lot more entertaining to me. And and
those companies really spoke to me a lot
more at the end of the day anyway. So I
would just say, you know, it's going to
fit where it's going to fit. And if you
haven't found your fit yet, there's a
company out there that's looking for you
probably. And and you just got to be
patient and just I I know it's hard. I
looked for months and months and months.
I looked for almost a half a year. Um,
and I was blessed in the fact that I was
looking while I already had a job. I
know that there are people who are
unemployed who are looking and who are
uh, you know, very very despared about
that. But I would just say just keep at
it and you're going to find a good fit
for you.
>> Yeah. Awesome. One of the things I want
to dive deeper into uh is your special
specialization around a specific stack.
So, of course, there are lots of Java
developers out there. There are lots of
like full stack devs that just use Node
on the back end uh or that use like you
know Python libraries like Flask or
Django as their back end. Kind of like
what I call like the open source like
most conventional stack. Uh and then
there are more proprietary stacks if you
will uh such as the Microsoft.NET
ecosystem which is an entire tool
ecosystem that uh has its own libraries
for everything and uh very powerful uh
and free code camp of course has lots of
car.net
courses on the free co YouTube channel.
We've also worked with Microsoft to
create the uh C foundational
certification which is uh free and
anybody can get it on free coamp and
it's it's a joint certification between
free co-amp and Microsoft. Uh are people
sleeping on net like do you think that
it's something that more people should
consider exploring as devs?
>> I think it really depends on where how
you want to move forward. Um I've
noticed that a lot of the the um
startups and and some of the smaller
companies that I had started um
interviewing with um none of them really
use .NET. Um they were using a lot of
node like you had talked about there was
a lot of Python. I think the overhead on
those are are a lot smaller. Um even I
mean even if you just start up a a C orn
net project um there's a lot of
boilerplate that goes into it. There's I
mean it's a huge project before you even
type your first code. So I think there
can be a lot of overhead and it can be
sort of daunting to start on something
like that. Um but for me personally um
within the Oklahoma City market at least
I can speak towards um almost everything
was net almost everything was net and
angular everybody was just really bought
into the Microsoft ecosystem and um for
me that was really the only way moving
forward um I loved my time with net I I
love it now. Um, but when you're when
you're trying to do something quick and
fast or quick and dirty, it can be a lot
of overhead to get started on. Um, I
know that recently I've I've started a
new project to where I I tried to use a
net back in. Um, I was I was sort of see
trying to see how far I could get vibe
coding just with using AI alone. And I
think the the number of files, I think
the context, I think there's just a lot
going on with .NET to where it made it
very difficult. I restarted that same
project with a JavaScript backend and
boom, man, that just flew. It just flew
off the handles how fast it was. And so,
um, .NET is a it's a mixed beast. It's
really great, I think, once you get into
corporate environments and and you
really need strong typing, you need a
lot of infrastructure. Um, when you It's
really good, I think, when you have a
lot of cooks in the kitchen, so to
speak. Um, there's a lot of ways that uh
it sort of protects you against messing
up when you have a lot of people working
on the same codebase. But if you're
needing something quick and dirty, um,
yeah, Python and JavaScript are really,
really great go-tos.
>> Yeah. And one thing I'll say about AI
assisted coding. I don't like to use the
term vibe coding because, yeah, I think
a lot of it is actually not vibe coding
in the way that uh, Andre Karpathy
originally, you know, coined the term or
you just let the computer do everything.
You can do that. That's not advisable.
Uh,
>> yeah, I would either.
>> Yeah. AI assisted coding which free code
camp has a book that we published
recently by Mesh Moapatra on our team
that that'll walk you through like the
entire tool ecosystem and emerging best
practices and stuff like that. Uh but uh
the
large language models uh you know cloud
code and all this stuff they are trained
on open source code and there's a lot
more open source code written in
JavaScript and Python than there is
written in C#. A lot of the biggest C#
uh code bases are probably closed
source, right? So it doesn't have the
same corpus of uh examples to draw upon
uh as it does with JavaScript. I mean
like
>> I I think JavaScript
>> just by virtue of being by far the most
ubiquitous programming language. Uh
certainly represented in open source
it's going to it's it's got this huge
first mover advantage or you know this
huge advantage in terms of like because
LLMs are going to be so good at
generating JavaScript. It's it's going
to become more and more of the big open
source ecosystem especially for small
projects that are just getting started
out. And I can definitely understand if
you're like a bank or uh you know uh an
educational uh backend tool like what
you're working at with now that's like
>> you know uh has tons of uh security
requirements that the governments are
probably requiring if you're working
with like the the data of miners or if
you're working with health records or
something like that like what C C andnet
offer is a whole lot of things to
prevent you from screwing up
catastrophically.
That's a great way to put it. Yeah,
that's exactly how I would put it.
>> And and like you said, working with huge
uh teams, uh it makes a lot of sense to
use like a big framework that is uh
maintained uh with like service level
agreements and things like that. Yeah.
So uh but it sounds like if I were to
kind of like summarize your advice is
like no problem like just learning a lot
of C uh a lot of uh Python and
JavaScript and then depending on what is
big in your local job market it may make
sense to tool up
>> I yeah so uh I should have said that
yeah whenever I was uh learning backend
stuff I actually started with node um
because I was working in JavaScript and
that was the first language that I um
was learning so I the first project that
I did a backend on was node um and then
once I got the job. Um I got a job and
they told me that the stack was going to
be Angular and C uh.NET and I had not
done anything at all innet and uh
Angular at that point. But for those two
weeks before I you know left my the job
that I was at before starting the next
job uh for two weeks that's all I did
that's all I did was just angular
classes.NET classes and so I came onto
the job sort of at least halfway knowing
what I had done and they were extremely
pleased and surprised. So, a lot of
getting the job and and and doing well
on the job also is just is just that
initiative that just that grit of of
wanting to prove yourself, being a
little bit hungry, you know. Um, so
yeah, that that paid off in spades later
on.
>> Awesome. And that's my next question for
you is I want to dive deeper into what
it's like at a new job that you just
got. Now, you've had this experience as
a new developer. Now, you're having that
this experience as a more senior
developer. Uh maybe you can compare and
contrast, but like everybody talks about
how do you get a job, but nobody talks
about how do you succeed in those
critical first few weeks at a developer
job? Can you walk us through maybe your
first developer job, what you did, what
you learned from those first few weeks
in terms of like asking questions of
your peers and and figuring out the lay
of the land, figuring out how to
navigate the legacy codebase.
>> Yeah. So, uh, my first job was at a, um,
a media
trying to talk about how to describe it.
Um, whenever you go into a bank and you
see like the commercials on the TV of,
you know, advertising, you know, our our
car loan numbers and stuff like that,
well, all that gets beamed up to the TV
through some sort of controller and all
that content is managed somehow. And so,
uh, I worked for a company that provided
that, provided a way to through an
online portal provide content that would
be beamed onto these TVs. It was
essentially a way to advertise during
weight times. Um and so whenever I
started there um the big question was
like what am I going to be doing all
day? Am I going to be coding 100% of my
time? And for that job actually um the
answer was almost almost really um
whenever I came on uh into my first day
on the job the very first thing they
said is we're using Angular, we're
using.net here. uh they had a
Pluralsight uh membership that they
provided through the company and they
said um you know here's your Pluralsight
login get to learning and luckily like I
said I had spent two weeks trying to
brush up on that so it was pretty quick
um quick pretty quick ramp up for me
personally um but uh yeah so that first
job it was a lot of coding and it was um
basically sitting in a room with two
other coders and uh we didn't talk to
each other very very often but it was
just 100% coding just getting getting
down and dirty with the code. Um, now I
will say obviously being new there was a
lot of questions about where things were
located. You know, what does this file
do? What does this config file do? Where
does this map up? And um, questions like
that I think I asked out the gate pretty
quickly. Um, there were other questions
that I tried to I mean part of being a
dev is really reading documentation,
finding out answers for yourself. Um, I,
you know, I used to joke that, you know,
being a dev is just being an expert
Googler. like knowing exactly what to
Google and when and how to find the
answers for what you're trying to do is
so much of part of the job that um I
feel like junior devs really need to
experience that is that um you know well
I don't know how to do this if I were a
senior dev I'd say well have you looked
at my very first question would be have
you looked it up yet have you looked at
the documentation have you searched it
how long have you spent trying to find
the answer on yourself uh or find the
answer for yourself and then um you know
my rule of thumb and the rule of thumb
that I kind of stand by today is after
an hour of searching and and
experimenting and trying
if you still haven't gotten it, that's
when I usually reach out to somebody who
I think might be a little bit more
knowledgeable about me, about the
situation than I am. Um, because
obviously, you know, you don't want to
be bothering the seniors about every
little thing that comes up, especially
when most of those things you could
probably take care of yourself through a
through a Google search or through
documentation. Um, but at the same time,
you don't want to be drowning, you know,
quietly drowning in the corner because
you don't know what you're supposed to
be doing. So, um, it, you know, and like
I said, me being an introvert, it was
kind of hard for me. And I think it's
hard for everybody to admit, hey, I
don't know how to do this. I I've
realized you just hired me to be a
developer. I don't know how to do this.
I need help doing this. Uh, getting over
that bubble and understanding that them
hiring you as a junior dev, they
understand you're not going to know
everything. They expect you to not know
everything. And in fact, I would say it
would behoove you to ask more questions
than you think you probably should
because they know you don't know these
things and they expect you to ask
questions. At least that's that's been
my experience. Yeah. Yeah. So, it sounds
like being able to figure out how to
strike the balance of when to ask
questions. You said uh your general rule
of thumb is like work on it for an hour
and if you're stuck after an hour, go
ahead and seek outside help to get
unstuck.
>> And uh that is important because you
don't want to come across as completely
incompetent. But at the same time, you
have to have the humility to not just
try to fake it. You know, I'm doing fine
over here. No problem over here. Right?
like that's not going to that's not
going to get you where you want to go.
You do need to ultimately be able to
ship things and sometimes that involves
kind of like swallowing your pride so to
speak and and just um uh asking for
help. Uh and now maybe you can contrast
that with like you know like that first
job it sounds like you had the dream of
not having a whole lot of meetings. A
lot of developers complain about
meetings. I think that meetings are
important to uh save time and make sure
everybody's online and like figured out
what to do. Uh there there there's this
uh quote that I love. Uh weeks of coding
can save you hours of meetings.
[laughter]
>> Yeah, exactly.
>> This said uh meetings uh you don't want
to go overboard and there are plenty I
talk to people at like Google that are
like, ""Oh yeah, I'm in meetings six
hours a day."" I'm like, ""Okay, if you're
in meetings six hours a day, like how
much time are you spending coding?"" ""Oh,
I'm spending eight hours a day coding on
top of those six hour meetings."" I'm
like, ""Oh no."" You know, like uh that
doesn't sound like the lifestyle for for
most of us. certainly not those of us
who have kids. So,
uh you have managed to get a new job and
like what's it like there in terms of
your onboarding experience working
remotely at a pretty big company like
you know hundreds and hundreds of people
um
>> compare and contrast with much smaller
environment you were at before.
>> Yeah. So, uh, the place that I work at
now is a is an education company that
runs an ERP product for, uh, for
teachers and school districts and and
stuff like that. It's definitely a much
bigger company than where I started out
at. Um, there's definitely a lot more
meetings. Um, it's like you said,
there's there's good sides to that,
there's bad sides to that. You know,
there's everything in between. Um, I
definitely agree that uh, meetings are
necessary. It's it's great to know that
everybody's on the same page. Um it's
great sometimes to have a standard um
you know same time every week or same
time every day um standup meeting to
make sure that we all understand what's
what's needing to be done for this week.
Um where are we at on that? You know,
does anybody need any help? Are there
any blockers? Um so yeah, there the
place that I'm at now has definitely a
lot of meetings, but um I think I've so
I'm the team lead where I'm at now and
I've definitely tried to foster an
environment to where we have necessary
meetings. Um when I first came in, we
were uh we were in a two-eek sprint to
where um we did a standup every day. We
did a retrospect every week. We did um
like grooming uh for certain items as we
as we were moving throughout the week.
And um but when I became a team lead, I
decided that I wanted to try to get rid
of some of those meetings because um I
felt like there was just a lot of
sometimes there can be
overcommunication. Sometimes it's like,
okay, we've we've talked about it, we've
talked about it, we've talked about it.
When are we gonna do it? When are we
gonna work? And um I felt like there was
a lot of talking and the the work that
we were trying to get done was falling
behind and I wanted to try to counteract
that. And so um I was I was very blessed
in the fact that I was provided with
some really great team members that um
the limited amount of meetings that we
have have become I would say even more
fruitful than the everyday meetings that
we have. So we used to have meetings
every single day. Now we have them three
times a week. We have them on off days.
And those off days, um, the the meetings
are longer, but I I feel like they're
full of a lot more, um, fruitful
information. The way that I kind of
described it to, uh, my manager the
other day was, uh, it's it's sort of
like being on social media. Sometimes
when you're on social media with your
friends, you see what they're doing
every single day. So that when you
finally see them in person, there's
really not a whole lot to talk about
because you know what they've been up
to, they know what you've been up to.
But if if you're sort of detached from
social media a little bit more, it
becomes a little bit easier to talk to
your friends whenever you see them in
person because I I genuinely don't know
what you've been up to because I'm not
on social media every day. So, um that I
think that's kind of what turned into
our meetings is that because we weren't
meeting every day, whenever we were
meeting, there was a lot to talk about
and there was a lot of in-depth
conversations that we had that became
very fruitful and um provided some
really awesome, you know, uh insight
into what we were doing, what we weren't
doing, what we could be doing better, um
things like that. So that that in sense
meetings I think are really great. I
think meetings get a bad rap sometimes
but it's you know I don't even know if I
would call it a necessary evil. They're
definitely necessary and they can be
good but yeah you're right once they
once they've reached to a certain point
they it almost becomes meaningless. It's
like okay are we talking about this
again?
>> You know [snorts]
>> yeah I mean there's only so much you can
talk about something before you actually
have to roll up your sleeves and do it
right. Sometimes people use meetings as
a way of like
>> subconsciously procrastinating actually
doing the work itself. And of course,
you know, managers can use meetings to
feel more powerful and stuff like that.
Uh
>> yeah, maybe some ego behind it a little
bit, right?
>> But but I try not to like ascribe that
to a manager. I try to presume that like
they're having these meetings because
they need to and and like maybe they can
improve the price performance of those
meetings effectively. Having fewer
meetings, but having those meetings be
more focused. uh or like I like I like
to like I I like to say we shouldn't
have recurring meetings uh unless like
like we should every meeting that's
recurring should have like some sort of
end state where we can disband the
meeting essentially.
>> Yeah, I agree. Yeah, because there are
like committee meetings and stuff that
like just drag on indefinitely and stuff
like that and and there is a place for
that. Like we have weekly huddles um
where we get together and talk kind of
like a agile standup meeting
effectively. Uh but that's just once a
week, right? And then there's not a lot
of meetings. Uh but
>> yeah, it's great that you've been able
to strike a balance and congratulations
to you for being able to
>> give back a whole lot of time to your
team because
>> Oh, thank you. Yeah.
>> Yeah. Three three meetings a week is a
lot less than five meetings a week.
Yeah, my the the lead developer on our
team, that was one of the first things
he said as I told him, I was like, ""Hey,
I want to try to clear some of these
meetings off so you can just work.""
Like, how do you feel about that? And he
he's not a very expressive person, but
he began to laugh and chuckle. He said,
""Man, I' I've been waiting for this for
a long time."" And I said, ""Okay, let's
rock and roll. Let's do this."" And uh
you know, we we've done really well. You
know, um we have roadmap meetings to
where we're supposed to land. And um
thankfully um due to my amazing team,
like we're green across the board, we're
looking to deliver on everything that we
promised. And so, uh, yeah, whatever
whatever we've come up with, it seems to
be working so far, at least.
>> That's awesome. Well, I want to close
with, uh, some questions about like kind
of introversion. Um, you and I, I guess,
both identify as introverts, and I'm not
talking like in terms of like the pop
psychology thing, but like the way I
describe an introvert is just somebody
who would prefer to spend their time
being by themselves or not in a big
group. And probably like 70 80% of the
people listening to this are probably in
would call introverts, but I understand
there's like some pseudocience around it
and stuff like that. I just want to be
clear that I'm not like uh but but you
like to spend time by yourself, right?
And I do too. Like if if I get a chance
to go out and go for a walk by myself, I
absolutely take it. I like to think
introspect, you know, and and you are
somebody who probably has to drain your
batteries a little bit going into and
running a meeting or uh going to a
conference or doing a lot of the other
things that you have to do. Where do you
find the strength to do that?
>> Yeah, I think it's I think it's finding
um you know, time to recharge your
battery outside of work. Um my work now
is very much um an extrovert position.
Um I'm a team lead. I'm on the path to
management right now, which I never
thought I'd say. um kind of being an
introvert, my my dream job uh you know,
especially when I got into coding was
sitting I used to joke I could sit in a
basement for eight hours a day and do
nothing but code and I and I would be
happy and honestly I'd still be that
way. But I think um you know I think
part of growing is um I think it's hard
to grow when you're alone. I think it's
hard to grow when you're not
experiencing other people, when you're
not um part of a community. Um that's
like we talked about the the coding
community. It's hard to do a lot of that
stuff on your own. And so I think I try
to push myself past um you know wanting
to be alone and I try to um you know I I
I try to what's the word I'm trying to
use? I really I I just like to be
involved with other people now. And I
find that it's it's much I'm growing a
lot faster. I'm learning a lot more
things. Um it's providing a lot more um
satisfaction for my job even. Like I
really enjoy my team members. I enjoy
talking with them. I I you know we just
got finished kind of beating on meetings
a little bit but I I really enjoy the
meetings that we have. um getting to
know my team members and um you know but
but whatever I am off work there is a
lot of alone time you know I' I've
recently got into chess a lot so there's
a lot of time thinking and just spending
time alone with my thoughts um I like
video games and I I'm very much a single
game player you know I'm not even
involved in a lot of people whenever I'm
playing games so whenever I'm out of
work I definitely have to hit recharge
and my family is very supportive of that
they understand that once I get off work
hey dad might need some time alone to
himself just a little bit to recharge
his batteries before he's completely,
you know, in family mode again. So, um I
think, you know, work takes everything
out of us. Uh as much as I love my job,
it is a job. It is something that there
are things that I have to do that I
don't want to do. And, um allowing
yourself that time to recharge. And I
think it's just a matter of self-care in
a way, you know. Um it's and sometimes
it can feel a little selfish for
introverts because um sometimes that
self-care does involve, hey, like I just
need me time. I just need me time. And
sometimes you can feel a little selfish
doing that, but uh I would really
encourage people not to feel that way
that um I give everything that I have to
my job. Um I recharge and then I give
everything that I have to my family. So
in that way um I I kind of uh justify it
by saying, you know what, I am taking a
little bit of time for myself, but as
soon as I'm done with that, man, I'm I'm
I'm in a giving mode again. So um I
would just encourage people to try to
find time outside of work. I realize
that work gets everybody down, but once
you're done with work, work is not life,
you know, life begins after work. And uh
once work is done, find a way to
recharge, whatever that might be for
you. And and uh you know, I'm sure
that'll help.
>> Yeah, man. Such uh I love that. Uh give
everything to your job, recharge, give
everything to your family. I think those
are
flow to live by uh for people out there
trying to find balance in their life.
>> Patrick, it's been an absolute pleasure
talking with you. Thanks for everything
you're doing. Uh just, you know, going
to talks and sharing. uh you had this
excellent uh talk on Angular which is
probably pretty dated that I enjoyed
watching
many years ago uh learning about Angular
and and the .NET ecosystem but it's
clear that you're like a good technical
communicator. So uh I as time permits
with your busy job and your busy family
like we we'd welcome more contributions
from you in the global free co developer
community.
>> Yeah, of course. I'd love that.
>> Yeah. Well, everybody tuning in uh I
hope you're having a fantastic day.
Until next week, happy coding. Happy
coding."

Hello world. My name is David Men and
this is CS50's introduction to cyber
security for technical and non-technical
audiences alike. In this course, you'll
learn how to secure your accounts, data,
systems, and software against today's
threats and how to recognize and
evaluate tomorrow's as well, both at
home and at work. You'll learn how to
preserve your own privacy. You'll learn
how to view cyber security not in
absolute terms, but relative, a function
of risks and rewards for an adversary,
and costs and benefits for you. and
you'll learn to recognize cyber security
as a trade-off with usability itself. In
the world of cyber security, I dare say
you and I have to be perfect. All of our
doors, all of our windows, virtually
speaking, have to be locked. But an
adversary has to find just one mistake
that we've made, a single door or
window, a jar. So perhaps we should be
focused not only on prevention but on
detection especially through auditing
through monitoring so that even if an
adversary gets in we can at least detect
as much quickly and minimize the
downsides for us and in turn the upsides
for them. Perhaps nowadays tools like
artificial intelligence or AI can even
help with that detecting patterns and
potential adversaries behavior that we
might not even notice ourselves. And
perhaps if we raise the bar high enough
for the adversary, increasing their
cost, their risk, decreasing their
potential reward, they'll simply lose
interest in us as a target. Of course,
if they have more resources than us,
they might very well win anyway. But
will they be even interested in us?
Which of these threats should we
actually worry about? Throughout this
course, we'll present both highlevel and
low-level examples of threats and
provide you with all you need to know
technically to understand both, even if
you're not a programmer or computer
person yourself. Through those examples,
we'll introduce you to certain first
principles how computers themselves
work, so that you can understand and
deduce even after the course ends how
other threats that the world might not
have even seen yet actually work. This
is CS50's introduction to cyber
security.
All right, this is CS50's introduction
to cyber security. My name is David Men
and this week let's focus on securing
accounts. You and I have so many
accounts nowadays, be it for websites or
apps or the like. And we'll focus today
on exactly what the threats are to all
of those accounts, but more importantly,
what some of the defenses are so that
you can keep those accounts secure. But
let's first consider what we mean by
security in the physical world. For
instance, whether you live in a home, an
apartment, a dormatory, or the like,
odds are you have a key that lets you
into that building. Now that key of
course lets you in through that locked
door and then you have access to the
entire uh habitat. But the catch is that
if someone else gets that key of course
they too can let themselves into that
system or into that same building. So
let's consider now in the digital world
though what some of the building blocks
are of security so that we can focus
exactly what those threats and what
those defenses are. So first allow me to
propose that we think about the security
of our accounts in terms of
authentication. So authentication refers
to this process digitally of proving who
you are. That I for instance am David.
But that alone isn't necessarily enough
to keep a system secure because just
because I'm David doesn't necessarily
mean I should have access to your entire
home. Perhaps I should have not have
access at all. Perhaps I should just
have access to the entryway or some
narrower form of access. And so there's
this related topic when it comes to the
security of locations or systems known
as authorization. So authorization
speaks to whether or not you should have
access to something once you have proven
that you are you that I am David and
that I should in fact have access to the
door that I just walked through. Now
when it comes to our accounts in the
digital world, we of course don't use
physical keys, but very frequently
nowadays we use usernames which of
course can be public. It might be a
username like David. It might be a
username like Men. Or it might be more
commonly even an entire email address
that presumably uniquely identifies you
in the world. But the even though that's
public, the thing that you and I ideally
keep private is, of course, our
password. And nowadays, you and I must
have dozens, maybe even hundreds of
passwords that are hopefully distinct
and not reused across all of those
different websites. But more on that in
a moment. And so it's really this
password that ultimately allows you to
authenticate yourself, demonstrate who
you are because presumably I am the only
one in the world that knows not only my
username or email address, which all of
us can know, but presumably I'm the only
one in the world that knows my username
and this here password. And so the
presumption is if I type in both of
those values to some app or some website
that I must in fact be David Men in that
case. Of course, it's not good enough to
just have a password. You need to have a
good password. Now, what do we mean by
good password? Well, ideally, this
password is not going to be in a a
dictionary. Like literally a dictionary
of English words or whatever your human
language might be. Why? Well, there's
this threat known as a dictionary
attack. And by this, I mean an
adversary, a hacker that wants to get
into your account. They could just start
typing randomly to try to figure out
what your password is. But they're a
little smarter. They'll actually use a
dictionary attack. That is, they'll open
a physical book of words or more likely
they'll open a file on their computer
containing a whole lot of actual English
words or in some other human language
and then just one at a time try this
word as your password, this word as your
password, this word as your password and
so forth. Because if you and I have
chosen a pretty guessable password, one
that is an actual word in a dictionary,
they're going to get into your account
much faster. But even if you and I are
clever, and odds are by this point in
life, you you know that you shouldn't
just choose a simple English or some
other language word, but rather you
should probably have some numbers, some
letters, some punctuation or the like,
you're still vulnerable, as am I, to
what we'd know, we'd call a brute force
attack. Brute four sort of uh evokes the
memories of yester year where uh one one
uh where someone might have had a big uh
a branch of a tree using as a battering
ram trying to get into the castles from
past times. But brute force attacks in
the digital world mean something
analogously whereby you're using
software to digitally try all possible
passwords. And so here too are you
vulnerable because if your password is
too short, even if it's random with
letters, numbers, and symbols, odds are
an adversary or a hacker that has enough
time and enough technical savvy, they
can just try every possible password in
the world and eventually they might very
well get into your system. So how do we
go about defending against these kinds
of attacks? Well, we use these
passwords, but these passwords, of
course, come in different forms. And
it's kind of a a low bar that is set by
default on a lot of devices still
nowadays. For instance, on your phone,
if you'd like to chime in here in the
chat, how many uh characters or digits
in particular are typically required of
systems? Well, I would conjecture that
very often when I set up a phone, I'm
only asked for a passcode, a numeric
password of four digits alone. Now, if
you have a fourdigit passcode or
password more generally, how secure is
that? And how do we even go about
thinking about how secure that password
is? Well, I would propose that we could
start to measure, not even using fancy
math, but just some basic heruristics.
We could measure the security of a
password that has just four digits by
considering, well, how many possible
four-digit passcodes are there? So
perhaps if you'd like to chime in here
in the chat, how many possible passwords
are there? If they're all digits, 0ero
through nine, decimal digits, and if you
only have four of them, how many
possibilities are there? I'm seeing
a,000. I'm seeing 10,000. I'm think
seeing 9,999.
And I'm seeing a whole range. And I
think a lot of you have the the answer
spot on. It's 10,000. It's 10,000. Why?
Well, if we just think about this
numerically, if I've got four decimal
digits 0 through 9, well, the smallest
password I could come up with, so to
speak, would be 0000. And the largest
password I could come up with would be
9999. Now, you might think, okay, well,
that's obviously 9,999
possibilities, but not quite because if
you include 0000,
that's the 10,000th possibility. So
indeed, there's 10,000 possible
passwords if we're using four digits
specifically. So how do we actually
think about that more generally,
especially so that we can now figure out
the math for larger passwords as well?
Well, if you've got 0 through 9 as the
first possible digit and 0 through 9 as
the next, and 0 through nine is the
third and 0 through 9 as the fourth, you
have 10 possibilities time 10
possibilities 10 x 10. This, of course,
if we do it out more mathematically, is
uh 10^ the 4th power. the exponent being
four and that of course gives us 10,000
as well. So that might be the more
mathematical way approaching of
approaching it versus just the more
intuitive that 0000 can go all the way
up to 99999. Now again a question for
the group how long do you think it might
take for an adversary or a hacker to get
into my device for instance my phone if
I do have a fourdigit password. If I've
got a four-digit password, this means
they might have to try as many as 10,000
possibilities because in the easiest
case, sure, I get l they get lucky and
my password is still the default 0000.
But in the worst case, I chose 9999 and
they don't get to that until the very
end of their attempts. Or maybe I choose
something there in between. I'm seeing
10 seconds, less than a second,
milliseconds, 10 seconds, a day, 4
hours. Okay, so the the responses are
all over the place. So, how could we go
about actually measuring this or
estimating this? Well, let me propose
this. I'm going to go over to my
computer here. And even if you've never
written any code before, let's go ahead
and write some code together here. I'm
going to go ahead and open a program
called VS Code, Visual Studio Code,
which is a free program that we use in
CS50 more generally that allows me to
write code on my Mac or PC or really any
internet-based device. And I can
actually write code and not only write
it, but run it. And I'm going to write
code in this case in a language called
Python. And this is just a very popular
language, but I could use any of a dozen
or more different programming languages.
And the goal here is not to learn
Python. For that, we have whole other
classes, but to just demonstrate what an
adversary, what a hacker need do if they
want to get into, for instance, your
iPhone or Android device or anything
that has just a fourdigit password. Now,
my presumption here for demonstration
sake is that I'm going to go ahead and
write code that just prints all possible
passwords on the screen, but you could
imagine if I had a USB cable or maybe a
lightning cable, I could connect this
phone to this laptop. Especially if it's
your phone that I just swiped from a
table, could quickly plug it into my
computer here, run the code that I'm
about to write, and maybe automatically
send all 10,000 possibilities to your
device before you even realize the phone
is gone. Now, here's how I'm going to do
this. I'm going to go ahead and in a
text file called crack.py, where crack
is actually a term of art. It just means
to figure out what a password is to
brute force your way in. I'm going to go
ahead and from a library called string,
I'm going to go ahead and import digits.
Now, this is a very easy way of just
giving me access to the numbers 0
through nine. I could obviously type
them all out on my keyboard. This is a
little faster because this gives me like
a list of the numbers I care about. Now,
there's a bunch of different ways I can
write this code, but what I really want
to do intuitively is try all possible
digits for the first value. Try all
possible digits for the second, then for
the third, then for the fourth. So, one
way of doing this might be as follows.
I'm going to use a keyword in Python
called four, which just means do
something for as long as I want you to.
And then I'm going to give myself a
variable like in math, just so I can use
something to keep track of each number.
And I'm going to use a default value of
I for integer. And then I'm going to go
ahead and say that for each value I in
those 10 digits I want to go ahead and
do the following. Well, for each of
those I digits for the first value I
want to do for J in digits as well. And
then for each value for my third
placeholder I might do something like
for K in digits. And then lastly I might
do for L in digits. So this is
admittedly not the best design. And
those of you who have programmed before
are probably cringing that I have this
indentation, indentation, indentation.
But it's a simple way of demonstrating,
especially for those unfamiliar with
programming, how we can try all possible
first digits, all possible second, all
possible third, all possible fourth. And
all I'm going to do very inside of this
code now is print out the value of I, J,
K, and L. So that iteratively we should
see on the screen 0000
and then all the way up to 9999. So, if
you assume that I've connected my phone
to this laptop, ideally then we'll have
an estimation of how long it might take
until we actually have cracked into the
device. So, let's go ahead and do this.
I'm going to open up a separate window
on my screen here. It's called a
terminal window and I'm going to go
ahead and run Python of crack.py. So, in
just a moment, we're going to see is it
going to take a few minutes, a few
milliseconds, a day, four hours, or Here
we go. 1 2 3 go. Okay, so those of you
who estimated just a few milliseconds
were spoton. So what's the takeaway
here? Well, apparently using a fourdigit
password is not very secure at all
because look how quickly I, the
adversary or the hacker in the story was
able to get into your phone. And in
fact, I could probably unplug it at that
point because I've gotten whatever data
I care about off your phone and you
might not be none the wiser. So how can
we go about improving upon this system?
Well, let me propose that instead of
using a fourdigit passcode, let's use
four letters instead. And we'll use
English because that's what I speak
well. And in English, we have 26 letters
of the alphabet, A through Z. But you
know what? That might give us initially
26 possibilities for the first uh
position time 26 * 26* 26 for the second
through 4th. But let me propose that we
actually use lowercase and uppercase
letters. So that gives me not 26 but 52
possibilities for each location. So, if
I do 52 possibilities, that's 52 to the
4th power. And does anyone want to
estimate how many possible passwords
there are? If I'm using four English
letters now, uppercase or lowercase,
I'm seeing 26 to the 4th power, but
that's not right. If we're using
uppercase and lowerase, it's indeed 52
to the fourth power. And I'm seeing a
lot. But here we have estimates along
the lines of indeed 7 million as well.
So with 7 million possibilities, you
might think, okay, surely that's going
to be a lot better and it's going to
take the adversary a lot longer to hack
into this phone. But let's try that. Let
me go back to my terminal window here.
Let me reopen now my code file. And
let's go ahead and use not digits, but
let's go ahead and use ASI letters. For
those unfamiliar, ASKI letters are
simply the letters A through Z in both
uppercase and lowercase. Now here I go
have to go ahead and change this from
digits to ASKY letters. From digits to
ASKY letters, from digits to asy
letters. And lastly, from digits to asky
letters. Again, there's an easier way I
could implement this code to be more
succinct and less duplicative, but it
involves some features that we'll
introduce in another class al together.
But now I have all possible asky letters
from my first placeholder to the last.
Let's go ahead and open up that same
terminal window. Let's run Python of
crack.py. And here now is the answer to
how long might it take an adversary to
get into your phone if you're using four
letters of the English alphabet for your
password instead.
Okay. So this time I have enough
[laughter] time to walk all the way over
to the screen here. And you can see that
we're going in alphabetical order. First
lowerase now uppercase. But in just a
moment, we are done. And we're down all
the way to Zzz. So that was a few
seconds, which is indeed slower. But
that really wasn't that much effort at
all. So presumably then even four
letters of the alphabet might not be
enough to keep us secure. So let me go
ahead and do what we all are told to do
anyway, which is to go into your phone
or whatever device in question and
actually use four characters perhaps
instead. So not just letters, not just
digits, but let's toss in some
punctuation as well. And in the world of
punctuation, at least on a US English
keyboard, there's typically as many as
94 possibilities for letters, numbers,
and punctuation because we have 26
lowercase letters, 26 uppercase letters,
10 decimal digits, 0 through 9, and
another 32 punctuation symbols that we
can add into the mix as well. So, that
gives me 94 possible keys that I can hit
here, or 94 to the fourth power. And
does anyone want to estimate what this
is? We've gone from 10,000 to 7 million
to I'm seeing it indeed in the chat
roughly 78 million possibilities. So in
some sense 10 times more secure. Let's
go back to my terminal window, open up
my code here and import not only ask
letters but also the digits from before
and also this time some punctuation as
well. Now let's go ahead and change just
the asky letters alone to asky letters
plus those digits plus that punctuation.
And just to save some time, I'm going to
highlight and copy what I just typed.
And I'm going to change the second
position, the third position, and the
fourth position as well to use that
combination of 94 possibilities. I'm
going to open up my terminal window
again. I'm going to run Python of
crack.py. And this time, because we have
10 times as many possibilities, I kind
of had 10 times the amount of time to
walk over to the screen because indeed
we're still in the lowercase E, Fs, G's,
H's. And now it looks a bit like a
Hollywood movie. Maybe you can perhaps
see even though it's going across the
screen fast that there's a lot of
cryptic output here because we're
running through all of the letters, the
digits, and the punctuation. So, it
looks a little fancy at that. Now, you
might recall too from Hollywood movies
too that they tend to be very dramatic.
And so instead of just doing this, which
is iterating from left to right very
slowly, the movies and TV shows tend to
very dramatically get like the third
character right, then the first
character right, then the fourth
character right, and then just in time
you get the second one as well. Like
that's not really how brute force works.
You tend to do things methodically, not
jumping around from symbol to symbol.
But this is clearly taking a long time
and I'm not even going to finish waiting
for this to go because we still have to
get through all the punctuation. So this
is to say ultimately that 78 million
possibilities is actually getting up
there pretty fast. But honestly, if we
come back in like a minute or so, I bet
that will be finished nonetheless. And
none of us hopefully has a password
that's only four characters nowadays.
Letters, numbers, and and punctuation.
Odds are it's at least a conventional
eight characters. And indeed most
websites and apps require as much of you
as well. Now the math here is pretty
straightforward too. If you have 94
possibilities but you have eight
characters in total now that's 94 to the
eth power and does anyone want to
ballpark just how many passwords are
possible if it's only eight characters
which isn't even that long
but you have eight of them total. Too
many it comes back one answer too much
to count. Okay, I see that we've given
up here, but oh, I did see one in the
chat. It's roughly this many possible
passwords, which is actually a little
hard to figure out. So, this is, let's
see, millions, billions, trillions,
quadrillion. So, this is six quadrillion
possibilities. So now we're talking now
the adversary is probably going to run
out of time, run out of uh energy, run
out of money, run out of lifetime if
it's going to take this much time to try
to crack, so to speak, your particular
password. And so here's one of our first
takeaways when it comes to cyber
security and securing our accounts. It
really is this game of relativity and
resources. What we're really doing here
is not something fundamentally different
by adding in digits and numbers, digits
and letters and punctuation. It's sort
of still the same formula, the same
approach to our passwords. But as we add
complexity and as we make it longer and
longer, we're raising the bar to the
adversary. Why? Well, so long as you and
I don't do something dumb like still
choose 000000.
So long as we're choosing something
that's pretty random in that range of
six quadrillion possibilities, it's
going to take the adversary way more
time than it would otherwise to brute
force their way into that password. And
so by the time they finally get into the
account, you might have changed the
password already. You might not be using
the account anymore or you or the
adversary might not even be on this
planet anymore. And that's indeed the
goal. But there is a downside, of
course. the longer your password gets
and the more complicated it gets, the
more likely you and I are to not even be
able to remember what that password is.
And so here is that sort of balancing
act trying to figure out this balance
between the usability of the account,
just how userfriendly it is to access
versus the security of that account and
finding that inflection point is
somewhat personal or somewhat corporate
in policy typically. Well, let me pause
here and see if there are any questions
now on securing our accounts via
passwords alone.
>> Um, I was wondering uh a couple of years
ago there were devices, USB devices with
um fingerprint recognition.
How come that's not more frequently
used? Were they too expensive or
>> a really good question and we'll come to
this topic in a little bit on biometrics
more generally, but your intuition is
pretty much right. It's expensive to
have in another device and most
consumers are not going to bother
wasting money on something just for
them. Some companies might, but if they
have a lot of employees, that could get
very costly. But you might be glad to
know that one of the topics we'll end on
today is a new technology called pass
keys that actually leverages a device
you most likely already have, a phone
that might use your fingerprint or might
use your face or some other form of
biometrics. That's becoming more common
nowadays or soon will even for your
laptop and desktop which will talk to
that phone in some form. How about one
more question here on securing accounts?
>> My question is uh why uh is why if uh
four digits password is is so unsafe why
some program still is using this
password not a website like program?
>> Oh really good question. Why are some
programmers using this? So, it's a
trade-off between usability and
security. If you are the programmer
designing the system, you presumably
want users to use the system and to come
back and to keep using it. But if you
make it too hard for them to access that
account, if you increase the probability
that they're going to constantly forget
their password, lose their password,
they might just stop using your system
or your app or your website altogether.
And so, that's probably not a good
thing. Um, other reasons might include
just unawareness or not having taken a
class on cyber security or not really
have thought not having really thought
through the implications of having such
short passcodes. So nowadays is industry
starting to nudge us in better and
better directions. But we'll see today
in the rest of this class that there are
still going to be a lot of trade-offs
again between usability and security. So
what can we do to defend ourselves
against these brute force attacks? Well,
at least here in the US, there's an
organization called the National
Institute of Standards and Technology,
otherwise known as NIST, that actually
issues recommendations for how we as
consumers or companies or more generally
humans can go about securing their
accounts more effectively. And we
thought we'd share just some of these
recommendations, those that it informs
not only your own behavior as a
individual citizen or consumer, but
perhaps if you're in a place of business
where you can influence your own
company's policies. here are generally
what are considered best practices
nowadays. So a quote from their
recommendations, memorized secrets shall
be at least eight characters in length.
So that at least corroborates the quick
math and the test that we ourselves just
ran that only once we got up to like six
quadrillion possibilities did it feel
like it was going to take a very long
time to actually hack into someone's
device. So consider that for your own
accounts. Even on your phones, you might
have to go through a few menu options to
upgrade from just four digits to
something more. But odds are you'll
benefit from this additional layer of
security. This one's more of a mouthful,
but helpful as well. Verifiers, so the
website or app that's verifying your
input when you authenticate with your
username and password. Verifiers should
permit subscriber chosen memorized
secrets of at least 64 characters in
length. All printing asy characters as
well as the space characters should be
acceptable in memorize secrets. Unicode
characters should be accepted as well.
Now, if you're not yourself a computer
person, there's a bit of jargon within
this, but first of all, the takeaways
are that websites and applications
should let you and me come up with
passwords that are actually as long as
64 characters. Now, that's pretty long,
but that's exactly the point.
Particularly as it's gotten more
difficult for you and I to remember all
of our passwords, to come up with very
complex passwords, the reality is you
and I might very well be better off on
the whole by just choosing an easier to
remember but much longer password. For
instance, a sentence, a quote, a phrase
that you can more easily keep in your
human mind, but that doesn't necessarily
have a crazy amount of punctuation or
digits or letters, but at least is it 64
characters in length. So, even if an
adversary tries a dictionary attack,
trying all possible English words or
some other language, even if they try a
brute force attack, it's going to take
them way too long. Unless of course you
do something foolish like choose a 64
character passcode that's 0 0 0 or so
forth. So you still want to be original
within that space. Now more technically
this recommendation is referring to ASI.
ASI generally refers to US English
symbols on a US English keyboard as was
the origin of this code system. Um so
that includes A through Z, 0 through
9ine and the punctuation I alluded to
earlier. But websites and apps nowadays
should also support Unicode, including
things like emoji and other accented
characters um or symbols that you might
have in languages beyond English.
Unfortunately, this is not really common
practice, I dare say. Just yesterday, I
created an account on a new website for
the first time, and it made me jump
through hoops, so to speak, figuring out
the right number of uppercase letters,
lowercase letters, punctuation, and even
then it told me I could only use certain
punctuation. So I had to think about now
which symbols I'm using. That is a lot
of friction. That is not good for
usability and it's of questionable value
for the security of the system. If I
can't even remember the thing afterward.
So keep this in mind in general that
your password should not only be at
eight characters minimally, but most
apps and websites you maybe yourself
develop moving forward should allow much
longer passwords as well. And you as the
human can use longer passwords if
systems allow them as well. Now, here's
another set of recommendations from
NIST. Verifiers, the website or the apps
that we're using shall compare the
prospective secrets, the passwords
you're choosing against a list that
contains values known to be commonly
used, expected, or compromised. So, that
is to say, when you type in a password,
if it's already been a commonly used
password, if it's very easily guessable,
the website or app should probably say,
""Uh-uh, pick a better password than
that."" just to decrease the probability
that an adversary is going to get into
that account. Specifically, NIST
recommends that passwords obtained from
previous breach corpuses, which is a
fancy way of saying if some website,
some database has been hacked and that
database contains usernames and
passwords and those passwords have now
been uploaded to the internet for
adversaries or anyone to download and
browse. Well, then you should not be
allowed to pick a password from that
list because it's essentially an
alternative dictionary. It essentially
is a list of passwords that a smart
adversary should just start with before
they even bother resorting to brute
force, which we've seen would take much
more time. Two, dictionary words. So,
this we've already stipulated would be a
good thing to avoid because it's just
much too easy for an adversary to go
through a big list of English words or
some other language and try those first.
Three, repetitive or sequential
characters. A a a a or slightly more
creatively but not good enough one two
three 4 ABC D. I would also add 000000
and so forth into that category as well.
It's just too easy for the adversary to
guess that maybe you're doing something
repetitive like that too. And then
lastly, context specific words such as
the name of the service, the username,
and derivatives thereof. This is to say
if you sign up for a Gmail account for
the first time, you should not be
allowed by Google to choose a password
like Gmail password, quote unquote. If
you sign up for an Amazon account, you
should not be allowed by Amazon to have
your password be Amazon password or some
such variant thereof because smart
adversaries are going to try those same
heristics. And that's the catch, too. If
you can think of it, even if you think
you're being clever, odds are a just as
clever adversary can think of that
heristic as well. and prioritize those
tricks before they resort to brute force
like I did on my own laptop. A few other
recommendations as well. Memorized
secret verifiers shall not permit the
subscriber to sure to store a hint that
is inaccessible to an unauthenticated
claimant. Verifiers shall not prompt
subscribers to use specific types of
information. For instance, what was the
name of your first pet when choosing
memorized secrets. So there are a lot of
companies, a lot of websites, a lot of
applications that violate this
recommendation nowadays. And in fact, I
bet you can think of one or more
accounts that you have where you've had
to tell them, for instance, what was the
name of your first pet or your first car
or your mother or father's name or the
like. That's not good to collect either.
nor is a hint a good thing because
frankly you and I are all too often in
the habit of maybe typing into that hint
field if it's available a question
that's meant to help you remember what
your password was but if your hint is
something like my password is the name
of my first pet well you're now just
leaking information to the world and
anyone who can go online and figure out
that information can now get into your
account as well and so that's really the
threat in this case if you start using
personally identifiable information in
this age of social media and websites
like LinkedIn and the like. There's just
so much information out there about us
that can be discovered. You don't want
to fill all of these databases, all of
these systems with each of these tidbits
about you because a smart adversary with
enough time and enough focus on you can
probably figure out all of those same
values. So what more verifiers shall not
require memorized secrets to be changed
arbitrarily for instance periodically.
So this one too is something that a lot
of companies violate as a re
recommendation still. If you're in a
corporate workplace in particular and
you're being required by the system
administrators to change your password
every month, maybe every 3 months, 6
months, every year perhaps. That's not
generally recommended anymore. Even
though not too long ago it did feel like
sound like a best practice. But why is
this not recommended anymore to have you
forcibly change your password
periodically like every few months?
>> Because the password will be easily
forgotten and be more vulnerable to
brute force attacks.
>> Why would it be more vulnerable? because
the hackers can get access to to all
password and get hints about the new
password.
>> Okay. So yes, one danger of forcing you
and me to change our password too
frequently is that you and I do not tend
to exert much effort when we're required
to do so. For instance, if my password
today is for instance password one,
well, you know what my password might be
in three months? Password two. Or in
another three months, password three.
you and I might exert the minimal amount
of energy to change the password so that
we meet the company's requirements, but
so that it's not too hard for you and me
to remember what the new password is.
And so indeed, if information about my
past passwords leaks out and some
adversary sees, oh well, wait a minute,
your password was password two last
month, I'm just going to guess
heristically that this month it's
password three. We might indeed be
leaking information. What's another
reason that you might not want to
require humans to change their passwords
arbitrarily on some schedule like this?
>> Okay. Uh we keep forgetting our
passwords too uh if we change it too
frequently. So that is not a good
practice for a website.
>> Exactly. If you make me change my
password too frequently, honestly, I'm
probably going to forget what my next
password is because I'm going to get
confused with last months or the
previous months or the like. And so
there's these sociological effects on us
humans just being human not being very
good at remembering not only the first
password you made me choose that's very
complex but the second and the third as
well. And so generally you should not
come up with such a scheme anymore
because of these adverse side effects.
And how about one more recommendation
here? Verifiers shall implement a rate
limiting mechanism that effectively
limits the number of failed
authentication attempts that can be made
on the subscribers account. Now what do
we mean by this? Well, odds are this is
something you yourselves might have
experienced if for instance you forgot
your password or you kept typing it
slightly wrong. Maybe your phone's
screen was wet so it wasn't registering
your fingertips properly. It turns out
you can lock yourself out of your own
phone and you might have in fact seen
something like this on iPhone. Android
has a similar screen if for instance you
type in the wrong passcode 10 times in a
row. The presumption by Apple and Google
and others is that if after 10 times you
still haven't inputed your password
correctly, it's probably a higher
probability that you are not David, that
you are not you, but rather it's someone
else who has taken your phone, stolen
your phone, and is trying to get into
it. Now, that's not always the case. You
can imagine situations where you just
were being absent- minded. You were half
asleep. Maybe you weren't really
focusing on it, and you locked yourself
out. And so there too is again a
trade-off between usability and
security. But the higher probability
event after 10 wrong attempts probably
tends to be that it's an adversary
trying to get in and not you. But what's
the point of this? Beyond annoying the
adversary and maybe more significantly
really annoying you when it happens by
accident. What this effectively does is
it slows the adversary down. In other
words, it increases the cost of this
attack to the adversary. Why? Well, we
saw a moment ago that a smart adversary
who knows a little bit of Python code
and steals your phone can try 10,000
possible passwords in just less than a
second. However, if you now slow them
down by having this feature on on your
iPhone or Android device that pumps the
brakes, so to speak, that lets the
adversary try no more than 10 at a time,
that significantly slows them down. Now,
they might have to spend at least 10
seconds, 20 seconds, an hour, a day or
longer, especially since what Android
and iPhone also do is they tend to
increase this time limit. The first time
you mess up, it's 1 minute. If you mess
up another 10 times, it's now two
minutes, maybe five minutes, maybe 10
minutes. Maybe the phone even deletes
itself, wipes itself if that too is a
feature that you or your company has
enabled. So again, the right way to
think about this beyond the usability
trade-off is that we're just trying to
raise the bar to the adversary. We're
trying to make it more expensive, more
costly, maybe more risky to the
adversary by slowing them down. And by
more risky, I mean if this is like a
Hollywood moment and someone's just
stolen the phone from your your table at
Starbucks or a coffee shop, they've
plugged it into their laptop, they're
trying desperately to crack into it
before you come back to the table. Well,
by slowing them down, it's going to
significantly increase the risk too that
they are caught in the act while doing
it. And hopefully too, the goal is to
just get them to lose interest in your
phone, lose interest in your account,
and have them move on to ideally no one
else's, but at least barring that,
someone else's instead of yours.
So, what are other defenses against
these kinds of brute force attacks or
even these dictionary attacks? Well,
this is a system that you and I are
increasingly being able to uh turn on,
but also increasingly are being required
to turn on as well, which is in general
probably a good thing. Two-factor
authentication or 2FA, more generally
known as multiffactor authentication, is
a technology whereby in addition to
having one factor that you use to log
in, like your password, as is tradition,
you also have a second or maybe more
factors that you additionally have to
use in order to log in. But these
factors don't just generally mean one
password, two passwords, three
passwords, or the like. They're
fundamentally different types of
factors. And in general, they're broken
down into these three categories. One is
a knowledge category. A knowledge factor
is just something that you know,
something like your password that
ideally you keep secret. No one else
knows. And that's why it enables you to
authenticate yourself. Prove that you
are you because you and only you
hopefully have that knowledge. But a
second type of factor would be a
possession factor. Something that you
physically have. So you might be in the
habit at work of carrying around one of
those little key fobs that has a little
code on it that changes. Now those
things can be expensive. So increasingly
the world is just using our own phones,
your own Android phone, your own iPhone
that maybe has uh SMS support on it,
text messaging, or maybe a specific app
that displays a short code that you type
in. The presumption is if that you
challenge the user not only for a
knowledge factor like their password but
a second factor like something they
possess, you significantly decrease the
probability that an adversary is going
to be able to get into that account.
Because whereas anyone on the internet,
millions of people can be a threat to
you by just figuring out or finding your
password, a possession factor really
narrows the scope of the threat to only
the other customers in Starbucks or the
coffee shop. only the other people
physically near you because they would
have to physically obtain that second
possession factor. And then a third type
of factor nowadays might be an inherent
something that is unique to you
specifically more generally described as
biometrics. So maybe it's your
fingerprints, maybe it is your face
nowadays. Something that's inherent to
you can be a third factor nowadays
because the presumption is that only you
ideally in the world have exactly that
factor as well. Now, this is a little
different from what some companies, some
websites, some apps describe as two-step
authentication, where two steps might
actually just be two passwords of some
sort. But to factor more technically
refers to two or more of these types of
fundamentally different factors, that
being the most common in our case here.
Now, when it comes to those possession
factors, those key fobs or the apps or
the codes that you receive,
specifically, what you're receiving in
those models is generally known as a
one-time password or OTP. The the idea
being that this is not a password that
you know and keep remembering and keep
using again and again. It's literally
one time because it's texted to you or
it's sent via an app, via push
notification, or it's actually sent to
something on your uh on your keychain
like this here key fob for instance.
Nowadays, your company can buy these and
what happens is on the screen here, this
one-time password constantly changes
every few seconds and it's synchronized
somehow with a server. So that the
presumption is if I am carrying around
this device and I type in when prompted
this particular code and that code
matches the synchronized code that's on
the server, I should be allowed into the
account because the presumption is that
it's indeed David carrying this around
and not necessarily some adversary. It
might also be possible to plug it in as
via USB or some other technology,
thereby removing the human from the
formula so that the device itself can
just authenticate using special software
on the system instead. Nowadays though,
you can download special apps, whether
it's one from Google or other companies
that allow you to manage all in one
place all of these one-time passwords
that you might automatically see
updating on the screen and you can type
any or all of them in when you're
actually prompted by a website or app.
But even in this space of one-time
passwords and possession factors, it's
worth keeping in mind that some of these
technologies are more secure than
others. Now, it's very common for
websites or apps nowadays to want to
send you one of these one-time passwords
via text message, for instance, and you
receive it via SMS, and then you can
type in that six-digit code, as is often
the case. More secure though would be
something like an actual app that you
install from the App Store or the Google
Play Store that actually talks directly
to some server and does not just go over
the cellular phone network. Why is that?
Well, as you might know, in your phone
is typically a SIM card, either a
physical card, a little chip, or
nowadays it might actually be built into
the phone as well. But that SIM card has
a unique identifier. And when you sign
up for phone service, typically with a
company, they need to know what the
unique identifier is of your SIM card,
be it something physical or something
wired, hardwired into your device. Why?
Because that's how they associate your
phone number with that specific device.
The catch is that it's all too possible
and in some cases all too easy to trick
even the phone companies into swapping
your SIM. not necessarily doing it
physically per se, but convincing the
mobile phone carriers to update their
system to say, ""Oh, David now has this
SIM card and not that original one.""
That is to say, if I'm an adversary and
I just have any old phone with any old
SIM card in, I figure out what the
unique ID is and maybe I call up David's
mobile phone provider and I somehow
convince them that I am David by
tricking them into believing it's me as
by telling them all of those personal
information, all of that personal
information about myself, I might be
able to convince them to swap my SIM
card, the adversaries, with what is
already on file. The implication of that
is that when David subsequently gets
text messages, they don't actually go to
me, the real David. They go to the
adversar's phone as well because they're
tied to that SIM card. So, in general
nowadays, if you have a choice using
some website or app to use SMS or
textbased uh messaging versus a native
application that you install onto your
phone or other device, you should
generally prefer the latter. some first
class piece of software that actually
uses push notifications or your data
plan and does not rely on SMS text
messaging because of this potential
threat.
So, what are still other threats when it
comes to these systems? Well, it turns
out that it's very possible,
unfortunately, for adversaries to
somehow get software, malicious
software, otherwise known as malware,
onto your Mac, onto your PC, perhaps
even onto your phone. This might be
because you installed a piece of
software that you shouldn't have
trusted. This might be because your
phone or your device is infected with
something like a virus or a worm. But in
general, you might be vulnerable to
malware, including software that logs
all of your keystrokes. Key logging
refers to exactly that, some piece of
software that most likely maliciously is
literally recording everything you type
or everything you tap into that device.
And what does this software do with
those keystrokes? Very often, it will
upload them. if there's an internet
connection, maybe to a server that the
adversary controls. Now, what's the
implication of this key logging threat?
Well, if you're typing in your username,
that's not such a big deal because those
are generally public. But if you're
typing in your password and that's being
automatically uploaded to the adversary
server, now they know your username and
your password. Worse, if the adversary
also sees you typing in that six-digit
code, your one-time password that you
might have received even from your phone
or some other device, if they are fast
enough and smart enough and figure out
how to log what you're typing, send it
to the server, perhaps even before you
yourself hit enter, maybe they can use
not only your username and your
password, but even that one-time
password by pretending to be you on
their own phone or their own laptop or
desktop typing in or more realistically
automatically through software typing in
those same values and accessing your
account even before you had a chance to
do so as well. Now what are the defenses
against that particular threat? Really
just to be generally paranoid about what
computers you yourself use. For
instance, nowadays I will rarely if ever
actually use like a a an internet cafe's
computer or even a lab computer here at
Harvard's campus or frankly even a
friend's computer because I don't know
just how safe they are when it comes to
best practices using their device on the
internet. I will in general only log
into websites and apps on my own
personal devices which isn't to say that
I too am perfect but rather at least I'm
reducing the probability that I lose
control over my data by using some other
device that I myself don't oversee uh by
that person that owner not themselves
adhering to best practices. Now, even
then, I will admit that using key
logging and getting it up to an
adversary server and inputting it faster
than you might is a pretty sophisticated
and difficult threat, but it's worth
keeping about. Think it's worth keeping
in mind and realizing that these are
certainly theoretical uh attacks and if
you yourself are targeted for some
reason, these are absolutely things you
should be mindful of. So in general if
you have the luxury of only using your
own device and not some shared device
that too tends to be best practice I
would say. All right any questions on
these here attacks
>> regarding using long passwords. Do you
recommend using like Google passwords or
Apple passwords for the system to
remember the passwords for us?
>> A really good question. Um short answer
yes but we'll come to that in more
detail in just a few minutes. So what
are other attacks that we should be
mindful of? So this one has kind of a
funny name, but there's this attack
known as credential stuffing. And we've
seen we've come across reference to this
already in this discussion thus far.
Credential stuffing. A credential is
something like a username and password.
Um refers to the process of an adversary
having found a whole bunch of usernames
and passwords, maybe online, maybe in
some database that they or someone else
attacked and posted for the whole world
to download. Credential stuffing means
not using dictionaries, not using brute
force, but just literally using a list
of already known usernames and
passwords, maybe from some other
application or website to try to stuff
them into a different website to see if
well maybe if David's using this
username and password over here with
high probability he's probably using the
same username and password over here. So
credential stuffing is the threat that I
dare say many of you are vulnerable to.
Now, you don't need to raise your hands
and admit to this right now, but if you
are using the same username and the same
password on two websites, three
websites, 30 websites, all websites, you
are today vulnerable to this attack. To
be clear, if any one of those websites
or apps is compromised by some adversary
and they figure out all of the usernames
and passwords on that system, what a
smart adversary is going to do now is to
try that same username and password they
found for you on Amazon, on Gmail, on
any other website or app that you with
high probability might be using just
because those services are popular. So
what's the takeaway? Ideally, if you
want to be immune to this kind of
credential stuffing attack where someone
takes your credentials over here and
tries to stuff them into these other
services over here, you have to use
different credentials on each and every
website on each and every app. You
cannot should not be reusing the same
password on multiple websites or apps.
Username, yes, especially if it's your
email address, but passwords, no. Now,
this is admittedly easier said than
done. So, we'll see soon how we can try
to achieve this avoiding credential
stuffing by having unique passwords by
at least having some help when it comes
to managing the same. But there's
another attack too that's come up
indirectly here already known as social
engineering. Social engineering isn't a
technical attack per se, but rather a
social one, an attack among humans. For
instance, let me go ahead and suggest
the following. If you have a piece of
paper near you um and a pen or pencil,
go ahead and write down if you could on
that piece of paper um one of your
passwords. Any of them is fine. Just go
ahead on this piece of paper in front of
you and write down one of your passwords
including any letters or digits or
punctuation.
Now, I'm seeing in the chat some
resistance. I'm seeing some heads down
though and some scribbling which is
exactly the point. Why would you take my
suggestion and write down your password
on a piece of paper even though I'm
presumably someone you should trust in a
cyber security class. Those of you who
reached for a pen or pencil, just wrote
down one of your passwords on a sheet of
paper were just socially engineered
because a circumstance was created where
you believed or trusted the person that
was asking or telling you to do
something and you took at face value
that you should do that thing. Moving
forward, if any teacher ever asks you to
write down a password on a piece of
paper, one takeaway for today is just
don't do it. That would be social
engineering. And in general, if someone
calls you on the phone, sends you an
email, and tries to get information from
you, even if it seems and sounds
legitimate, moving forward after today
especially, you should always have a
healthy skepticism, if not just enough
paranoia to be healthy in the interest
of protecting your account. Moving
forward, if you had someone ask you
something like that, or even a little
more nefarious, trying to figure out
what your first pet was or something
should kind of ra perk your ears up.
Your Spidey senses should go up, so to
speak, in the context of Spider-Man. And
you should wonder, wait a minute, why do
they need that information? Let me see
how this plays out before I share
anything about myself. And indeed, if
you were, bless your hearts, but if you
did, jot down your password with a pen
or pencil. Remember that feeling of
being duped because you do not want that
to happen when it actually matters. Now,
after this, now I know you'll believe
nothing I say, but go shred or tear up
or flush whatever piece of paper has
that password on it. The point is not to
share it with anyone just to prove that
particular point. Now, beyond social
engineering, there's another threat
that's a variant of that, but is more
technical in nature, and that is
fishing. And most of you probably have
heard about fishing in this context. And
you can think about it sort of
physically like going fishing but trying
to hook a sucker, someone like me or you
who is duped into providing information
that they shouldn't. And this very often
happens via emails. Odds are if you go
through your spam folder sometime you
will see emails that seem to be coming
from paypal.com or seem to be coming
from Google or maybe a politician or the
like. And very often those emails are
encouraging you to click a link and
maybe make a donation. Click a link,
maybe change your password, click a link
and verify your information. Fishing is
all about trying to use social
engineering, in this case in a technical
way to try to convince you through very
convincing looking emails and even
websites that it is a legitimate email
from paypal.com or it is a legitimate
email from a politician or it is a
legitimate email or request from a
teacher here at Harvard, but it's not.
What they're trying to do, the
adversaries in this case are prey on
your trust for those certain companies
or persons. They're trying to prey on
your comfort with familiar user
interfaces, things that you've seen
before. But unfortunately, it's all too
easy for an adversary to make a very
official looking email, to make a very
legitimate looking website, even one
that looks identical to paypal.com,
identical to Gmail or other services.
And frankly, if you take some of CS50's
other courses, kind of boils down to
copy and paste in the simplest of
scenarios, just copying and pasting some
legitimate website and pretending that
you own it, too. So, how might fishing
manifest itself in the real world? Well,
consider one of those social media posts
online that tend to invite you to
comment with your favorite song from
childhood. Sometimes those posts have
like a million responses from people you
know and don't even know. But more than
being interested in what your childhood
favorite song was, those posts are very
often fishing for personal information.
Because suppose that you or at least
someone among those comments is actually
using their favorite childhood song as
their answer to some website or at
secret question. Now the author of that
post, not to mention everyone else,
knows the answer to the same. So how
else might fishing manifest itself in
the real world? If you were to visit a
screen later today that looks a little
something like this. Well, this looks
like Gmail's login page, at least here
in the US when using English, and
frankly, I've seen this so many times
that I might be inclined to just blindly
type into the form my email address and
then after that probably my password.
But it's important to begin to develop
an intuition for a suspicion for when
and when these sites might not be
legitimate. How might you do that? Well,
you should minimally be looking at the
URL bar and making sure that it is
gmail.com or probably google.com or
whatever google.country code depending
on where you live in the world. Making
sure that it looks legitimate and that
you've actually been there before. When
you hover over links, you can very
commonly in your browser look at the
bottom lefthand corner or some corner of
your screen and you can see what URL a
link will actually take you to. Even
though the words on the screen might say
something, the actual link might take
you somewhere else. Now, even then, it's
hard sometimes to discern these kinds of
things, but these are just best
practices. You don't need to do uh you
don't need to be so worried that you
don't go anywhere on the internet, but
you should learn to keep an eye out for
these kinds of things. And in general
with fishing, rather than trust any link
in an email that you receive, especially
when it's something private, like a bank
account, something medical, something
personal, well, that's fine. open a new
tab and manually go to paypal.com enter
or manually go to gmail.com enter. Don't
just blindly trust these links. Now,
here again, we see a trade-off between
usability and security. It's a little
annoying if I can't just click on a link
and go to the place I want to go. You
have to manually open the page, type it
in manually, and so forth. But again, it
depends on what's now more important to
you, the usability of that service or
the security of your account therein.
This is even worse when it come this is
even um more worrisome when it comes to
two-step verification and Google takes
some liberties with the wording here.
This is usually best described as
two-factor authentication. But again,
the most sophisticated of adversaries,
theoretically, if they sent you a
fishing email, tricked you into a
visiting a website that looks like Gmail
but is not Gmail, they could
theoretically even prompt you for a
two-factor code like this. And then if
they're smart and savvy enough with
code, they could automatically now send
your username, your password, and a
two-factor code maybe to the real
gmail.com, log into your account, change
your password before you even get up and
running therein. It's a more
sophisticated threat and it's not
something you need to worry about as
much. But it's this principle of not
just trusting screens and requests that
are presented in front of you. You
should have this healthy skepticism and
at least some technical savvy to know
how you can decide for yourself. Yes, I
am comfortable with proceeding with this
step. Now, there's another type of
attack, too, that's more sophisticated
and not one you need to worry about as
frequently as some of the earlier ones,
but they're generally known as a
machineinthe-middle attack, whereby if
you're on the internet, there are,
suffice it to say, many other machines
on the internet very often between you
and whatever website or app you are
visiting. Often those machines might be
things like routers, uh, servers that
internet service providers, companies,
universities, maybe even your own home
owns and controls, but all of your data
is passing through those machines in the
middle, so to speak. If any of them are
malicious and are maybe storing your
data, looking at your data, it's
possible that you might not be having
secure communications with the other end
unless you are using certain defenses.
And in our focus in this class on data,
we'll talk about cryptography and
encryption and building blocks via which
we can mitigate attacks like these. But
it's worth knowing about this general
idea that even though it feels like it's
only you and Amazon.com, it's only you
and PayPal.com, it's only you and
WhatsApp, there are many other machines
in the middle. And if you're not using
the best practices and if you're not
keeping an eye out for those things
suspicious, those machines in the middle
might actually be there to attack you,
to take your data, to change your uh to
access your accounts or something more
as well.
So, there's a lot of attacks out there
and at this point you might be feeling a
bit defeated, but hopefully we've
presented at least enough defenses thus
far and there are still a few more to
come. But let's consider now kind of the
source of a lot of these problems.
Unfortunately, it's you and it's me.
Like the whole story here today started
with you and I are not very good at
choosing passwords and we generally like
you know meet the minimal requirements,
not necessarily the best practices. But
again, there's these sociological side
effects of certain corporate policies or
technical policies that do induce this
trade-off between security and
usability. And it's one thing for me to
preach here, so to speak, and say, ""Yes,
you should use long, complicated
passwords that are really hard to guess
with uh uh letters and digits and
punctuation still, maybe even 64
characters if you run want to be really
secure, even if it's a longer phrase.
But honestly, there are also these
pressures on me not doing that. It's
annoying to type in 64 characters. It's
annoying to type in eight characters if
a lot of them require uppercase,
lowercase, punctuation, and the like.
And honestly, I have dozens. I have
hundreds, maybe thousands of accounts
nowadays on the internet that have
accumulated over time. What am I going
to do if it just gets difficult to
remember these things? Well, like
someone you might you yourself might
know in your company, you might walk by
their desk and see on their monitor the
familiar yellow post-it note with one or
more of their passwords actually on it.
Maybe worse, you open their desk drawer
and there's a whole print out of all of
their username and passwords. or even
beyond that, maybe they actually have a
text file or an Excel file, a CSV file
on their computer, thinking, ""Well, at
least it's all digital, but it's just
sitting there on their desktop."" And
worse, maybe it's called passwords.txt
or the like. But that's a very real side
effect of having policies and technical
constraints that make it harder to use
systems. So, what are some other
defenses that either you can use or
maybe companies can use or offer to make
things better? Well, a solution to some
of these problems might be this single
sign on or SSO. So, single sign on
refers to an ability to sign up for to
log into one website using an account
that you already have on another
website. And very often the account that
you use is one of the big ones, one of
the popular websites or applications out
there. So for instance, if you want log
into this representative website here,
what you might see is yes, a form field
via which you can type in your own email
address and your password to log in. Or
if you prefer, you can just log in with
Google or you can just log in with
Facebook or you can just log in with any
number of other services if this website
or application supports it. Now, what's
the motivation here? Well, one, it's
still backwards compatible, so to speak,
with the very familiar approach of just
let me register with my own email
address, let me come up with my own
password and be done with it, especially
if I don't use Google or Facebook as a
customer. But the upside of offering
these solutions, especially for popular
websites like Google and Facebook and
others, is that if I already have an
account with Google or Facebook, and
hopefully I already have a good password
for both of those because those are
important to me. And better yet, I
ideally have two-factor authentication
enabled on one or both of those because
again, they're important accounts to me.
Wouldn't it be nice for this new website
to let me one just log in with my
existing account so that I don't have to
waste time signing up for yet another
internet account, two I don't have to
remember a new password that's going to
be difficult to remember and so forth.
And so it decreases friction, it
increases usability of the system and
ideally it increases the security of the
system in this case as well. Why?
Because if you're doing a good job
protecting at least these most important
personal accounts, then this website
stands to benefit from those same best
practices on your part. Now, what is
actually happening here? When you click
login with Google, login with Facebook,
you should see the Google login screen
or the Facebook login screen
respectively. You should literally be
redirected in your browser to google.com
or facebook.com or one of their
international domain names instead.
there you'll type in your same username
and password as usual for Google or
Facebook but that password is not given
to this new website or this third-party
website you're visiting rather using a
technique known as cryptography and
encryption and some fancy math
essentially the username with which you
log in is sent back to this third party
website but not your password just a
confirmation that yes David successfully
logged into Google or David successfully
logged into Facebook. Therefore, you can
trust that his username is
mailin@harvard.edu
or whatever it is I typed in to log in
there. So, using single sign on benefits
not only you potentially but also the
website or application by making it
easier for you to register andor log in
subsequently as well. Now, where does
this leave us ultimately? Some of you
might already be thinking, well, what
about using a password manager? And some
of you might be thinking, what is a
password manager? So, let's emphasize
this one perhaps the most. Increasingly,
best practice is to use a piece of
software that manages your passwords for
you. Thankfully, there's going to be an
even better solution than this on the
horizon. But for now, minimally, if
you're not using a password manager, you
probably should be. If you're using the
same password on multiple sites or
applications and thus you're vulnerable
to credential stuffing, you should
probably be using a password manager
instead so that you can change all of
those accounts to have unique passwords.
But this piece of software known as a
password manager can remember those
passwords for you. If you are in the
habit of choosing very easy passwords
because it's just better for you to
remember, you should probably start
using a password manager because beyond
remembering your passwords, these
password managers also make it easy to
generate new passwords. You click a
button and essentially it will generate
a password that's however short or long
that you want with some uppercase,
lowercase symbols, numbers, whatever it
is a website requires, it will just
generate it for you. And better yet, it
will then save that generated password
for you. So you the human do not need to
memorize it and you the human certainly
don't need to write it down on a post-it
note or any other file somewhere else.
So password managers literally do just
that and they have even more features
than that. Generally if you're using a
password manager and you go visit a
website for the second time or the third
time. You can typically hit an automatic
keystroke that will just automatically
log you in. It will fill in your
username and your password. But better
yet, it will only do so if you're on the
real gmail.com or the real Facebook.com
or the real PayPal.com. These password
managers also remember the URL at which
you created or last used that username
and password so that if you are somehow
subject to a a fishing attack, you've
been tricked into clicking a link and
going to a website that looks like
Google, looks like Facebook, but
actually isn't, the password manager
will ignore your keystrokes and not
actually log you in, pasting into that
form your actual username and password
because it doesn't recognize that same
URL. So there are a lot of upsides of
these password managers. The one catch
is that the onus is on you to remember
one primary password that protects your
password manager itself. That is to say,
if this is a piece of software that
stores all of the dozens, hundreds,
thousands of usernames and passwords
that you have, you are putting
proverbally all of your eggs in one
basket, so to speak. that is you want to
protect this password manager with
probably the best password you've ever
come up with. This should probably be
long. It should have some complexity. It
should be a little annoying perhaps to
type in because you don't want an
adversary to get in and get access to
everything else, but it's just one
password that we're really asking you to
pick really well and reasonably long so
that you're protecting everything else.
Now, these password managers are a
little different than what you're
probably familiar with in your own
browser. It's been common for years for
browsers to remember your username and
password by just showing you like
bullets like dot dot dot in the form
field. So, you can just hit enter.
That's fine, but that information is
often associated only with that one
browser. It doesn't propagate to your
phone or another device that you're
logged into. It's not easy to share it
with someone else if you have a family
account, for instance, or something like
that. So, password managers often offer
additional features beyond that and
really protect all of the things that
you're using and also help you generate
those same passwords. Fortunately,
thankfully nowadays, these are
increasingly standard. There are
third-party options that you can uh find
online or even purchase, but there are
increasingly built into our own
operating systems, which if I had to
choose, especially for a less technical
audience, using what comes with your
computer from the major manufacturers,
is probably a good thing as opposed to
going third party, unless third parties
offer you additional features that might
be especially beneficial in companies
and families or the like. So, Apple has
what they call their iCloud keychain via
which you can not only save passwords on
one device. They can propagate securely
to your other device like your phone.
Google has its password manager,
Microsoft has its credential manager,
and there's certainly other options as
well. The takeaway for today though
should be that if you're not using a
password manager, it's probably time to
start doing so at least for your most
important accounts. maybe things that
are particularly personal, medical,
financial, anything where you or your
family would really be upset if that
account were somehow compromised. At
least figure out how to start migrating
those kinds of accounts to a password
manager and also enable some of our
other best practices like two-factor
authentication. Better yet, don't just
enable two-factor authentication. Don't
use SMS if you can. instead use like a
native application on your phone or even
a physical key fob just to decrease the
probability of those threats. And I
would encourage you to because it's one
thing to sit in on a class like this and
be like, ""Oh yeah, I should do that.""
But then it just feels like so much work
to go and change all hundreds or
thousands of my accounts. Again, take
baby steps. Bite off the easiest, most
important accounts first. And over time,
the next time you log into that other
website, okay, go ahead and change the
password to something better. put it in
the password manager and be done with
it. The next time you go to another
website, do it that one. You can do
these things incrementally because again
with this advice, I'm just trying to
help you personally strike this balance
between usability and security because
if your takeaway is I have to go change
a thousand passwords tonight, you might
not realistically do it. So better would
be to change a few of them and chip away
at this problem over time. Let me pause
here and see if there are any questions.
If a password manager and 2FA is so
helpful, so why we are using antivirus
for websites?
>> Oh, so you should certainly be using
antivirus for other reasons that we'll
talk about in another class. Viruses,
worms, and malware can do any number of
bad things including encrypting your
data, deleting your data, sending spam
from your computer. There's many reasons
you want to run it instead. However, if
you have malware like a virus on your
computer and it's logging all of your
keystrokes, theoretically, you could
still be vulnerable to attack if they
are also uh logging your two-factor
code, maybe because you get distracted,
you don't hit enter fast enough, and
they can use that too. It's a lower
probability threat. It's a theoretical
one, but also in the interest of best
practices, you don't want any software
on your computer that could be doing bad
things anyway. You just want to raise
the bar as much as you can to these
adversaries without making your own
accounts unusable.
Uh, another question.
>> Oh yeah, I had a question about social
engineering if that's fine. And we know
that the rise of the AI technology, you
know, now AI can record your voice and
sample it and that could be a real
threat in social engineering because now
someone can mimic your boss and call you
or someone can mimic your voice and call
your bank. So, is there a way to combat
this or just is there any technology to
prevent this from happening?
>> That's a really good question and
another piece of advice I should reflect
back. If on any of your accounts,
particularly bank accounts, you are
using voice recognition technology
whereby when you set up the account, you
were prompted to say a phrase into the
phone. For instance, to evoke an old
movie called Sneakers, my voice is my
password. you should disable those
features and stop using them assuming
there's an alternative like two-factor
authentication whereby they send you a
push notification to an app or the like.
The reason being exactly that is you've
probably seen in this age of AI there
are technologies called deep fakes
whereby you can generate video but also
audio of people. This is very commonly
done for celebrities, for politicians
and voices that you see a lot on the
internet. But it would not be that hard
if someone has access to voice
recordings of you to use some software
or some app to generate you saying my
voice is my password even though you
might not have said that in since the
time you set up the account. And so your
accounts too might be compromised. So my
own advice there would be don't use
voice-based recognition anymore. um if
if there is a better alternative
available.
Other questions?
>> Doesn't having one password manager, so
figuratively keeping all your keys in
one safe defeat the purpose of having
different passwords because if you lose
that one key to your uh key safe, all is
gone.
>> It's a really good intuition and that's
exactly the trade-off to think about. I
would consider in deciding for yourself
if you want to take that advice what the
alternative is because if you're using
pretty easy to guess passwords
everywhere like this is probably a net
positive to move to a password manager
instead. If you're reusing the same
password on a lot of websites and apps
this is probably a net positive
to switch to a password manager instead.
If however though you've actually been a
very good internet citizen and you've
been choosing hard to guess unique
passwords for all different sites,
they're not written down on a post-it or
easily accessible, then this might be a
net negative for you to put all of those
eggs, so to speak, in one basket,
thereby making them more vulnerable. I
from experience and from sort of the
head nods and admissions that we get
from students over the years, I guess
that most of us in this room would
benefit as a net positive from a
password manager. But there too, you
should decide for yourself. And again,
one of our lessons for today is don't
just believe something some guy on the
internet told you. Um, decide for
yourself based on these trade-offs,
these upsides and downsides. Now,
password managers are not all upside.
Indeed, if you lose or forget that
primary password, you might lose access
to all of your other accounts.
Fortunately, there is an alternative
that's increasingly available on
websites and apps known as pass keys.
And what's nice about pass keys is that
moving forward, it will be your Mac,
your PC or your phone that generates a
pass key for a new website or app for
which you're registering. You yourself
don't have to remember what that pass
key is. And indeed, it isn't even just
one value. Rather, it's a pair of
values, a private value and a public
value that have a mathematical
relationship between the two. And those
two values are used the next time you
try to access that website or
application. Your Mac, your PC or your
phone will use those values to
automatically authenticate you
thereafter. And better yet, those values
are synchronized as needed across your
devices so that you can use your Mac and
your PC and your phone or any other such
devices to authenticate. But to better
understand these pass keys, we'll need
to know a little something about the
world of cryptography. And so for that,
we'll wait for our discussion of
securing your data. So, more on that
next time.
[music]
All right, this is CS50's introduction
to cyber security. My name is David Men
and this week we'll focus on securing
data. Last week recall we focused on
accounts and particularly one of the
mechanisms via we protect our accounts
is generally by no by way of these
things called passwords. But we focused
last time really on our having the
responsibility to keep these things
secure. And yet there's another party
involved whenever you have an account
with a username and a password and
that's the server or app that is
actually storing that password in some
form long form long term so that you can
actually authenticate yourself that is
proved to this application or website
that you are who you claim to be. Well
in the simplest form perhaps these
servers that are storing our usernames
and passwords for which we have
registered are maybe doing something
very simple like this. For instance, if
a website or app has two users at the
moment at least, Alice and Bob, and
suppose for simplicity that Alice's
password is Apple, and Bob's password is
banana, you could imagine that website
or that app simply storing in like a
very simple text file um these key value
pairs. Username colon password, new
line, username, colon, password, new
line. And in fact, that's actually very
commonly how passwords are stored on
systems, at least certain operating
systems like Linux. Not necessarily as
simply as this. They often have a little
more information off to the right there.
But in essence, it's the username and
password. But this wouldn't be a good
thing to store the passwords exactly
like this. Why? Well, suppose that this
website or this app and its database are
somehow hacked by an adversary. That is,
someone gains access to that file
containing these usernames and
passwords. Well, at that point, they
literally have everyone's username and
password. And we talked last time about
attacks like credential stuffing whereby
an adversary once they know your
username and password on one system,
they can try stuffing that username and
password into other systems, other
websites, other apps just in hopes that
you are unfortunately using the same
username and password elsewhere as well.
So, this is generally not a good thing
if an adversary gets access to
everyone's usernames and passwords. And
even though of course in an ideal world
that would never happen, we should
probably as the administrators, as the
creators of this website or app, we
should probably do everything we can to
at least minimize the fallout, the
downsides, the damages that might result
if, and dare say when our database or
this text file here are somehow
compromised. So how might we go about
doing that here? Rather than just
storing apple and banana in clear text,
so to speak, literally in the English
words themselves, why don't we go ahead
and employ a technique known as hashing?
Now, if you've studied computer science
before, you might actually know this
phrase in the context of hash tables and
data structures. Well, it turns out the
idea in this world of securing data is
very similar. And in fact, this is a
technique that's incredibly common for
solving all sorts of problems. Well,
what do we mean by hashing in this
context? Hashing is the process of
taking a password as input and somehow
converting it to a so-called hash or
hash value. Now, these hash values don't
look like English. They're typically
strings of text that might have letters,
might have numbers, but they're
generally of some fixed length
typically. And in this case here when we
go about taking our password as input
converting it somehow via an algorithm
or circum some code that we wrote we
want to convert it into this hash value
and then store that hash value in that
database of passwords instead. So here's
a proverbial black box and let's
stipulate for the moment that I have no
idea how hashing works but I do know
that this box can do it. So how do I
think about this process? Well generally
speaking there's going to be some input
to this box. Ultimately I want to get
some output from that box. And what this
box really represents is in fact a hash
function. You can think of this as a
device like some kind of machine. You
can think of it like a program, some
piece of software. Or you can even think
about it as a mathematical function that
operates simply on numbers coming in as
input. In fact, if you're mathematically
inclined, though we won't use this
syntax often, you can think of that hash
function as being represented by f. You
can think of the input as being
represented by X and you can think of
the output of this process as being
so-called f ofx. If not familiar with
that notation, that's fine. But this is
directly connected hashing to basic
mathematics as well that you might
encounter before long. But what we care
about is passing into this black box a
password and getting out a hash and then
storing that hash and not the password
in our database or text file of
usernames and passwords. So how might we
go about doing this? Well, if I were to
provide apple as an input to this hash
function, let's think about the simplest
hash function possible that doesn't
output apple, but some representation of
apple that I can eventually store in
that database. So, I'm going to propose
very simply that maybe the simplest hash
function we can come up with and indeed
if you've studied computer science or
taking CS50 itself, you might recall
that we can hash our inputs unlike
specific letters therein. So, apple
starts with a. So, you know what? A is
the first letter of the English
alphabet. So, I'm going to create a hash
function here pictorially that outputs
one whenever the input happens to start
with an A, as does apple. Meanwhile, if
we pass in banana, I'm going to have
this hash function output two because B
is the second letter of the English
alphabet. And dot dot dot, we might get
to cherry or other passwords as well.
That might output three and beyond. And
you could imagine doing this for all
letters of the English alphabet. Now,
unfortunately, this isn't the best hash
function because it's fairly simplistic.
And in fact, I can quickly think of some
other fruits like avocados that also
start with a and that would give me the
same hash value. And that's actually a
characteristic we'll come back to
whereby when you hash values, there can
actually be ambiguities potentially
whereby two inputs might actually have
the same output. And we'll consider
eventually what the implications of that
might be. But for now, I dare say that's
a little too simplistic. And what might
be better than outputting one or two or
three is a little something more cryptic
because that's just too helpful. That's
too much of a hint. If I see that your
hash value is one, I at least know that
your password now clearly starts with an
A, which means at best I can do 126 the
amount of work to figure out what it
actually is. So we want these hashes
generally to be a little weird looking
and really unguessable and not leak any
information. So for instance, a very
common older hash function for Apple
might actually output this dot dot ek wx
a83 dh i a with some mixed uppercase and
lowercase letters therein. Now it looks
weird. You probably can't and shouldn't
see any kind of pattern in there. There
is a fancy math formula that took as
input apple and outputed as its hash
value that string of text there, but in
and of itself, it doesn't really leak
any information like the number one or
two or three would. So, we've already
made an improvement. Banana, meanwhile,
would look like this. And cherry,
meanwhile, would look like that. So,
notice that these values are indeed
quite different. So using this better
hash function I claim that doesn't just
look at the first letter of the alphabet
but looks at maybe all of the letters in
the input C h E R R Y in this case we
can probably come up with something more
interesting more cryptic looking if you
will like the values we've just seen. So
let me propose now that what we should
do in our database of passwords is not
store Alice Apple Bob banana but let's
instead store the hashes of apple and
banana respectively. So instead in this
password database, I'm going to store
this instead. The exact same values that
we just saw coming as outputs from that
black box. But in this case, now I'm
storing in my database of passwords,
usernames, and hash values.
Now, why is this perhaps a good thing?
Well, one, if someone now attacks this
server and somehow gains access to all
of these usernames and hashes, what they
don't have is an entire list of
passwords. So they can't quite as easily
go about credential stuffing and
figuring out maybe if this database will
give me access to my accounts somewhere
else. I'm at least creating some work
for the adversary. But at the same time,
I feel like I've kind of broken the
whole system because previously
presumably when you log into a website
or app and you type in your username and
then you type in your password, what
does the website or app probably do?
Well, once that username and password
are sent over the internet typically to
that server, well, the server probably
compares what you typed in against the
username in their database or their text
file. And the server compares what you
typed in as your password against
whatever password is in their database.
But now we have a problem. We have you
typing the username, and we do have the
username still in the database. Case in
point, Alice and Bob are still here. But
what we don't have is apple and banana.
We've replaced those all together with
hashes. So even if you type in or Alice
types in apple, well, we don't want to
compare a PLE to this because it
obviously doesn't match. And Bob's
banana, we don't want to compare against
this because it's not going to match and
so forth. So what can we do? Well, the
way authentication typically works on
the server side when using hashing is as
follows. When you first create an
account or register for this website or
app, you type in if you're Alice, Alice,
enter, and then Apple for instance,
enter. That username Alice, that
password Apple are sent to the server.
But what the server does before saving
the username and password is it runs
that hash function on Alice's password
which is Apple. Converts it thereafter
to this value and stores Alice's
username and the hash of Alice's
password only and throws away Apple. It
deletes it. It forgets it in memory.
What then happens next? Well, the next
time Alice tries to log into this
website, maybe the next day, a week from
then, a year from then, for the second
or third or more time, what happens?
Well, Alice types in Alice as her
username. Hopefully, Apple as her
password, hits enter. Those get sent to
the server as usual. And obviously, the
server can't just compare username
against username and password against
password because it doesn't have the
password in its database. So, what can
the server do? The server can repeat the
very same process, taking Alice's
password as inputed, a PLE, run it
through the exact same hash function a
day, a week, a year later, and then
compare that resulting hash value to
whatever is stored in this text file or
database. And now, admittedly, we're
creating a whole lot more work for
ourselves, but it's not that big a deal
because this is just a math function. or
if you know how to program, it's just a
few lines of code that you've written in
software that converts passwords to hash
values. And honestly, nowadays, you
wouldn't even be rewriting most of this
code yourself. You'd be using a library,
third-party code that someone else
smarter than you maybe has written and
gotten it just right, no bugs or
mistakes. So, you're just relying on
someone else's code anyway to achieve
this goal. But the upside now to be
clear is if this file is compromised
somehow the server is hacked into and
this data is leaked at least they only
know the usernames on your system not
the actual passwords.
Let me pause here and see if there's any
questions on this technique of hashing
for passwords specifically.
you said yourself uh we are using
libraries more often than write the hash
uh functions ourselves
um if we are not taking the course on
CS50 um
so then it's easy to hack this hashes
right because we can go through 10 50 I
don't know hash functions that are
available in the libraries and then you
can reverse the hash um results is that
right
>> almost you can do exactly what you
described first whereby you use the same
library, the same code to create hash
values to then compare those against
what's in the database. But generally
these hashes are not reversible per se.
You can compare them, but you can't
reverse the process for reasons we'll
come back to. But your intuition is
right. And so really the takeaway here
is that we haven't made our system
absolutely secure. We've made it
relatively more secure. Why? because
we've increased the cost to the
adversary, to the hacker. They now have
to do more work to figure out what the
actual passwords are if they want to
benefit from this hack. So again, it
just raises the bar. It does not keep
the adversary necessarily out or even
stop them from figuring out one person's
password, but it might take them a lot
more time. It might take them a lot more
resources like server or cloud costs or
money or it might even heighten the risk
before they actually are successful. How
about one other question here on
hashing?
>> If the if uh the password is intercepted
before after after the website is hacked
and the password is intercepted before
it's uh encrypted. So wouldn't that pose
a problem?
>> Yes, absolutely. Uh then all bets are
off everything we just discussed is not
useful at all if the adversary has
actually intercepted the password before
it has even been hashed. Now thankfully
there's going to be solutions to that
problem too and we'll come to them today
but for now focusing only on hashes it
solves one problem but not all. In fact
it turns out that those attacks we
talked about last time with respect to
our accounts are still possible. You can
still use a dictionary for instance of
English words or better yet a dictionary
of English fruits and you could one
fruit at a time run each of those values
as input into the same hash function the
library or code that you're using to
achieve this and then that's going to
give you one hash value after another
and you could compare each of those hash
values against whatever is in the
database or the file of passwords that
you the hacker in the story might have
actually stolen somehow. You have to do
more work though because it's no longer
as simple as just comparing apple
against apple and banana against banana.
You actually have to do some work. You
have to do some computational work. And
if the file is only a few values, of
course, not a big deal. If it's
thousands or millions of rows, it might
actually take a lot more time, energy,
and effort. So again, we're just raising
the bar, but not keeping the adversary
out altogether. And even if you don't
have a dictionary available and even if
the passwords are not all fruits in
English, well, you can still as the
adversary re resort to brute force
attacks and you can try even the
simplest of passwords like 000000
or maybe eight zeros instead. And you
can hash that and see what the resulting
hash value is and compare that against
what's in the database. Then you could
try 000000
00001
hash that compare that against what's in
the database and then move on to the
next and the next. Doing this not just
for numbers but for letters as well. A a
a aaa
hash that and compare. Eventually apple
will be on that list. Eventually banana
will be on that list. But there too the
brute force attack is still going to
take some amount of time. So it's just
increasing the cost or the complexity
for the adversary in this particular
case. But there's yet another threat
that's possible in the context now of
hasht the hashes which is worth knowing
about. There's a term of art known as a
rainbow table which is a very beautiful
way of saying that adversaries in
advance might have already hashed all
possible English words in a dictionary.
adversaries might have already hashed
all possible passwords of length four or
five or six or seven or eight or
something else. And maybe if they have a
big enough hard drive, they are storing
a big table like an Excel file or a CSV
file of all of the words that they've
tried, all of the passwords they've
tried and all of the hash values they've
already computed. Then it's even easier.
Then they don't even need to do a brute
force attack per se, hashing and hashing
and hashing and hashing. Then they can
just compare, compare, compare because
indeed a rainbow table simply contains
all of the passwords they've tried, all
of the hash values they've generated.
And so they just compare left to right
whatever the user typed in against the
hash value they've already computed. Now
for certain hash functions, this threat
of a rainbow table is just not feasible.
You might need terabytes or pabytes of
data, which means a lot of hard drives
and a lot of money. So there are
potential downward pressures on this
kind of an attack, but it can certainly
speed things up. Certainly if you're
precomputing that is pre-calculating
some of the hashes for at least words in
an English dictionary and certainly some
short list like all of the fruits in the
world. But there's another problem that
we might encounter on the server with
regard to our passwords. Alice might
have a password of apple. Bob might have
a password of banana. But suppose that
both Carol and Charlie have a password
of Cherry. And just by coincidence, they
both chose the same password and are in
this same database. Now, we've already
concluded, I think, that we definitely
don't want to store the plain text
passwords. We don't want to store
literally in the clear apple, banana,
cherry, and cherry because it's just too
easy for the adversary to do bad things
with it. So, we at least want to hash
this. But here's where hashing can kind
of leak information, so to speak. If I
go ahead and use the same function I've
been using to hash apple and banana and
now cherry, what do you notice about
Carol's and Charlie's hash values?
Curiously, but maybe not surprisingly,
they're exactly the same. That's after
all how functions typically work. Be it
in math or in software, in code, if you
pass the exact same input, unless
there's some randomness going on, you're
going to get the same output again and
again. Now, why is this a big deal?
Well, if some adversary attacks this
database and gains access to all of
these p these usernames and hashes, we
have leaked information in the sense
that the adversary just by glancing at
this file knows that okay, I don't know
what Carol's password is or what
Charlie's password is, but I know it's
the same password. And that alone might
be enough information to figure out with
higher probability what it is. Maybe
Carol and Charlie are related. So maybe
you focus on words or numbers that are
common to both of them. Maybe there's
some information that's implied by this.
If they both are in that they both like
the same TV shows, they both like the
same movies. You can try to find in your
mind maybe the intersection of
information that might lead you with
higher probability to figure out without
brute force even what Carol's password
is and Charlie's password is. So this is
a common problem and we only have four
users in this database. You can imagine
having many more. Odds are some of us
are going to have the same username. Not
the same username, some of us are going
to have the same passwords. In fact,
without raising your hands or admitting
to this for the whole world to see, do
any of you have a password of 1 2 3 4 in
some website or app, maybe a little
harder. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8. You know,
something very simple like this. Maybe
it's an account you don't really care
about. Well, that's a perfect example of
where if you have an account on the same
system as someone else here in the
classroom, you're going to have in that
database presumably the same hash values
and that might be alone enough
information to leak um and increase the
probability that you and not Alice or
Bob are actually compromised with
respect to your account. So, how can we
fix this? Well, it turns out there's
another technique in the world of data
that we can use to perturb this process.
And you can think of it metaphorically
as like sprinkling a little bit of salt
on the hash function so as to change
what its output is. It's not random per
se, but you are perturbing the output so
that it's much less likely that two
people with the same passwords are going
to have the same hash value. So how does
this work? In this case before when we
passed in cherry as our input, we got
the same hash again and again. But let
me propose that we modify our hash
function to take two inputs. Now, not
just a password, but also a salt value,
so to speak. A little bit of a
sprinkling of, in this case, just two
characters, two numbers, two letters, or
a combination thereof. Now, this hash
function that I'm describing is still
going to output a hash value. But notice
it's different from the one before. And
even if you don't quite remember what it
was before, it was not this. But worth
noting is that in the output of this
hash function now is the salt itself. So
the salt isn't something that's meant to
be private or secret or secure. It's
just sprinkled in there to make sure
that whatever hash value comes out of
this black box is a little bit different
than if you had put a different salt
value instead. So for instance, suppose
that for Carol and for Charlie we use
different salts and that's the idea.
Different users should have different
salt values just in case they choose the
same passwords. So instead of 50 in
Cherry, suppose that Charlie uses a salt
value of say 49. 49 is not a number that
Charlie or you or me have to pick. This
is all done by the server automatically
picking a random two characters like 49
or 50. But notice what just happened. If
I rewind to cherry with a salt of five,
this was the hash value. The first two
characters of which are the salt. If
though I change the salt from 50 to 49,
the hash changes completely and it
prefixes it with now 49 instead of 50.
This ensures that even if Carol and
Charlie have the exact same password,
there's no way I, the adversary, am
going to know by looking at it because
indeed what ends up in the file now are
these two values. One is prefixed with
50, one is prefixed with 49. The rest of
the hash values clearly are completely
different. So again, the upside is this
approach where the hash function takes
two inputs, the password and assault and
then outputs one hash value means that
we're not leaking information except
except there is a corner case. If by
chance, by bad luck, the system chooses
the same salt for both Carol and
Charlie, yes, there might still be
information leaked. And honestly, that
may very well happen. If you've got
thousands, millions of users, then
you're going to run out of two character
possibilities. You're going to have to
reuse salt. But the idea is that we're
just trying to put downward pressure on
the probability of being attacked
successfully. We're trying to
equivalently raise the bar to the
adversary so that they are not as likely
to gain access to my data or in turn my
account. questions now on salting or
hashing itself.
>> Oh, I'm curious. Uh, where do we store
the salt?
>> So, where do you store the salt? The
salt is actually stored in the hash
value itself according to this algorithm
in the first two characters. And the
value of storing the salt in the first
two characters of the hash is as
follows. The next time Carol logs in,
she types in her username, Carol, and
hits enter. The server now knows, okay,
I'm expecting a password from Carol.
Let's see what she types in. Suppose
that she types in correctly. Cherry.
Now, the system is not storing Cherry.
So, it's not going to compare literally
what Carol typed in. But it is going to
hash Cherry. But first, the system's
going to check what is Carol's hash,
what is Carol's salt, and it's going to
infer as much by looking at Carol's hash
value and looking only at the first two
characters by convention. Then what the
server is going to do, it's going to
take whatever Carol typed in, cherry, ch
r y, it's going to pass in 50,
and then hopefully it's going to get
back this same value here, this whole
string in yellow. And if those are
correct, then the carol will be
considered authenticated. By contrast,
if the username happens to be Charlie
and Charlie hits enter, then what the
server is going to do is look at
Charlie's hash value, grab the first two
characters for Charlie's salt, use that
salt and cherry as the input to the hash
function, and hope that the result is
Charlie's value, not Carol's. Really
good question. Other questions on
salting or hashing?
>> Is is there any sense in rehashing a
password? So, hashing it first. uh a
first time to get string then rehashing
it for for a second string or it just
impractical.
>> No, you could certainly hash the value
multiple times, but a good hash function
should not require that of you,
especially now more recent modern
hashes, one of which we'll look at in a
moment. They should have sufficiently
calculated and proven characteristics
that allow you to hash it just once and
you will get a seemingly random string
that represents whatever that input is.
And here too is where I should emphasize
that when it comes to this world of
hashing and salting and today's other
topics ultimately these are not wheels
that you or I should be reinventing
unless you are the researcher or the
company that's actually developing the
algorithm stress testing them analyzing
them theoretically and practically. So
often in industry or the real world when
people like you and me invent our own
systems for storing information, we just
haven't spent nearly as much time or
we're just not nearly as sharp as some
of the security researchers out there
who have really given this some thought.
So when it comes to all things security,
let me get on my soap box here and say
you and I should not be solving these
problems unless it is your full-time job
uh or calling in life. There's just too
many corner cases unless you're
collaborating with a smart team.
All right, with that said,
here is what hashes generally look like
nowadays in practice. For the sake of
discussion, I deliberately chose a
fairly simple hash function that was
using a fairly short salt, just two
characters, and a fairly short hash
value as output. here in a smaller font,
no less, is how Alice's and Bob's and
Carol's and Charlie's passwords would
probably be stored nowadays using a more
recent modern hash function that notice
by the sheer length of the text on the
screen outputs a much larger value. If
you're familiar from computer science
with the notion of bits, zeros and ones
that are used to store information in
systems, these hash values use many more
bits, many more zeros and ones. You and
I as humans are seeing them as
alphabetical letters and as numbers. But
underneath the hood, these are just more
and more zeros and ones that the
computers is storing, which means it's
much much less likely that someone who
steals this kind of file is going to be
able to figure out efficiently what
those original passwords were. And you
can see too that for both Carol and
Charlie, even though their passwords are
still cherry, these two strings along
the bottom look completely different.
Except in one location here, it turns
out that the scheme a lot of systems
have adopted is that if you look between
dollar signs at the beginning of what
seems to be the hash value, you'll see a
code like y or y or y or y or other
numbers or letters as well. That's a a
little cheat sheet that tells the system
exactly what hash function was used to
generate the rest of it. And that's in
the documentation that you can read
online for any number of hash functions.
So this is to say when you create an
account on some new website or app if
they are doing things well in a manner
consistent with best practices and they
are being mindful of your security they
are probably in a file or in a database
or some other mechanism storing values
that look quite like these based on
whatever password you actually typed in.
In fact, just to give you a sense of how
easy or difficult it might be to crack
passwords, that is figure out what they
are based only on these hashes. In the
case of our first hash function whereby
we had a fairly short hash value being
outputed with or without the salt, turns
out there's 18 quintilion possible hash
values. Now, that's a lot. That's bigger
than last time's quadrillion value. But
with enough time, enough money, enough
cloud computing, e those early hash
functions can be broken. That is with
enough time and energy, you can probably
figure out what someone's password is.
If you fast forward to the other strings
that I showed you on the screen, the
much longer ones that use more bits, so
to speak, then you have this many
possible hash values nowadays. And I
actually did look up how to pronounce
this, but based on reading it on my
screen, I wasn't actually sure how to
say the word since this is a really big
number that my mathematician colleagues
could do a better job pronouncing. But
given how many digits are on the screen,
given how many commas are on the screen
here, this is a really big number such
that you and I probably don't need to
worry about an adversary using brute
force figuring out and still being able
to figure out by the end of time what
the corresponding password might be.
unless there are other weaknesses in the
system. Now, speaking of weaknesses, has
anyone ever forgotten your password?
Yes, of course. But have you ever gone
to a website or app, clicked that link
that says forgot password question mark
in hopes of getting an email of some
sort so that you can reset the password?
I mean, odds are almost everyone here
has experienced that. But has anyone
ever clicked on that link, gotten back
an email that actually contains your
password so that you're just immediately
reminded what it is? I'm seeing a few
nods of the head. You can copy paste it
then into the website. Do not use that
website anymore. That is evidence of
that is a symptom of a website or
application not practicing best
practices. Why? Well, if it is the case
that the website can email you your
password, that means they can see and
they know what your password is, that
means this database, this text file
we've been talking about is probably
vulnerable to some hacker eventually
getting into it and stealing all of
those usernames and passwords in the
clear, no less. Because recall what
these hashes are, they're generally
meant to be irreversible. when you take
as input apple, banana, and cherry, the
output looks completely different with
no obvious relationship to what those
original passwords actually were. And so
if that's what's being stored in the
database, the company who made that
website, the person who made that
website or app, they should not be able
to reverse that process either.
Otherwise, surely the adversary can. So,
it is the case, and I've experienced
this myself often from sort of smaller
shops or companies that maybe haven't
really invested a lot of time or care
into their website. If they are able to
email you your original password, it is
by definition not secure, and it's
certainly not up to today's standards.
It's just too easy for it to be
compromised. So, maybe minimally stop
using that service and make sure you're
not using that password anywhere else.
maximally maybe send them a note
explaining your concern and maybe
linking them to some reference online
maybe this video in which you explain
why you have that concern questions then
on forgetting passwords or hashing or
salting.
>> So as you said some companies may not be
practicing these um hashes and maybe
practicing something very bad. So if I
were let's say a company and I uh
because of my practices I had a leak of
passwords and all the data do I as a
company have any obligations or
responsibility
uh for what happened since I uh have all
the customers data and all their
passwords. Do I have any obligations or
uh responsibilities?
>> It's a really good a really noble
question. The answer to that ethically
is probably yes you should quite simply.
However, the more nuanced answer is that
it's probably going to depend on the
industry that you're in, the country
that you're in, any regulatory
requirements that your company faces,
which might oblige you to report out in
that way. So, I would read up on the
context that's specific to you yourself.
And I will say unfortunately, it is not
that common in the world, I dare say,
that companies document and detail
publicly when there have been security
exploits. They might announce that
something indeed has happened, but it is
rare that companies will go into any
amount of detail. Now, this is
understandable because one, they're
already embarrassed or if not in legal
trouble or financial trouble because
that has happened already. Um, but they
probably typically don't want to provide
other adversaries, other future
attackers with more information about
their systems and the weaknesses that
those systems have. Um the downside of
course society is that if each of us is
sort of secretly getting attacked in
ways we didn't expect learning things
that would be ideal to share with others
in the world. This itself is actually a
big question in the world of cyber
security just how much and how often to
share especially when you discover a bug
or a mistake in someone's system. Do you
tell them privately? Do you tell the
world publicly? Um these are ethical
questions that um we'll touch on indeed
in the coming days as well. Allow me to
propose that separate from these
concerns here, we can come back to some
of those recommendations that we started
the class with when from NIST, the
National Institute for Standards and
Technology. Notice that this was one
other quote we did not share last time.
A recommendation from NIST is that
verifiers shall store memorized secrets
in the form that is resistant to offline
attacks. Memorized secrets shall be
salted and hashed using a suitable
one-way key derivation function. Their
purpose is to make each password
guessing uh trial by an attacker who has
obtained a password hash file expensive
and therefore the cost of guessing
attack of a guessing attack high or
prohibitive. So when I refer to best
practices, I'm really referring to
actual documentation like this either
from the United States, from other cu uh
countries, from other companies. There
are indeed these pra best practices. And
among our goals for this class is to
expose you to some of those both on the
consumer side, you and me as individual
computer users, but also on the
corporate or the academic side as well
as to what you should be doing when you
are in a position of being responsible
for someone else's data as well. Now, as
for the actual hash functions to use
nowadays, these are just some of them
that are generally recommended nowadays
that can be categorized as Shaw 2 and
and Shaw 3. These refer to fairly
sophisticated mathematical functions
that take as input typically a password
or some input more generally and then
output a hash value thereof. There are
other algorithms too that can even be
used to verify the authenticity and
integrity of messages as well. In fact,
today we'll also focus on how we can use
primitives like these to ensure that
data was not actually changed in transit
when you sent it over the internet from
one person to another. But ultimately
what we've been focusing on and what
you've seen on this list here are what
are generally known as oneway hash
functions. That is these are
mathematical functions or in the context
of programming these are functions
written in code languages like Python or
otherwise that take as input a string of
arbitrary length that is a password
that's this long maybe this long maybe
this long but what's key to these
cryptographic functions is they output a
hash value of fixed length that is
always this many bytes or characters or
this many bytes or characters that is
doesn't matter how short or how long the
password is these cryptographic these
one-way hash functions are one way in
the sense that they take a potentially
infinite domain if you know this term
from mathematics and condense it into a
finite range that is a huge number of
values all possible passwords in the
world to just a finite list of possible
hash values it might be a long list of
possible hash values but indeed no
matter how long a string of text is if
it's of some fixed length 16 characters,
32 characters, something else. There's
only a finite number of those values.
Now, there's an implication of this.
When you take a really large input space
or domain mathematically and map it to a
smaller finite range, so to speak,
mathematically, it turns out that if you
do try to reverse the process, there
will be multiple inputs that yield the
same output. Think about it this way. If
you've got a hundred possible passwords
in the world, but you only have 10
possible hash values. So 100 passwords,
10 hash values, you have to figure out
how to put all of those passwords into
10 buckets, so to speak. So surely some
of those passwords are going to be in
the same bucket. Think about it in terms
of the English alphabet. If we stuck
with that original hash function where a
was 1, b was 2, c was three, presumably
z was 26, there's more than m one fruit
that starts with a, apple, avocado, and
so forth. So there too, you were going
to have multiple fruits mapping to the
same finite range of values, hash values
1 through 26. What that means is that if
an adversary or even you, the owner of
the system, look at that hash value and
see the number one, you don't know if
the password was apple or avocado or
some other word that started with a. And
so that's what we mean by one-way hash
functions. You cannot reliably reverse
the process by any means and know
definitively what the original input is.
Now, there is a catch. That technically
means on some systems it might be
possible to log in with Apple or Avocado
or more generally your actual password
and some other seemingly random password
that might make no sense to you but just
because mathematically it has the same
hash value that password too might let
you into the system. But the idea is,
especially as we're using really large
numbers of bits, really long hash
values, the probability of you or me
figuring out or an adversary even
guessing what that other hash value or
hash or what those other inputs or
passwords might be is just so small that
we tend not to worry about it. as well.
The algorithms we've looked at on the
board here are also known as
cryptographic hash functions, which
means they have utility in the world of
cryptography, where the world of
cryptography is all about the practice
and the study of securing data. Securing
data while in transit from one point to
another or while at rest on your own
system. Let's go ahead here and take a a
fivem minute break and when we come back
we'll explore precisely that world of
cryptography with respect to our data.
All right, we're back and indeed
cryptography is all about the practice
and study of securing our data
particularly when we want to transmit it
from one person to another. So
cryptography can be broken down into a
couple of different categories. One of
which are codes. And codes are not the
type of code that you might write in
Python or the like. It has nothing to do
with software, but rather a mapping
between what we'll call code words and
the actual message or true reading that
those words represent. Here, for
instance, is an actual book from over a
hundred years ago that was used to map
these code words in the left column to
these indeed messages or true readings
on the right. The idea is that if that
one party wanted to send a secure
message to another party, they wouldn't
just write it out in plain English. Why?
Because if that message written on a
piece of paper or parchment were
intercepted by another human, that other
human, assuming they too know English,
could just read the actual message, the
so-called plain text. In a code uh
though you can convert the words that
you want to say to code words that make
no sense necessarily to someone who's
intercepted the message in and of itself
unless they too have this book. Now, you
can imagine this being a fairly
timeconsuming process because when the
recipient receives that message, unless
they've memorized all of these pages,
these code words and the meanings
thereof, they have to do quite a bit of
work flipping through their copy of the
book in order to figure out what that
message is. But the fact that they have
a copy of the book too is a potential
threat because if one party or another
had their code book stolen, then any of
the messages they've sent can now be
decoded, so to speak, by looking them up
retrospectively. And any future
messages, if the owners of the book
don't realize that code book has been
taken, so too could those messages be
translated. Not to mention the fact it's
fairly cumbersome. This alone is page
187. And so that's quite a bit of codes
and quite a bit of work just to achieve
this layer of indirection. But there are
some terms of art here that you are
worth knowing and you might actually use
in everyday context but not necessarily
for the same purpose. So encode what do
we mean by that? It means taking a plain
text message be it in English or any
human language and taking that as input
and producing as output code text. So,
the code text might be a short, succinct
sequence of words that might actually be
English words, but they're not meant to
mean what they normally mean. They're
meant to be looked up in the code book
to figure out what the message is
actually trying to say. Meanwhile,
decode, as you might expect, is the
opposite. You take as input the code
text that you have received as the
recipient. You use that same code book
to look up the code words and figure out
what the actual message is in order to
get the original plain text be it in
English or any other human language that
the code book is designed for. But
there's an alternative to codes if only
because those code books can get very
cumbersome indeed. They can be taken and
compromised and the like. So it's not
necessarily the best system and that you
need to physically keep something like
that secure, let alone do so efficiently
when converting. So there are also what
we'll call ciphers and ciphers are more
algorithmic in nature. So if you have
taken a computer science or programming
course, you already have the
predisposition to thinking
algorithmically and taking a big problem
and breaking it down into smaller pieces
and then applying some kind of logic
sometimes again and again in order to
solve some problem. So ciphers focus on
exactly that. They don't focus on maybe
words or phrases. they might focus on
individual letters instead or even bits
if it's in the context nowadays of
computers. So in the world of ciphers,
you might have actually seen them in
popular culture. So here for instance is
just one frame from a famous film known
as A Christmas Story at least here in
the US. It plays like every day all day
long on a couple of TV channels around
Christmas time. But this here is uh
Ralphie, one of the main characters in
the movie and whole in his hands here is
this secret decoder pin that he tried so
hard to get through the mail. And this
secret decoder depend was from little
orphan Annie herself. And what it does
is implement mechanically a cipher
converting one letter to a number and
back, but the thing twists left and
right so you can actually figure out
what the mapping might be. So this is
more of a cipher because it's operating
at a lower level, not on entire words or
phrases, but one letter at a time. And
it's a repeatable process that Ralphie
in this case can apply again and again
to all of the letters of the secret
message. In World War II, the Germans,
for instance, had the Enigma machine
that you might have read about or seen
depicted in films. And this was a
mechanical implementation of this same
idea of a cipher, but instead of using
mathematics or gears turning just this
way and that, it was much more
mechanical was with rotors and lights
and the like, but it too was
implementing a cipher and could be
configured with different inputs in
order to influence exactly what the
output would be. But that too was a
physical device. And we'll focus here
for the most part though on things more
digital things that you can ultimately
for instance nowadays implement much
more readily and much more scalably in
software. But the words we'll use are
pretty much the same. To incipher a
message means to take that message in
English or any other language are
so-called plain text and convert it not
surprisingly to cipher text as output.
Meanwhile, the reverse of or rather an
equivalent term here that you might know
as well is to encrypt. Same idea,
synonyms for our purposes. Plain text to
cipher text, to incipher or to encrypt.
Nowadays, encrypt is probably the more
common of those terms. Meanwhile,
decipher would be the opposite of that,
to actually take the cipher text that
someone else has sent to you, run it
through an algorithm or cipher, and get
back the plain text. Meanwhile, decrypt
would be a synonym for that phrase,
which refers to exactly the same process
of taking cipher text as input and
outputting plain text as output. So, how
do we configure these ciphers so that
you and I can use the same algorithm,
but customize them not only with our own
messages, but also with our own settings
so that just because you and I might
want to send the same plain text doesn't
mean that the cipher text has to
actually be identical. And indeed in the
world of cryptography it's quite
recommended that you and I use public
and well doumented well tried and tested
algorithms publicly but we do keep one
piece of information secret so that our
use of that cipher that algorithm is
specific to us and this customization
this configuration are generally known
as keys. Now, key is much like a
physical key to a lock on an actual door
to your home. A key is what sort of
unlocks the capabilities of this cipher,
but it's a key that needs to be known
and used not only by you typically, but
also by the recipient. So that by having
copies of the same key, you can not only
encrypt messages or incipher them, but
you can also decrypt or decipher those
messages, too. Now, what are these keys
in practice? They're not physical
objects in the virtual world, but really
just really big numbers. And often
there's some mathematical significance
of these numbers. And sometimes those
numbers don't even look like numbers.
They might be presented on your phone or
your laptop or desktop actually as
letters of an alphabet and maybe even
with some punctuation, too. But at the
end of the day, they're really just
numbers. Or, of course, if you know a
bit of computer science already, they're
really just zeros and ones. But it's
perhaps helpful to think about them
metaphorically as akin to these physical
keys. Now, how are these keys actually
used? Well, within the world of
cryptography,
there are different types of encryption.
And the first we'll look at is known as
secret key cryptography. The presumption
is that the security of your data relies
on the secrecy of some key. So, if A
wants to send a message to B, then A and
B must keep secret whatever key they are
using to configure their choice of
algorithms. So what do we mean by that?
Well, secret key cryptography,
specifically in the context of
encryption in scrambling data, is also
known as symmetric key encryption for
the reason that both A and B in this
story are going to use the exact same
key. And we'll contrast this in just a
bit with asymmetric key encryption,
which solves other problems as well. So
let's consider the process of encryption
much like the process of hashing as
being this black box. Somehow or other,
this black box is going to encrypt
information for me, taking as input my
plain text and hopefully outputting as
output my cipher text that I can
actually send over the internet or some
other channel to a recipient as well. So
in the context then of secret key
encryption, the picture looks a little
something like this. Not only do you
pass as input to the algorithm your
plain text message in English or any
other human language, you also pass a
key. And for now, just think of that key
as a number that you and the other
person have somehow agreed upon in
advance. That algorithm then will
ultimately output the cipher text. And
to be clear, the motivation for that key
is to ensure that if I and you and you
and you and you are all using the exact
same encryption algorithm, it's not
going to be obvious if and when we're
sending the exact same messages because
that too, per our discussion of
passwords, would leak information. Maybe
you don't care about the information
being leaked, but it's probably not a
good thing if just because someone else
is sending some message, that makes it
more likely that an adversary can infer
what it is you sent because the cipher
text just so happens to look the same.
We want our cipher text to be unique to
each of our transmissions. So, let's
consider a simple simple example.
Suppose that the message I want to send
is just as short as the capital letter
A. And suppose that the key that I want
to use is as simple as the number one.
These are not good best practices, but
we'll use them for the sake of
discussion. Let me propose that the
simplest algorithm I can perhaps think
of is actually one that would take A as
input and one as input and output B. And
you can perhaps infer where this is
going. If I instead provide B as input
and one as input for the plain text and
key respectively, then the output is C.
So believe it or not in yester year
Julius Caesar was known to use an
algorithm like this by lore whereby this
algorithm Caesar cipher is what's
generally known as a rotational cipher
because you're sort of rotating the
letters of the English alphabet. A
becomes B, B becomes C. And I bet if we
continue this logic, we can go around
from Z becoming A as well. Now this of
course is being applied at the moment to
very short messages that are not that
useful. sending A or B or C is not
particularly useful in general, but it's
demonstrating how we can incipher or
encrypt our plain text into our cipher
text. However, when someone receives
this message, they need to know not only
what algorithm I used to encrypt it, in
this case, Caesar cipher or a rotational
cipher more generally, but they also
need to know what the key is. And the
key might not be as simple as one. Here,
for instance, is an example of 13. If
your key is 13 and your plain text is a,
then your cipher text should be n
because that is 13 places away from a.
And so now the algorithm seems a little
less obvious. Uh 13 is also
representative of something that's long
been known on the internet as rot 13 for
ro 13, rotate 13 places. It's a very
popular way of scrambling information,
but not in a way that you intend to be
secure. Historically, it was often used
for like movie spoilers online. If you
want to make something a spoiler before
there was CSS and blurring effects on
websites and whatnot, you could just
scramble it. So, it looks completely
encrypted, but it's very easy for
someone else with a click of a button
even to just decrypt it. However, I
would recommend that you not use a key
of 26
because
why? Well, at least in English, there's
only 26 letters of the alphabet, capital
A through capital Z in this case. So, a
key of 26 is going to output for your
cipher text, the exact same thing as
your plain text. So, there's another
joke on the internet whereby, you know,
rot 26 is twice as secure as rot 13
because 13* 2 is 26. And obviously,
that's not the case deductively here.
Now, of course, this particular
algorithm and keys of this small size 1
through 26, not at all secure. Why?
Well, honestly, I don't even need a
computer to crack this cipher. I can
probably take out a piece of paper and
pencil and just try all possible numbers
from 1 to 25. I don't need to even waste
my time with 26 and just figure out via
brute force what key someone might have
used to send a message using this
algorithm. not on even single letters,
but maybe it operates on every
individual letter of their message.
Wouldn't take me that long to probably
figure this out by brute force by hand.
And with code, my gosh, I could write
some Python code probably that does it
even faster than that. So, here on the
screen is some cipher text that I
created in advance. And I'll stipulate
that this cipher text was inciphered
using that same rotational cipher, but
I'm not going to tell you just yet what
key I actually used. it was originally
an English message in all capital
letters. So the task at hand now is to
decrypt this. I dare say whether you are
the intended recipient of the message or
maybe maliciously you've intercepted my
transmission with this message in it and
now you're trying to brute force your
way through by trying and by the looks
of some heads going down and some
scribbling one or two or three. I bet we
could also brute force our way through
this algorithm. But how? Well, how does
the decrypting process work? It's really
just the same thing in reverse. If this
now is our picture and you have cipher
text as your input, you should be able
to pass the same key as input one for
instance or 13 or with no good reason 26
and get back out the plain text. But of
course, the decryption algorithm is
indeed the opposite because you don't
want to just add one position or uh add
two positions or three positions. You
want to subtract one or two or three or
13. You want to go in reverse, so to
speak. And so if I were to pass in B as
the cipher text and one as the key,
well, the plain text decrypted should of
course be A. And that holds now for all
of the other letters of the alphabet,
assuming I'm reversing this process in
order to decrypt. And now I'll let you
glance at the screen here for just a
moment and see if you yourselves can't
figure out what this cipher text is
trying to say. And if you like the idea
of figuring this out, if you want to get
better at this particular skill, you are
an aspiring crypto analysist, I dare
say, focusing on this world of cryp
analysis. And this too itself is a job,
I dare say, particularly with
governments trying to decrypt messages
that might very well have been
encrypted. Now hopefully the world is
using more secure algorithms than these
simple rotational ciphers. And what do I
mean by secure? Hopefully they're using
keys that are much bigger than small
numbers like 1 through 25. Hopefully
they're using much much much larger
numbers, many more bits, if only so that
it takes you and me when we try to uh
apply cryp analysis to cipher text. It
takes us way way longer than this
particular algorithm alone. Now, I don't
want to keep you in suspense, but I also
don't want to spoil this if you'd like
to try your hand at this. So, go ahead
and close your eyes if you don't want to
see the answer to this. Or I suppose you
can just look away from your screen, but
in 5 seconds, I'll reveal what the plain
text actually is. And some of you, if
you've seen that movie I mentioned, will
know immediately why this is the way it
is. But otherwise, you might just see
this as an advertisement of sorts. So,
here we go. Your chance to close your
eyes in five, four, 3, two, one.
from some faces. Some of you have seen
this movie around the holidays, but now
I've taken it off the screen and we'll
move on now with some actual algorithms.
So, if you'd like to come back on replay
and actually see what the answer is,
we'll of course leave it on demand. So,
what are some of the actual algorithms
used nowadays for encryption that are
best practices? This rotational cipher
that I described earlier, Caesar's
simple one is not to be recommended.
It's wonderful for demonstration sake
and discussion sake, but it's not
something you should be using in
practice unless, for instance, you're
in, say, middle school trying to send a
message on a piece of paper through your
classroom of classmates and worried that
the teacher might intercept it and the
teacher probably doesn't have the uh
instinct to or the care to actually
brute force their way through it and
figure out what the key is. But that's
the level of security you're getting
with something like that rotational
cipher. But in the real world with our
phones and desktops and laptops today,
generally used are AEES or tripleDes.
Both of which are popular algorithms
that have been vetted by the world and
are very commonly used as secret key
encryption ciphers or symmetric key
encryption ciphers, which to be clear
require that both the sender and the
receiver know and use the exact same
key. And for our purposes today, let me
just stipulate that the mathematics of
these two and other algorithms much more
sophisticated and documented in
textbooks. But therefore, it makes it
much harder for the adversary to figure
out as by trying 25 different keys what
the actual key in use might be.
Questions now about secret key
cryptography
or any of the primitives we've just
discussed. So is it possible that if
someone hacks the h like gets to know
about the hash value the hash function
of a company that it is using he might
be able to use the hash values and use
like find a reverse function and then
get the passwords for that.
>> A good question. I wouldn't worry
mathematically about someone reversing
the hash functions if only because with
all of the ones that are in popular use
today in modern systems. There are a lot
of smart mathematicians, computer
scientists, professionals who have kind
of vetted if not proven mathematically
that these things work as expected.
However, if the passwords that have been
hashed are relatively easy to guess or
if the adversary just gets lucky with
whatever technique they are using, it is
absolutely possible to find at least a
password, a input that maps to that hash
value, but often not without significant
effort. And so, generally, a company
does not want to should not try to keep
proprietary or secret what hash function
they're using, what encryption algorithm
they're using. If anything, I dare say
it should be reassuring to the public if
and when companies are using best
practices and deacto standards. All of
these algorithms are designed to keep
secret, not the algorithm itself, which
literally can be found in like
university textbooks nowadays and on
Wikipedia and beyond, but rather to keep
secret the thing that's designed to be
secret, which is the key. And now, if
you're using too small of a key, like I
did originally, well, then you're just
using the algorithm poorly, perhaps. But
so long as you're adhering to best
practices and picking a really big
recommended size key, then things
mathematically should be trustworthy
>> for an attacker rather than like uh
basically cracking a hash or cracking an
algorithm. Um wouldn't it be easier to
just try and access the basically server
database and access the hash function
like generator code? So rather access
how the specific algorithm works that
way. um they can basically just reverse
engineer it.
>> Everything you described is possible.
However, I would push back on this
assumption that the company should try
to keep its hash algorithm uh secure or
hidden. You should trust in the
mathematics of what we're discussing
today, both in the context of hashes and
in the context of encryption. And I've
pulled back up on the screen here the
number of possible hashes that exist
when using one of the most modern
standards for hashing passwords. This is
such a big number. I dare say I don't
remember how many atoms are in the
universe, but I'm going to guess it's
fewer than this. Maybe the idea is
intuitively that if the search space of
possible hash values or the search space
of possible keys is so darn big, both
you and I, not to speak darkly, are
going to be dead before the attacker
actually figures out what that pass word
or that hash actually is. Um, so that's
generally the presumption. Most of what
we do today in terms of security all
boils down to probabilities and trying
to drive the probability of being
exploited way way way down. Even though
if your password is still 000000
doesn't matter if there's this many or
more possibilities if the adversary
tries that one first. So keeping
algorithms secret keeping ciphers secret
is generally not best practice. You
should be trusting that the math and the
probabilities will protect your data if
you are using these algorithms
correctly. And how about one more
question before we resume? Uh how cipher
work with uh uh word not number like
with words. How it work? Um how we can
uh cipher cryptograph
uh letter um our letters with words not
a number? How it can work?
>> Okay. So, if your key is a word and not
a number, let me first say that
generally when it comes to encryption,
the the keys are not words. These are
not passwords. They're not meant to be
used in quite the same way. These keys
are generally generated by the computer
for you. And so, as such, they're just
random numbers for the most part. Um,
with that said, even if it is a word
like Apple, there are ways and you might
you would learn this in a class like
CS50 itself to convert a word to the
underlying numeric representation.
There's a system called ASKI or Unicode.
So, capital A is actually the number 65
in most systems. Capital B is the number
66. But we can go one level deeper.
There's actually a pattern of zeros and
ones that represent A's and B's and C's
and so forth. So we can convert
everything in the world of computers to
numbers and for that let me encourage
you to take CS50X online. So that then
is secret key cryptography or symmetric
key cryptography. But it doesn't solve
all of our problems because I've kind of
taken for granted throughout this whole
discussion that the sender and the
receiver have a shared secret between
them. Whether it's a simple key like one
or two or 13, hopefully not 26 or
hopefully some much bigger value. But
there's kind of a a chicken and the egg
problem there so to speak in English
whereby how do you actually establish a
shared secret between parties A and B if
A and B have never talked before be uh
in fact so for instance if you're
visiting Amazon.com for the first time a
popular e-commerce website or gmail.com
for your email ideally and you probably
know this already from just living in
the real world nowadays ideally you want
that connection to Amazon or Gmail to be
encrypted, to be scrambled in some way.
Why? Well, you don't want your password
being stolen by someone. You don't want
your credit card number being
intercepted by someone. You don't want
your personal emails being read by other
people. So, it stands to reason that
encryption is generally a good thing.
And you've seen this perhaps in the URL
bar via something called HTTPS, where
the S literally is meant to mean secure.
But odds are you don't know anyone
personally at amazon.com and you don't
know anyone personally at gmail.com. So
what key are you going to use to
communicate securely with these
websites? Not to mention new websites
that don't even exist today but might
come online tomorrow. How do you
establish a shared secret with someone
else? So that's sort of a fundamental
gotcha or caveat with symmetric key or
secret key encryption is that assumes
that you have a shared secret between
you and the other person. But the
chicken and the egg scenario comes in
whereby the only way to establish a
shared secret would be to send it to the
other person securely. But if you can't
communicate securely, you can't even
send them the secret you want to use. So
you're sort of caught in this deadlock.
Thankfully, thanks to math, there are
ways that we can solve this too via not
symmetric key cryptography, but public
key cryptography, otherwise known as
asymmetric key cryptography. And among
the algorithms here might be these,
something called diffy helman, MQV, RSA,
and others as well. And I dare say on
this list, maybe RSA is among the most
well-known is perhaps an acronym you've
actually seen in the wild. Now what do
we mean by public key cryptography or
more specifically public key encryption?
Well, in the world of public key
encryption or asymmetric key encryption,
the asymmetry is implying that you
actually don't use one key between the
two people A and B, you actually use two
keys. In the world of public key
encryption, everyone in the world has
both a public key and a private key. And
these two are just really big numbers.
There is a mathematical relationship
between these numbers, the public key
and the private key. But that's a
relationship that your phone or your
laptop or your desktop figures out when
generating these values for you. So
unlike our previous discussion of
passwords, which you and I as humans do
choose and memorize or store in our
password managers, when it comes to
keys, these are generally in the world
of public key cryptography generated for
you. And as the name suggests, the whole
purpose of these keys is to tell the
whole world if you want what your public
key is. It is not in any way secret. You
can literally email it out. You can put
it in the signature of every email. You
can post it on your website, on social
media. The whole point of the public key
is to make it indeed public. But suffice
it to say, the private key should be
kept secret by you. Private by you on
your own device. that should never be
shared with anyone else. But the cool
thing about public key cryptography and
the mathematics underlying it is that if
you share your public key with someone
else on the internet, they can use that
public key to encrypt a message and then
send it to you over email or chat or any
other technology. And if you had to
guess, what is the only key in the world
that can decrypt a message that has been
encrypted with your public key? The only
key in the world that can decrypt a
message that has been encrypted with
your public key is your private key.
That's what the mathematical
relationship ultimately does for you. So
pictorially here, if this is our
algorithm that implements this idea of
public key encryption, let's see what
the inputs and outputs should be. If the
goal is to send a message to you and you
have shared with the world your public
key, whoever is sending you this message
uses your public key, their plain text
message and out of that comes cipher
text. That then is how asymmetric key
encryption works. Meanwhile, when you
receive that message, you can use your
own private key and the cipher text
you've just received to get back the
plain text. And this is what we mean by
asymmetric. Unlike secret key
cryptography or symmetric key
cryptography where you're using the same
key back and forth plus one or minus one
in the case of the rotational cipher
with asymmetric encryption you are using
one key for one process and another key
for the decryption process. So that's
what's fundamentally different. RSA is
one of the most popular algorithms for
this. the browsers you probably use
every day are probably using some
variant of RSA underneath the hood. We
won't get into great detail about the
mathematics, but one of the most
important details about RSA is that it
relies on really big prime numbers. In
fact, in a nutshell, what happens with
RSA is your computer or your phone
chooses a really big prime number called
P. It then chooses a really big other
prime number called Q. Then it
multiplies them together to get a new
value. we'll call it n and it uses that
value n in the resulting mathematics
that the algorithms authors came up with
dot dot dot. The presumption here is
that when you take a really big prime
number and multiply it against a really
big other prime number, it is really
hard to figure out from the product of
those numbers what the original p and q
were. And if you're a little hazy on
prime numbers, it's a number that can be
only that can only be divided by itself,
n1. And indeed, we can use those coming
up with two big ones. Multiply it
together in order to get this value n
that is subsequently used in the rest of
the mathematics. What are the rest of
those mathematics? In essence, this and
this will be the scariest looking
formulas you perhaps see over the course
of this class. The value n I just
described is used as uh to divide values
ultimately. If you're unfamiliar with
mod here, this means to in this context
take the remainder of some value. So
what are we doing here? Is a quick
summary of how encryption and decryption
works with RSA. If you have some message
M that you want to send to another
person and you have come up with somehow
via the dot dot dot process earlier that
I alluded to, you've come up with your
own uh public key e there. Well, then
someone can take their message, encrypt
it by raising that message to the power
of e, the exponent of e, and then divide
it, divide it, divide it, divide it by
n, and figure out what the remainder is
when dividing by n. That then gives you
a value called c for cipher text. When
you then receive that message c, you can
use your private key known here as d,
and you raise the cipher text its
numeric value to the power of d. that is
the exponent in D and you divide divide
divide by n in order to figure out that
remainder which will give you back the
original message. Now that is a
significant oversimplification of what's
going on but that's the essence of the
algorithm. It has to do with picking two
very large prime numbers, multiplying
them together to get that value n and
then using n as well as other values
that dot dot dot are generated by the
algorithm for you e and d in order to
encrypt and decrypt messages ultimately.
And this is what's generally known as
modular arithmetic. It involves lots of
division and division division in order
to come up with these remainders. But
ultimately, it is a very secure way to
asymmetrically share information without
having to agree on one shared key in
advance, but rather using a public and a
private key instead. Now, there are
other techniques that come with this
world of public key cryptography, and
another technique is that of key
exchange. So by contrast, if you do
actually want to establish some kind of
shared secret, there are alternative
algorithms that different humans have
invented over the years. So there are
alternatives to one algorithm or
another. And one of these alternatives
is actually called Diffy Helman named
after another pair of authors here. So
here is the essence of the mathematics
for this algorithm. The goal of which is
indeed key exchange to figure out using
fancy mathematics how both A and B can
come up with the same value that they
can then use as a shared secret but
without anyone who intercepts any of
their messages being able to figure out
what is that shared value that shared
secret. So what's the essence of the
math here? Well, you first pick a value
G which is called a generator. It can be
as simple as the number two. and you
pick a big prime number, call it P here,
and those are agreed upon in advance.
Meanwhile, person A, say Alice, picks
her own private key A, which is another
really big number. And then she does
this math. G to the power of A mod P.
And again, mod refers to taking the
remainder of some value. Meanwhile, B or
Bob still uses the same G, still uses
the same P, picks his own private key
called B and raises G to the power of B
modulo P and that gives him back this
value capital B. Whereas Alice had
capital A. Then turns out that Alice and
Bob can send those values across the
internet. A one way, B the other way.
And thanks to some fancy modular
arithmetic here too, Alice can take
Bob's B value and raise it to the power
of her A value, which effectively gives
you G to the power of A * B mod P. Bob,
meanwhile, can take Alice's A value that
was sent to him, raise it to the power
of his private key B, and then mod P.
So, calculate the remainder with respect
to P. the end result and it's totally
fine if these mathematics are
uncomfortable for you or just know that
thanks to some basic principles of
mathematics this results in both Alice
and Bob having the exact same value
we'll call it S for shared secret even
though the value never went across the
internet in its entirety Alice sent part
of it this way Bob sent part of it this
way but because Alice and Bob held on to
private values the little A and the
little B. They kept that to themselves.
They are able to do these mathematics
that ensure that they both came up with
the same value. Even though you or I, if
we intercepted any one of those
messages, we could not figure out what
it is. And now that they have a shared
secret s, they can use that using any of
those other symmetric ciphers we talked
about earlier. AES I put on the board
briefly. Triple DEES I put on the board
briefly. Heck, we could even use this in
a rotational cipher if we really wanted
to, but not indeed best practice. So
again, don't worry so much about
focusing on the mathematics, but if you
were to take a higher level class in
theoretical computer science, these are
intellectual rabbit holes that you could
go down to better understand how the
software works. And now to my comment
earlier about not trying to invent your
own cryptographic functions like this is
the kind of reason why this is the
degree of sophistication that you and I
take for granted in our phones, our
laptops and desktops that have been
vetted by industry and academics alike.
generally best practice is to rely on
standards that have been tried and
tested rather than try to come up with
your own creative crypto system so to
speak that may very well have faults
that you yourself do not know. And the
icing on the cake is that this is
ultimately if curious as to the
underlying mathematics what value
ultimately Alice and Bob are both
calculating g to the power a * b mod p.
But more on that in a higher level
mathematics course if indeed of
interest. How about one final building
block that you get from this world of
public key cryptography? And this is one
that's going to be increasingly
omnipresent I do think in our world
especially as we move away from very
archaic paper pencil signatures that you
might write with a pen on a paper and
rather moving to what we'll call digital
signatures as well. It turns out that
once you're comfortable with the idea of
public key cryptography, generally
involving a public key and a private
key, the first of which is literally
public, you can share it with the world,
the second of which is meant to be
private, kept only to you. And if you
can take at face value my claim that
through appropriate mathematics, there's
a relationship possible between these
two numbers that whereas one can encrypt
data, the other can decrypt. Even if you
don't care to get into the ma specifics
of the mathematics, but you just agree
that okay, that sounds reasonable to me
that that math can work. We can now use
that building block of a public key and
a private key to solve other problems as
well. Not just encrypt messages from
point A to point B and back, but rather
to sign information, sign documents even
and say yes, this was signed by David or
someone else. So, how does this work in
the world of digital signatures? Here's
a few more acronyms of algorithms that
are commonly used even though we'll
continue to simplify them in our
discussion. Uh, DSA, ECDSA, RSA, and
others can be used to give you the
ability to sign documents or other
pieces of information digitally. So,
what does it mean to sign something
digitally? It's not at all like this
with a unique signature. It's all
mathematics involved. So here then might
be our algorithm for digitally signing
some document or piece of information.
And I claim that the input to this
process is a message, a letter that
you've written, a contract that you want
to sign, something that you want to put
your digital signature on. The output of
this message initially is going to be a
hash. So we can use any of uh any number
of hash functions we talked about
earlier that take as input an arbitrary
length input like a message, a document,
an essay, a contract and produce as
output a fixed length hash value. So
we've seen that and we've stipulated
that that is indeed possible. Similar in
spirit to our password discussion
earlier, you can even do it for larger
inputs than passwords. You can do it for
entire documents as well. Once you have
that hash, here's how you digitally sign
the document. You use your private key.
You pass that as input as well as the
hash value you just computed a moment
ago into the digital signature
algorithm. And the output of that
process is a signature. So, if you think
about this intuitively, what are we
doing? Well, we're taking an arbitrary
sized document. Maybe it's a a letter
that you've written. Maybe it's a
contract that you've written that you
need to sign. That might be short or it
might be really long. Here's where the
value of cryptographic hash functions
come in. Recall that a cryptographic
hash function by definition takes an
arbitrary size input and reduces it to a
fixed size output. So it doesn't matter
how big the original was, you can
distill it into a distinct
representation that's shorter. So per
this diagram, if you take that hash
value and you encrypt it with your
private key, what we say is that the
output of that process, which is just a
really big number or some sequence of
weird looking text, is your digital
signature. Now, this is a little weird
because what we're doing now is the
opposite of public key encryption. With
public key encryption, remember someone
else used your public key to encrypt the
message to you and you used your private
key to decrypt it. But in the case of
digital signatures, the story gets
flipped upside down. You use your
private key and a hash of your message
to digitally sign your document. And the
output of that is a signature, again, a
number or some string of text. And you
send that signature to the recipient
saying, ""This is my digital signature.
You can verify it now if you so choose
and they should. So that invites the
question, well, how does the recipient
verify your digital signature? How do
they know that this weird looking
sequence of characters or numbers
actually was signed by you? Well, recall
that you have not only a private key,
but a public key as well. And that
public key is accessible to everyone,
including that recipient. And so what
happens is this. When that recipient
gets your document and your digital
signature, so to speak, they probably
want to and should verify the digital
signature to confirm that yes, you
signed off on that document or contract.
So, what does that box look like? Well,
they have received not only the document
itself, the so-called message, they've
also received your digital signature.
So, you've sent them two things. And the
digital signature, you can think of it
like a human signature, but it's of
course a big number or a string of text.
But they've sent you two things, the
document and that signature. So what do
you do? You take the document you've
received and you run it through the
exact same publicly available hash
function because the document might be
long. So you want to collapse it into a
short hash representation thereof just
like our use of passwords. So that you
can just do easily no private
information involved. But then what do
you do? You then take the public key of
the person who signed this document. You
take the signature that they claim is
their signature and you decrypt their
signature with their public key. That
should output the exact same hash that
you just calculated. So to summarize,
the message itself, the document in this
story is public. It's not encrypted.
It's not something you really worry
about being private. What you really
care about in this story is that it was
signed by a specific person. So if that
message, that document is available to
both the sender and the receiver, both
of them do this first process of hashing
the message, hashing the document just
to get some succinct representation
thereof. So it's not this big, it's this
big. Makes the math quicker and easier.
However, what the recipient does is upon
receiving not only that message which
they just hashed but also your claimed
digital signature, they try to decrypt
your signature using your public key.
And here too, just as the private key
can reverse the encryption done by a
public key, so can the public key
reverse the encryption done by a private
key. So if the recipient mathematically
gets the exact same hash after
decrypting what you sent them, it must
be the case mathematically that the only
person in the world who could have
signed this document is in fact you
because they have your public key and
maybe some third party, some registry,
some company has said yes, that is David
Men's public key. You can trust that.
And so if David Mail's private key has
not been compromised, you can trust that
any signature that you can decrypt with
my public key must have been encrypted
with my private key. And it takes a
while, I think, for these ideas and
certainly the mathematics to sink in.
But for now, if you just trust that
there's two big numbers in the world,
one public, one private, there's a
mathematical relationship between them,
such that one can reverse the effects of
the other in either direction. We humans
can use this now not only to secure our
messages per our discussion of
encryption, we can also use it to
authenticate messages and attest yes,
this came from David Men or did not. And
unlike a human signature on a piece of
paper that can obviously just be
photographed, duplicated, traced over,
the secrecy of digital signatures relies
on keeping your private key private. And
that notion does not exist in the world
of human signatures. And so in that
sense, digital signatures are
objectively better than our old form
human ones.
Questions now, and I know that's a lot,
and it's okay if it didn't all go down
at once. questions on digital
signatures, public key encryption or
decryption or anything prior.
>> Would these public and private keys be
attributed to what your IP address?
>> A good question uh to what are they
attributed not to your IP address
typically? They are typically stored in
a registry like a central registry that
knows that this is Vlad's public key,
this is David's public key and so forth.
And it relies on a system of trust and
transitivity. So if you trust this
third-party company that is storing all
of our public keys, then you can trust
whoever it is they are in turn trusting.
Or it can be more distributed. Your
public key can literally be distributed
in the footer of your emails. It can be
posted on your website. It can be on
your LinkedIn profile or the like. And
so long as other people in the world
trust your emails or your website or
LinkedIn, they can trust that that is in
fact your public key. So different ways
to implement that system of trust. Other
questions?
>> Hashing uh uses a mathematical function
and encryption uses a mathematical
function plus a key like the Caesar
cipher basically uses um the simple
function plus plus the key. Is that
analogy correct?
>> Yes, that is correct. And if it helps
you, this is an oversimplification,
but it's generally helpful, I think, to
think of hashing as one way. So, you can
only convert a value to a hash value,
but not the opposite. But encryption is
like two-way. It's reversible hashing,
so to speak. The output still looks
weird and random, but you can undo the
process. And one way to think about this
is in the world of hashing because I
claim that you can take like an infinite
domain like any possible message you
want to send and convert it to a finite
range. For instance, all A words could
be a hash value of one. All B words
could have a hash value of two. That
simple example already captures the
reality that if you only have the hash
fun the hash values one two I have no
idea what the original input is and it
doesn't matter how hard I try I'm never
going to figure it out because it could
be apple or avocado or something else
that starts with a. So hashing in that
sense one way hashing throws away
information such that it's not
recoverable but encryption
does the opposite. It would be pretty
useless if encryption threw away
information because the whole point of
encryption is to secure messages and
information we want to send. So
encryption is reversible. Hashing in
general is not.
And as you know the key, no pun intended
to encryption is necessary so that you
can reverse the process in a way that
remains secret to other people. How
about one more question and then we'll
take a short break and then we'll come
back and wrap up.
>> Uh is there any possibility to spoof the
signatures?
>> Uh short answer, no. Like so long as you
are using a standard that we believe to
be correct and not compromised, so long
as your private key has not been stolen
by someone or no one's taken it off of
your phone or your computer, they should
not it should not be possible to forge
it. It the probability is so so so low.
It should be the least of your concerns
is the idea. Now, it turns out there is
yet one other application of this world
of public key cryptography that solves a
problem from last time. Recall that we
ended our first class on a note of
emphasizing that passwords and password
managers can improve our security if
used properly. But there's another
technology that's becoming increasingly
available and it's colloquially called
pass keys or more technically it's an
implementation of a standard called web
authentication. And it turns out that
these pass keys which are available on
certain platforms and certain websites
and ever more will be available soon
quite shortly. They too rely on public
and private keys as follows. And
thankfully now, as fancy as the
mathematics we're alluding to today
sound, there really aren't only two ways
to use these public and private keys to
either encrypt with one and decrypt with
the other or vice versa. So we have just
a fairly basic building block that we
can use in one direction or another. So
how do pass keys work? In the near
future, as you will find, when you go to
certain websites or applications, you
probably will not be prompted as
frequently to type in a username and
pick a password. Which is to say, you
don't have to generate a hard to guess
password. You don't have to memorize a
hard to guess password. You don't have
to even store a hard to guess password
in a password manager because pass keys
eliminate passwords. It moves us more
toward a world of passwordless accounts.
Now, how can that be? Because up until
now, we've been using usernames and
passwords to authenticate ourselves.
Well, it turns out we humans have been
getting really good at this math. Even
if it doesn't feel like it today, we've
been getting really good at using
mathematics to solve these problems as
well. So, imagine the following
scenario. When you go to a website in
the future or app, rather than being
prompted to create a username and
password, you'll just be prompted to
create a pass key. What that means is
your laptop or desktop or phone will
probably prompt you with some form of
factor. They'll ask you for your
fingerprint or they'll ask you for a
scan of your face or maybe a pin code, a
short number that you type in just to
demonstrate with high probability that
you are authorized to be using this
device and creating this account. What
then will your device and the website
do? Your device will generate a public
key and a private key just for that one
website or app. Your device will send
the public key to that new website along
with your user ID or username, some
identifying information so that they
know you're David or someone else. But
you don't send a password. you only send
to the website or app your uh public key
and you keep private within your browser
or some other piece of software your
corresponding private key. And to be
clear, this public private key pair is
used only for this one website. You'll
do this repeatedly but automatically for
every other website in the world in this
model. So what happens when you not
register for that website which you've
just done but you want to log into it
tomorrow, next week or next year? Well,
assuming you still have that same device
or you're using some kind of cloud
service that synchronizes all of your
past keys, your public and private keys
across devices, so you haven't lost
these past keys. Here's how you would
log into the website tomorrow, next
week, or next year. The website would
send you when you visit a challenge. And
a challenge is like some little message.
It's like a number or a word or a
phrase. It's some piece of randomly
generated data that the website wants
you to digitally sign. Well, how do you
digitally sign information? I proposed
earlier that you can use your private
key and pass that key and that
challenge, which is just a random input
given to you by the website into your
digital signature algorithm, this black
box. And the output of that, as before,
is your signature. And what does your
device do? It sends that signature for
that challenge to the website. And if
you followed along earlier well enough,
you might now realize where we're going
with this. How does the website now
verify that that is in fact your
signature? That this did come from
David's device and not some adversary
online. the website because it stored
yesterday, last week, last year your
public key, it will use your public key
to decrypt your signature using the same
algorithm to get back hopefully the same
challenge value. And if the output of
this verification process matches the
challenge the website sent you a second
before, it must be the case
mathematically that you are in fact who
you claim to be because it was your
device that registered for this website
a day, a week, a year ago as well. So
again, if we trust in the mathematics
here and we trust that these algorithms
allow us to encrypt information and
decrypt it using a public key and
private key or conversely a private key
and public key, we can with very very
high confidence probabilistically say
yes, this is David Men. I'm going to
allow him back into this account. So
what's the implication of this
passwordless world that uses pass keys
or web authentication more technically?
It means that we're getting out of the
business potentially as a society of
having to remember dozens or hundreds or
thousands of different passwords for all
of our accounts. It does require though
that we don't lose the device or the
devices that registered for these
websites or apps. But again,
increasingly is the world uh providing
cloud services whether it's with Apple
or Microsoft or Google or others that
presumably can synchronize your pass
keys across devices. And we'll conclude
ultimately today by talking about how
they can be synchronized securely even
without Google and Microsoft and Apple
knowing what your own pass keys are so
long as they provide us with a certain
technical guarantee. So the upside of
this is we can move away from passwords
it and you can even share these pass
keys with other people if you so choose.
The catch is right now they're not
omniresently available on every website
out there. It's probably going to take
some time for the world to come on
board, but I do dare say in the coming
weeks, months, and years, you will see
pass keys increasingly offered to you.
And so indeed, the next time you visit a
website that asks you, hey, do you want
to register with your fingerprint or
with your face or with a pin code, and
you're never even asked for a password,
odds are it's using this pass key
technology instead. Well, let's go ahead
and take one more five minute break here
and when we come back, we'll talk about
securing data as it's moving back and
forth and sitting on our own systems.
All right, so we're back and allow me to
claim that we now have a bunch of ways
to hash data and also encrypt data and
also now decrypt data. So, how can we
use these building blocks to solve some
other perhaps familiar problems? Well,
there's this notion of encryption in
transit, which is a fancy way of saying
that you and I probably prefer nowadays
that our data be encrypted whenever it's
traveling from point A to point B,
whether that point B is Amazon.com,
gmail.com, WhatsApp, or any other
service that we're communicating with.
We ideally want no one in between us,
some machine in the middle, so to speak,
to be able to get at that some same
data. Because in particular, what you
should be worried about is a scenario
like this where if Alice is trying to
communicate with Bob, you might worry
that there's some eavesdropper, so to
speak, named Eve between Alice and Bob.
And maybe this is via wires nowadays on
the internet. Maybe it's somehow
wirelessly. Maybe Eve actually
represents a company that Alice and Bob
are communicating between like Gmail or
Outlook or the like. So encryption in
transit though is important to
distinguish from other forms of
encryption. In particular here Alice
might very well have an encrypted
connection not to an eavesdropper per se
but just a third party like Gmail. So
assume that Eve here is Gmail. And
meanwhile Bob when checking his email
account has an encrypted connection to
Eve as well which in this story now is
Gmail. So Alice has a secure connection
to Gmail and Bob has a secure connection
to Gmail as well. But that does not mean
necessarily that Alice has a secure
connection to Bob. Security does not
really work through transitivity, so to
speak. This might very well mean that
the data is only encrypted while in
transit from A to E and from B to E. But
that doesn't mean that Eve or Gmail in
this story can't be reading all of
Alice's and Bob's emails. And indeed,
that is technically possible on Google's
end. They of course run all of the
servers that your Gmail accounts might
be on. There's nothing technically
probably stopping them from reading
anything and everything. Now, hopefully
they have policies. Hopefully very few
humans actually have the privileges or
the authorization to even do anything
close to that. But technically speaking,
just because Alice has a secure
connection to Gmail and Bob has a secure
connection to Gmail, that doesn't mean
that their communications will be
encrypted entirely between A and B. And
there are lots of examples of this as
well. Zoom, for instance, when it comes
to video conferencing, you might have an
encrypted connection to Zoom. I might
have an encrypted connection to Zoom.
That does not necessarily mean that Zoom
couldn't be Eve in this story listening
and watching everything that we're
saying while video conferencing as well.
So encryption in transit is good in that
it at least keeps random people out of
the picture because they don't have
access to these encrypted channels. But
if there is this third party, this
machine in the middle or company in the
middle, even they might have access to
data that we do not want them to have
access to. So what then is an a stronger
alternative? Increasingly possible,
increasingly available, and something
you as a user should be looking for with
greater frequency is what we'd call end
toend encryption. This is a stronger
guarantee whereby you can trust that
Alice's connection to Bob is in fact
secure. Even if, not pictured here,
there are one, two, three, four machines
in the middle, companies in the middle,
eavesdroppers in the middle. If you use
encryption properly, end to end, you can
ensure that the only thing Eve or Google
or Zoom can see is just your cipher
text. the seemingly random strings of
text or zeros and ones that represent
your encrypted data. But without your
key, they have no idea what that data
actually is. So end-to-end encryption
isn't necessarily in most companies best
interest. Why? Well, companies like
Gmail tend to presumably mine our data,
whether it's for advertising purposes or
otherwise. And so it's sometimes in
company's interest to have access to
your data to keep it secure on their
servers but still in a way that they
have access to it. Now that might be uh
not comfortable for you and so there are
alternatives for instance iMessage for
Apple users and WhatsApp internationally
is known in particular for offering end
toend encryption which if implemented
truthfully and technically correctly
should guarantee that even though your
messages might be going through WhatsApp
servers no employee at WhatsApp can
actually see your messages because it's
encrypted all the way from A to B even
though it's going through a potential
potential eavesdropper but that depends
on exactly what form of encryption
you're using and if it's not endtoend it
might only be encrypted in transit such
that ees that eavesdropper might indeed
have access to the data. So as to how
you can use end-to-end encryption it's
an option that a service must provide to
you in this case or you must choose
services that offer it. It's not
necessarily something that's always
available but it is increasingly
available in different software. So
let's now consider a fairly mundane
operation but one that has implications
for these same technologies and
solutions that is deleting a file be it
on your Mac or your PC or your phone or
some other device. Now where are where
is data stored in your devices? Well,
generally it might be in a device like
this, a large, somewhat older but large
hard drive that can store lots and lots
of files and folders or perhaps
something smaller known as a solidstate
drive that might store information
entirely digitally without any moving
parts. And even smaller might be
something like this that you carry
around like a USB stick and they are
even smaller nowadays too that similarly
stores some data digitally. Now, how do
we go about deleting files from a
computer or any of these devices? Well,
you typically click it and drag it
somewhere, or maybe you rightclick it,
or maybe you tap and drag it to some
trash or the like. There's any number of
user interface mechanisms for deleting
files. But let's consider for our
purposes what happens underneath the
hood. So, let me stipulate that your
hard drive, your solid state drive, your
USB stick just contains ultimately a
whole bunch of zeros and ones. And those
zeros and ones represent your files and
folders. So, when you go about deleting
a file by dragging it to the recycle bin
on Windows or dragging it to the trash
can on Mac OS, what actually happens?
Well, it turns out not anything at all
really. When you recycle a file on
Windows or when you trash a file on Mac
OS, it doesn't actually get deleted in
the sense that you and I might expect.
By deleted, I mean it's gone. Like, I
don't want to be able to find it anyway.
Okay, wait a minute, though. Of course,
we all know by now, at least on
computers, you at least have to empty
the recycle bin or empty the trash can.
So, okay, maybe I missed that step. But
even then, contrary to what you might
expect, emptying the recycle bin,
emptying the trash can also does not
generally delete the data. And here's
where I'd again emphasize, wait a
minute, when I delete a file, I want it
gone, removed from my computer
altogether. But what Mac OS and Windows
and operating systems in general tend to
do instead when you even empty the
recycle bin or trash can, they don't
actually get rid of the file per se,
they just forget where it is. Somewhere
in the computer's memory, there's like a
a spreadsheet of sorts, some kind of
database or table with at least two
columns. One of which has the name of
your file or the location of your file.
The other of which has some kind of
reference to which zeros and ones on
your actual computer implement that
specific file. Maybe these zeros and
ones are for one file, these zeros and
ones are for another file and so forth.
So somewhere your computer is keeping
track of what is where physically on
your computer. But when you delete a
file by emptying the trash or recycle
bin, the computer just eh forgets where
it is. And more importantly, it frees up
the space so it can be used later. So
what do I mean by that? Well, suppose I
do go ahead and delete a file and empty
the recycle bin or trash can. And
suppose that these yellow zeros and ones
represent the file that I no longer care
about. Well, what's actually going to
happen underneath the hood, so to speak,
of the computer? Well, eventually some
of those yellow zeros and ones might
just get reused for other files. In
other words, these zeros and ones
highlighted in yellow represent a file
that used to be there but is not. That
is equivalent to saying, ""Ah, some other
file can now use those same zeros and
ones."" And so, here's some random zeros
and ones that maybe overwrite some of
the file, but not all of it. Notice
there's still a bunch of yellow zeros
and ones here in my depiction of my
computer. So, it turns out that over
time, yes, your file will probably get
actually deleted. What do I mean by
that? Eventually, those zeros and ones
will be repurposed. Changed from one to
zero, changed from zero to one, such
that your file, for all intents and
purposes, is actually gone because it's
been repurposed, that space altogether.
But notice, at least at this point in
time and shortly after you delete a
file, even if you've created or
downloaded new files, there might still
be parts of your files around, which
means that sensitive Word document or
Excel file or images that you had on
your computer, there might still be
remnants of them, just a few lines from
any of those. So, you should realize
that deleting a file doesn't really get
rid of it in the way you might expect or
hope. To do that, you need to be a
little better with practices. Now, what
do I mean by this? Secure deletion is
another beast altogether. And typically,
when we delete files, they're not
deleted securely. They're not deleted
typically in a way that you would hope.
So, secure deletion does what you might
really hope for, get rid of this file
altogether. So, if we go back to the
original contents of my computer with
all of these here, zeros and ones, and
suppose that I want to delete this file
here at the top of the screen, you know,
in an extreme ideal world, those zeros
and ones would just be gone, right?
Like, that's pretty darn secure. Those
bits, those zeros and ones, they don't
even exist anymore. Now, this is
probably not the best way to securely
delete information because if I just got
rid of those zeros and ones somehow,
like my hard drive is getting like
literally smaller and smaller in terms
of how much stuff I can put on it if I
don't have as many bits or zeros and
ones available. So, that's probably not
the best long-term solution because it's
expensive. It's like getting rid of some
of my capacity. So, we don't actually do
that. But, how might we securely delete
a file? I don't think we want to just
wait and hope that those zeros and ones
eventually get reused by the system
because we might still be left with some
remnants which might not be ideal. So
what we can do when securely deleting a
file is something like this. Change all
of the zeros and ones that we don't care
about anymore or want. Change them all
to zeros. And this will effectively
securely delete the file because now the
ones that were previously there that
represented some piece of information
are just completely gone. Or
equivalently, I could change them all to
ones. Or I could even change it to
random zeros and ones. The point is to
securely delete a file. You should
change all of the zeros and ones to at
least some other pattern so that the
file is effectively gone. Now, how can
you use this to your benefit? Well, some
operating systems nowadays support
what's called full disk encryption. And
this is good for a number of reasons.
One, if you enable a feature called full
disk encryption, which is actually a
specific incarnation of an idea known as
encryption at rest. Encryption in
transit refers, of course, to your data
going back and forth from point A to
point B. Encryption at rest means it's
just sitting there on your device in
your pocket or on your lap or on your
desktop uh sitting unused, maybe on or
off. So when it comes to full disc
encryption or encryption at rest, you
ideally want all of your data somehow
encrypted on your Mac, on your PC, on
your phone. And only when you log in
with your password or maybe your
fingerprint or your face should that
data be decrypted automatically. And
this can be hap this can happen pretty
darn fast nowadays with modern hardware
should the data be unencrypted. So you
can actually use it and interact with
that device. So why is this
advantageous? Well, one, if your device
gets stolen, so long as you're not
logged into it, so long as it's locked,
so long as the lid is closed, so long as
it's unplugged, or any other number of
scenarios, at least if someone takes
your laptop from the the table in
Starbucks or the cafe, well, hopefully
if you have a good password or good
biometrics, they're not going to be able
to get any of your data. They can maybe
delete all of your data and they can
sell your computer. They can use your
computer, but they probably, if you're
practicing best practices, don't have
access to the data that's on the system.
Why? Because it's completely encrypted
at rest and they don't know your
password. They don't have your
fingerprint. They don't have your face.
They should not be able to decrypt that
data. So in other words, if this is my
unencrypted data, the way I want it and
need it when I'm using my computer, full
disk encryption at rest would change my
entire computer to look random. These
are random zeros and ones now that I
generated by using, for instance, my
password or my fingerprint or my face.
And this is what your hard drive or your
solid state drive should look like when
the lid is closed, when the power is
off, when you are logged out of it. It
should be random zeros and ones. And the
upside of this now is that again, if
it's stolen while in this state, there's
no data to be used by the adversary
because it looks like random zeros and
ones. Better yet, if you deliberately
want to get rid of the device because
you want to trade it in for resale
value, because you want to donate it to
someone else, because you want to sell
it to someone online, when using full
disc encryption, the upside is that so
long as you had a really hard to guess
password, your data is for all intents
and purposes securely deleted already
because only if the new buyer figures
out or knows your password or has your
same fingerprint or has your same face,
they're not going to be able to access
any of your data anyway. Okay. And this
is important nowadays because it turns
out with modern hardware, even if you
might want to change all of the zeros
and ones to all zeros or all ones or all
random data, it turns out that today's
hardware can fail over time. So even
little USB sticks or solid state drives
over time can kind of wear out. But
they're smart enough thanks to software
known as firmware inside of it. As soon
as the device realizes, wait a minute,
that those bits over there aren't
working properly anymore, the device
might not let you change them to all
zeros or all ones or a random zeros and
ones anymore. It might just leave them
as is forever. Which is to say, it's
even more important to start using full
disc encryption, encryption at rest,
when you first get a device because that
way you can trust that even if parts of
the device degrade over time, all of the
data that's there and has been there was
at least encrypted with one of your pass
code passwords or one of your biometrics
in the past. So this is the kind of
feature too to look for in your Mac,
your PC or your phone to ensure that it
is somehow enabled. Thankfully, once you
log back in with your password, it goes
back to the original data and you can
use it. Of course, then an implication
of this best practice is that if you
lose your laptop or your phone or your
desktop's password or your fingerprint
somehow change or your face sufficiently
changes, you might be locked out of all
of your data too. But again, that's just
another example of this trade-off
between usability and security as well.
Now a downside an evil side to full disc
encryption is ransomware which is how
adversaries are monetizing attacks. It's
not uncommon nowadays for hackers, for
adversaries when they get into a system,
whether it's your laptop or for instance
a corporate network or in some cases
hospital systems or cities own computer
networks to not try to do any damage or
just do something like spam or
cryptocurrency mining, but to actually
uh encrypt all of the data on these
systems they somehow accessed online.
Why? Well, if they encrypt all of the
data, they can then ask for a ransom and
say, ""Listen, if you don't give me this
many bitcoins, I'm not going to give you
the key that I use to encrypt your
data."" And if you poke around online,
there have been many examples of this,
unfortunately, where hackers have gotten
into systems that were not very well
protected. All of the data therein was
encrypted. And this is an opportunity
for the adversaries to try to extort say
financial gain from a situation by then
only handing you the keys if ever once
you've actually paid up. And there too
there's the risk as in any ransom
scenario where who even knows if they're
going to give you the proper key uh in
the end. But this is increasingly a
concern for municipalities, for
companies, for universities and the
like. So just as we have some upsides
here, there too is this trade-off in
what you can do. And lastly, we thought
we'd end on a note about the future
because this is a topic that will come
up and has come up over time. This topic
of quantum computing. So for those less
familiar, we've been talking a lot about
bits, zeros and ones today. And at the
end of the day, that's how today's
computer systems are implemented.
Patterns of zeros and ones to represent
numbers and letters and colors and
videos and sounds and everything. We've
been discussing today, data more
generally. Now typically in our world
now a bit a binary digit can either be a
zero or it can be a one as per the
diagram we had on the screen in these
examples. Either a zero or a one. In the
world of quantum computing thanks to
some very fancy physics and quantum
mechanics in particular. It is possible
it seems physically for us to implement
the idea of bits a little bit
differently using quantum techniques.
And there's this idea of not just a bit
but a quantum bit or Qbit whose power
derives from the reality that physically
you can implement a cubit in such a way
that it is representing both a zero and
a one at the exact same time. So it can
be not in just one state, so to speak,
one condition at once, but two states at
once. And if you have two cubits, they
can be in four states at once. If you
have three, they can be in eight states
at once. If you have 32 of them, they
can be in four billion states at once.
Now, what's the implication of this?
Well, when we talk about cryptography,
when we talk about hashing, when we talk
about just very large numbers and trying
to figure out via brute force or some
other mechanism what some input to a
function was, if you have exponentially
more computing capabilities by not being
able to do one or two things at a time
with individual bits, but two or four or
eight or 4 billion things at once, it
stands to reason that if adversaries
have access to quantum computing, before
you and I do, then all of the security
you and I now rely on that we've talked
about today could suddenly become
insecure because we're trusting right
now that it's just going to take the
adversary a lot a lot a lot of time,
maybe money, maybe resources, maybe risk
to attack our accounts. But if they have
exponentially more resources than you
and me, then our data really is at risk
and all of the mathematics we've been
trusting need to be hardened instead.
Now hopefully you and I will have access
to quantum computing at the same time as
or ideally before all of these
adversaries. So hopefully our algorithms
for securing information will continue
to evolve along with these technologies.
So this isn't necessarily something you
need to worry about for now. Indeed, I
think after today we have more than
enough to worry about. So for today
that's all. We'll see you next time.
>> [music]
>> All right. This is CS50's introduction
to cyber security. My name is David Men
and this week let's focus on securing
systems, particularly those that are
somehow or even interworked as well. Now
recall from last time that we presented
encryption is really the solution to a
lot of our problems and that's going to
be a building block that we continue to
use to solve a lot of our concerns
around the security of not only our
accounts our data but now also our
systems for instance let's consider
something that you yourself are perhaps
using right now which is Wi-Fi somehow
connected via wireless technology to the
internet and beyond. So, probably by now
you realize that when you're on Wi-Fi,
you have to first choose your network.
And you might choose your network from a
drop-own menu on your computer or the
like, or it might auto select it. But
there's at least two types of networks.
One that are unsecured, and then two
which are secured in some way. And odds
are you recognize, and you've already
been taught through practice to
recognize the little padlock icon on
your phone or laptop or desktop as
signifying that your Wi-Fi connection is
indeed encrypted. Now, what does that
actually mean? Well, in particular in
this context, it would mean that any of
the traffic, any of the internet packets
of information, so to speak, like
envelopes of information going from your
device off onto the internet are somehow
encrypted, at least encrypted, until
they reach whatever device your device
is talking to wirelessly. So, you have a
a encrypted connection between that
wireless device, often called an access
point. Now, what is the actual
technology that's being used to secure
Wi-Fi networks nowadays? Well, hopefully
you're using among the latest versions
of this Wi-Fi protected access or WPA.
And this has evolved over the years and
there have been a few different
versions. And so, in general, whenever
you configure a phone or whenever you
configure a laptop or desktop, ideally
you're connecting to a device nowadays
that supports this technology and the
latest version thereof. And in a
nutshell, what that ensures is that
indeed your traffic from your phone,
laptop or desktop is somehow scrambled
between you and that other device. And
that device in turn is probably
connected to devices called routers.
Computers that route left, right, up and
down information on the internet, which
might then connect to other routers
until it finally reaches its
destination. So for our purposes though,
Wi-Fi protected access and using a
secure Wi-Fi network is only technically
encrypting your traffic between you and
whatever device is maybe on the wall, on
the ceiling, nearby, the little thing
with antennas perhaps that you yourself
are actually talking to. So why do we
care about this? Why do you want even
your Wi-Fi connection, for instance, to
be encrypted? Well, it turns out a lot
of what you and I do on the internet
isn't necessarily encrypted already for
us. Now, fortunately, this is
decreasingly the case. The world has
gotten better about using more and more
encryption in various products and
software and applications that you and I
use, but not necessarily because odds
are even some of you are probably in the
habit of typing httpwww.acample.com
or whatever domain you're actually
trying to visit. Now, maybe you don't
type even that, but you're certainly
familiar with this prefix, this acronym,
HTTP, which stands for hypertext
transfer protocol, which is a fancy way
of saying that this is a a protocol, a
language that computers use when talking
on the worldwide web or web for short.
So, what do we mean by that? Well, if
you're sitting down at a browser on your
phone or laptop or desktop and you're
visiting a URL that starts with HTTP,
your device is about to communicate with
some remote server using this protocol,
this language, really a set of
conventions for talking between each
other. But the catch is per last week
when we focused on the security of our
data, the information or the packets of
information that we're sending from
browser to server and back are
vulnerable to eavesdropping potentially
if you're only using HTTP. Well, why is
that? Well, HTTP by definition is is not
encrypted. It's just text messages often
English-like in nature, but they're not
at all scrambled. Which means if Alice
is sitting at her desktop or laptop or
phone and trying to visit some website
here represented as our friend Bob,
there could be some third party Eve
who's eesdropping in between a machine
in the middle so to speak that could be
looking at every request Alice is making
and every response that Bob is sending
if again Alice is the user in the story
and Bob is the web server in this story.
So you're vulnerable if you're only
using HTTP and certain other protocols
or technologies to these
machineinthe-middle attacks. And the
attack in this case might just be
someone nosily trying to know what it is
you are doing on the internet. But worse
they can even manipulate what you're
sending or receiving if these systems
are not using some form of encryption.
So let's take a a specific example. When
you visit a website on the internet, you
are downloading effectively a language
called HTML, hypertext markup language.
If you take a course like CS50 itself or
an introduction to web development,
you'll actually learn a language that
looks a little something like this. And
I've shown only the highlights using
ellipses here dot dot dot to wave my
hands at details that won't matter. But
this is the kind of text or language
that we get back from a server when you
visit something like httpwww.acam
example.com. But notice that this
doesn't seem to be scrambled. Even
though it might look cryptic to you if
you've never written or seen HTML
before, it doesn't look like random
zeros and ones. Certainly, it looks
pretty intelligible. And in fact, it
looks somewhat English-like with words
like body here. Well, the catch is if
this is the response coming back from a
web server to a web browser, for
instance, Alice's own, what could happen
is that some eavesdropper, some machine
in the middle could actually inject
additional HTML code into the web pages
that you and I and Alice are
downloading. Now, what is this
representative of? Well, this is another
feature you might learn in a course on
website development. But let me
highlight just one key phrase here
because this is a common use case. It is
possible therefore for a machine in the
middle to inject something like
advertisements or worse something
actually malicious that tries to steal
your data in some way. But a common
scenario for this machine in the middle
attack is when your internet service
provider or the coffee shop whose Wi-Fi
you're using or the hotel whose Wi-Fi
you're using wants to inject
advertisements into maybe each and every
web page you are visiting. Even if those
web pages weren't even designed to have
advertisements. These things might be
prepended to the very top of the page
for instance. Now the the reason that
machines in the middle are able to do
this though is simply because if you're
not using encryption and Alice and Bob
are communicating insecurely in that
sense. Well, there's no telling what
they could add to the responses that are
coming back from this web server. Let me
pause here before we move on to yet
other threats to see if there are now
any questions on this particular attack.
>> How to detect machine in the middle and
get rid of it?
>> A really good question. So, how can you
detect a machine in the middle and get
rid of it? That certainly should be a
worthy goal. Um, short answer is you
cannot necessarily detect it. It is
possible that a machine in the middle
can be doing all of this without your
own knowledge. um how do you get rid of
it? Well, that too is going to be the
focus of today. Namely, encryption is
going to help us push back on exactly
this threat. But first, let's consider
some additional threats or concerns that
we might have. And one of them
technically is called packet sniffing.
So again, a packet is the a virtual
envelope of sorts that you might use
when sending data on the internet. And
so in fact here is a pretty standard
envelope in which in the human world I
might put a letter and then write
something on the outside and send it off
to someone through the mail system.
Well, you can think of packets in the
context of computer systems as being
analogous to this whereby this is an
envelope whose purpose in life is to get
data from one point A to another point
B. So from Alice to Bob and inside of
this packet is the actual message that
Alice is sending to Bob and Bob is
hopefully sending back to Alice. So it
might not all fit in one packet. So
indeed the internet tends to use
multiple packets like these, but that's
an appropriate metaphor to think about
what it is we're doing here otherwise
digitally. So packet sniffing then is
kind of like trying to get a sense of
what's going on inside of these
envelopes. And indeed, if the contents
of these envelopes are not encrypted,
scrambled securely in some way, well,
then any machine in the middle can
technically take a quick glance inside
of these envelopes, so to speak, see
what's inside of them, even change
what's inside of them, as we've seen,
and then pass it along. So, what are the
implications for what this makes
possible? Therefore, if you are
vulnerable to packet sniffing by again
not having your systems use encryption
when they are talking to one another.
Well, here for instance is one example
of what could be inside metaphorically
an envelope like that. This is the kind
of message written mostly in English
that represents a browser requesting a
web page from a server. In particular,
when you visit a search engine, for
instance, and type into the search box
what it is you're searching for, maybe
you're searching for cats, what happens
is your phone or your laptop or desktop
creates a virtual envelope like that,
opens it up, puts inside of it a message
that looks like this, closes the
envelope, and then sends the envelope
off onto the internet to a web server
that conversely is going to open the
envelope, read this message, and
hopefully send you back a whole bunch of
search results about cats. Now, most of
this is arcane detail that we don't
particularly care about, including where
it is we're visiting for this story. I'm
using example.com is just something
generic, but you could imagine it being
Google or Bing or the like. Here you
have a command get, which means
literally get me a web page/ search is
implying that I'm searching for
something. But here's the interesting
part. What I'm searching for is a query
for cats where a query is a question or
a search uh request of you of yours. and
cats of course is what I'm searching
for. So this is to say inside of this
envelope whether you're searching for
cats or dogs or anything else there is
some mention of that search query inside
of the message inside of that envelope
that's being sent from Alice to Bob or
from you to Google or Bing. Lastly,
there's this mentioned here which is
referring to exactly the same protocol
HTTP. In this case, perhaps version
three. But in ultimately, it's the the
yellow highlighted text here, that
mention of cats, that's worrisome if
some machine in the middle, some
adversary can sniff this packet and see
what's going on inside. Now, there's
other threats similar in spirit. When
you request pages on the internet, you
don't sometimes just search for
information like cats, which I don't
really care about if people know since
everyone else on the internet is
searching for cats. But what if I'm
trying to check out on some website like
Amazon and buy something with a credit
card? Well, then what is inside of this
envelope is some text that looks fairly
similar. We still have a host in the
story of example.com. I'm still using
HTTP. I'm not getting information per
se. I'm posting information akin to uh
uploading my credit card to the server.
And in particular, down here is a
representative of how my credit card
might be stored inside of this virtual
envelope. And if I highlight that
indeed, you'll see a credit card number
that hopefully doesn't actually work,
but it is the right length. If anyone
sniffs this packet, they might actually
be able to find my credit card and maybe
my name and my address and the little
code that you need and more with respect
to whatever it is I'm checking out for.
So it's that easy if the data is itself
not encrypted. Let me pause here then
too and see if there are any questions.
>> If someone is performing an attack right
from a machine in the middle, does the
person actually have to be like
connected to the same Wi-Fi network as
you or they could be on a whole other
network?
>> A really good question. So in general
they would be connected to the same
Wi-Fi network so that they are uh in
general they would be connected to the
same Wi-Fi network but even that is not
necessary so long as they are within a
reasonable proximity to you and their
laptop or their device has an antenna
that can receive all of the wireless
packets that are around you. They don't
necessarily have to have access to that
same network especially if it's
unencrypted. And in fact there exists
software that can listen to all possible
networks that are around you. And so
that too um is a potential threat. Other
questions on this here.
>> Do people have to know your IP address
in order to be able to see what you're
doing or read what websites are going
to?
>> A really good question for those
unfamiliar. An IP address is a unique
identifier that every computer on the
internet has. Much like you have a
postal address to which humans can send
mail. Short answer, Mahal is no. like
the someone does not need to know your
IP address in advance for at least these
wireless attacks because they can simply
as per my other response um listen to
all of the wireless traffic nearby and
they can actually see the IP addresses
of senders and receivers flying by so to
speak throughout the air. So what's
another threat we should be mindful of?
Well, it turns out that most anytime you
visit a website nowadays, one or more
cookies are installed on your computer.
Now, what do I mean by that? When you
actually visit a website for the first
time, particularly one that you need to
log into and therefore that needs to
remember you when you click click click
on different pages, for instance, to
access different emails, add different
things to your shopping cart. What the
server actually does is a little
something like this. The server responds
to your request, for instance, after
logging in with an HTTP response that
first says 200, which is code for okay.
It's a so-called status code, similar in
spirit to the 404 you might have seen in
the real world, but 200 means okay. And
then it additionally sends this line of
text inside of a virtual envelope that
gets sent back to you. Set-ash cookie
colon and then this key value pair, so
to speak, a word like session, then an
equal sign, then a value. Now, in
practice, the value is actually pretty
big and random with numbers and letters,
but I picked something easier to
pronounce for today's purposes. 1 2 3 4
ABC D. And what this is similar to
actually is as though when you visit
this website, your hand is being
stamped. Right after you've logged in,
the server is now sending you browser
this piece of message to say the
equivalent of your hand has now been
stamped. And so the next time you click
on a link on that same website, it's as
though you present this handstamp again
and again and again, instead of having
to input your username and password
again and again and again. This is a
more seamless way supported by HTTP to
just remind the server, I'm still David.
I'm still David. I'm still David. By
having virtually stamped my hand and
that's implemented by way of this
cookie, so to speak. So the cookie is
exactly what's in yellow here. And a
session is just a concept that refers to
the ability of a server to remember who
you are. It's like your shopping session
in the context of a website like
Amazon.com where you might have a
shopping cart that you want to keep
adding things to. The website wants to
remember what's in your cart. Therefore,
the website needs to remember who you
are. Therefore, the website's going to
check your handstamp much like an
amusement park, a bar, or a club might
once you've already shown them your
ticket or your ID. Now, subsequently,
when your browser visits the same
website again and again, it of course
doesn't have a hand to show like this.
So rather it sends its own message via
HTTP inside of its own virtual envelopes
back to the server every time you click
another link, add something to your
cart, open a new email on the site into
which you've logged in. So here I'm just
getting the homepage of this server. U
then I'm sending not set cookie but
cookie. This is the textual equivalent
in HTTP of my presenting my hand with
that stamp. I'm sending the exact same
value as before. Session equals 1 2 3 4
abcd. That's how the server knows at
this moment in time that this is me
David and not you for instance even if
you have logged in separately on your
computer because you on your computer
would have a different value for this
cookie. Now this cookie might be
generally stored in memory temporarily
or it might actually be installed longer
term on your computer for a day for a
week a year depending on how the server
has been configured. But the catch with
these cookies, even though they do solve
a very useful problem of retaining
state, that is remembering who you are,
they make you vulnerable potentially to
what's called session hijacking. At
least if you're not using encryption,
that is HTTPS.
Because if you're using HTTP, all of the
contents of those envelopes, including
the set cookie line and the cookie line,
are just being sent back and forth in
the clear without any encryption at all.
Now, what's the implication of that?
Well, if an adversary is somehow
listening in on your internet traffic
wirelessly or via wires, and they see
your unencrypted HTTP traffic going back
and forth, and they see in this traffic
inside this virtual envelope, oh,
David's session cookie happens to be 1 2
3 4 ABC. There's nothing technically
stopping an adversary now from sending
its own request like this to that same
server but copying your cookie and
essentially pretending that that cookie
is the adversaries and not just mine.
The implication therefore logically is
that when I visit that website I might
still be logged in but when the
adversary visits that website by using
this technique they might be logged in
too but as me. So here too, the solution
really is just to ensure you're using
encryption, namely HTTPS in this context
to ensure that not only are all of the
contents of these message encrypted that
you care about going back and forth, so
are these lower level details that you
might not have even known about, namely
these cookies that are going back and
forth. Now, what is HTTPS doing for us?
Well, it's ensuring that the connection
between Alice and Bob is completely
encrypted, that is scrambled, so that
even if there are other machines in
between Alice and Bob, as there would be
on the internet, none of them should be
able to see what is inside of those
virtual envelopes going back and forth.
In fact, that's a good way to think
about it. Recall that as Alice sends one
of these virtual envelopes to Bob and
Bob might send a virtual envelope back
to Alice, there may very well be
identifiable information on the outside
like the IP address of Bob or the IP
address of Alice. But HTTPS ensures that
what's inside of the envelope is indeed
encrypted so that even if some other
machine in the middle intercepts one of
these virtual envelopes, they can't
understand what's inside of it. Now, how
is that done? Well, it turns out that
there's another protocol in the world
that handles precisely that process of
encrypting HTTP traffic, aka HTTPS. And
the most recent version of this protocol
is called TLS, which funny enough is
perhaps an acronym that many people have
still not heard of, but you might have
heard of SSL, which is essentially an
earlier version of it, but TLS is
essentially the new and improved version
of SSL and what modern browsers should
now be using. What does this do to go
about encrypting your traffic? Well, it
turns out it relies on our focus from
last time of public key cryptography.
And this principle that if you give two
parties A and B, each their own public
and private key using that, you can
solve that chicken and the egg problem
and actually communicate securely even
if in advance you don't have a shared
secret. So recall that asymmetric
cryptography allows us to establish a
secure connection even if you've never
visited some website or some app before
now. So what does it mean for a browser
to be using TLS and thus HTTPS
to communicate securely with a web
server? Well, the web server in this
story now has what we'll call a
certificate, a digital certificate. And
you can think of this for now is really
a public key that has been signed by
someone else. So the website has a
public key and a private key. And the
private key as always stays private. But
in this case, the web server has a
public key that's also been digitally
signed by some third party. And for now,
let's assume that there are some big
third parties out there, companies
really, that we all or at least the
browser manufacturers, the Googles, the
Microsofts, the Apples of the world, all
trust on our behalf. and they are the
ones signing off on the legitimacy of
these so-called certificates. Well,
these certificates technically are of a
type called X.509 if you're curious
about the type of protocol being used,
but this is just the standard format in
which these certificates live. But you
can think of a certificate really as
almost a printed piece of paper with
some interesting information on it like
the name of the website and how long the
certificate is valid for and also the
public key which we said last time is
really just a big number that has a
mathematical relationship with that
private key as well. Now who are these
big players, these big companies that
are doing the signing of these website
certificates? Well, you might have heard
this phrase at some point if you set up
your own website perhaps. These are
called certificate authorities or CAS
and these are a uh these are a
collection of companies and entities
whose purpose in life is to digitally
sign certificates and the various
browser manufacturers of the world.
Apple, Microsoft, Google, uh, Mozilla
and others have gotten together and
included in their browsers like Edge and
Mo and and Firefox and Safari and Chrome
a list of certificate authorities that
they trust. And if the idea is that if
you trust Apple and you trust Google and
Microsoft and Mozilla and other browser
manufacturers, then by transitivity, you
should trust any of the certificate
authorities that they in turn trust. So
what actually happens when your browser
visits a website? Well, it first
downloads the certificate from that
website, assuming you're using HTTPS.
Your browser then calculates a hash
value for that certificate by looking at
certain fields within it using a special
hash function that produces a fixed
length representation of the
certificate. Now why does it bother
doing that? Well, the next step that
your browser does is it does this. It
takes a look at the signature on that
certificate. It uses the certificate
authority who signed that certificate's
public key and then it uses that CA's
public key, the signature from that
server certificate, runs it through this
algorithm here, effectively decryting
the signature with the public key, and
that should produce the exact same hash
value. That is to say, if you visit a
server and it's presenting you with a
certificate and it says that that
certificate has been digitally signed by
a certificate authority, your browser
can use the certificate authorities's
public key to decrypt that signature and
by way of these hashes confirm or deny
that yes, that server certificate was
indeed signed by the certificate
authority. And again, if you trust
Google, if you trust Microsoft, Apple,
Mozilla, and that's another question all
to itself, but if you trust them and
they in turn trust these certificate
authorities, the presumption is that you
should trust your secure connection with
this particular website. Now, with that
said, does HTTPS and in turn TLS keep
you secure? Mathematically, yes. But you
and I as the humans are again the
potential weakness here. Why? There's
another attack called SSL stripping for
historical reasons, but now it refers
also to TLS. And what this attack
involves is tricking the user into
thinking they have a secure connection
to a website when they might actually
have not an encrypted connection to that
website. And worse yet, they might
actually have an encrypted connection to
a third party, a machine in the middle's
own website. So how might this work?
Well, if you and I are in the habit of
only typing still URLs as
httpwww.agample.com
or maybe you are and I and are in the
habit of just typing www.agample.com
enter into our browsers or maybe more
likely you and I are in the habit of
just typing example.com enter in our
browsers. Well, if you watch the URL
bar, the address bar in your browser,
you've probably noticed over time that
even if you type the most succinct of
those inputs, it eventually gets
converted converted into a longer URL
with the HTTP, maybe with the www and
perhaps even more characters as well.
And that's because your browser is just
trying to be helpful. Technically, to
visit a website, you need to use a URL.
And a URL in this case should start with
http slash or maybe https
slash. But your browsers are trying to
be helpful. So if you don't even type
any of those, it might first try HTTP
and then it might try HTTPS even. But
the catch is that if you start your
interaction with a web server using
HTTP,
that alone might be enough of a window
of opportunity for an adversary to do
something malicious with the packet of
information you're sending to the server
and then maybe send you back a response
that tricks you into ending up at some
other website altogether or perhaps just
the adversar's own website. and they
might be super clever and make you think
that you have a secure connection to the
original website that you visited. So
what do I mean by that? If inside of
your browser's virtual envelope is an
HTTP message like this, which is just
saying get me the homepage of
example.com, but suppose for the sake of
discussion that you are not using HTTPS,
you just typed HTTP or nothing at all
and you're trusting your browser to fill
this in for you. What might come back
from the server? Well, the server could
respond with a message that says this
HTTP version 3 uh 307, which is another
status code, which means redirect the
browser to a different URL. This is the
browser's way of saying detour. Go to
this other URL instead. Well, what
location is that URL at? Well, perhaps
this one here. But the catch is that if
you're using HTTP and therefore your
request is unencrypted and suppose for
this story that there is a machine in
the middle waiting there listening to
attack you. It could actually be that
this response is coming from that
machine in the middle and not the actual
website that you intended to visit. Why?
Because if Alice is trying to reach Bob,
but Eve, the eavesdropper is in the
middle, it could actually be Eve in the
middle that's responding with this
request. So Bob doesn't even know what's
going on in the story. But the catch is
here. Notice that this eavesdropper,
this machine in the middle is
particularly clever because they're
suggesting that you be redirected per
this status code 307 to https/.
And odds are you and I are probably in
the habit of at least making sure that
our browser says secure or that at least
you're at an HTTPS URL. So you might
think good, everything is the way it
should be. Now this is very very subtle,
but what if I draw your attention to the
actual URL I'm being sent to here? At
least on a US English keyboard using
this particular font, this is no
longer.com
exam ple. OM this is now indeed exam
p1e.com.
So this is a particularly subtle attack
whereby the adversary in this story
seems to have bought a domain name that
looks very similar to example.com with
an L, but they instead use the number
one which in some fonts and on some
screens looks so close to an L that are
you or I really going to even notice
this difference. The implication though
of this subtlety is that you might very
well have a perfectly encrypted
connection using HTTPS to a server, but
it's not Bob server in the story. It's
now Eve's server in the middle. So SSL
stripping in this case refers to an
attack whereby you're sort of stripping
out what would be an HTTPS redirection
to the right place and maybe you never
even end up at HTTPS and the
eavesdropper in the middle always keeps
it as HTTP but an even more malicious
adversary might take it one step further
and actually redirect you to their own
HTTPS site at which point you might be
vulnerable to the fishing attacks that
we've discussed before where you might
provide information into a website that
is not actually legitimate.
So, how can you mitigate this kind of
attack? Well, one, if you're a user, a
consumer, you could just get into the
habit of always typing out https
colon slash and then the domain name
that you want to visit. I will concede
that that can get tedious quickly, but
that is hands down uh the most paranoid
solution to implement here because you
know you will end up at HTTPS.
Hopefully, the website actually supports
HTTPS, but most websites nowadays
certainly do. With that said, if you're
on the flip side of the story and you're
actually the designer of the website,
the business owner running the website,
or you have control over not the
browser, but the server, there's a few
different things that you can do. And in
fact, you can use a protocol called
HSTS, which is to say, you can actually
configure your server to provide hints
to browsers that you know what they
should always use HTTPS when talking to
the server no matter what the human has
decided. And HSTS here or for hypertext
secure or strict transport security has
you as the administrator of the server
just configure your server to send an
additional HTTP header. That is to say,
an additional line of text inside one of
those virtual envelopes that just
informs the server that we really want
to be strict about our transport
security. That is, we want to be using
TLS. We want the user to be using HTTPS.
And here the server is telling the
browser, assume that this is the case
that I want you to use strict security
for at least one year. This is the
number of seconds in a 365day year, for
instance. That's just a really long time
telling the browser that yes, I'm going
to keep my security on for at least a
year, which should be the case anyway.
But you can further configure your
server to not just output this response
in every one of those virtual envelopes
going back to browsers. You can even
more protectively say use strict
security for subdomains as well. So even
if my user is atample.com,
also make sure that their browser uses
https for something like www.agample.com
example.com where in that scenario www
you can think of as a subdomain because
it's part of the example.com domain
itself. And so what is this telling the
browser specifically? Even though you
might accidentally conveniently visit a
website for the very first time using
http slash because you typed it or you
let your browser automatically fill that
for you. If the server responds with
this message, the whole point of HSTS is
that the second time, the third time,
the 300th time, the 3,000th time that
your browser visits that exact same
domain in the future up until at least a
year from now, it will automatically
switch you to HTTPS.
And it very protectively won't even let
you visit the HTTP, even if that's
what's in the URL bar. it's just going
to say, ""Nope, I've been told to use
HTTPS instead."" And that therefore
decreases the window of opportunity for
adversaries to just that very first
request that you might make
accidentally, conveniently that's using
HTTP, but every subsequent request from
your browser, according to this model,
will now be HTTPS
instead. And you can go one step
further, too. So, if you're the
administrator of a server, you can also
include the keyword preload in this
message that's inside of all of these
virtual envelopes. And what that will
further tell the world is that if the
browser manufacturers would like to
preload this information into Chrome
into other browsers that humans
download, you can even eliminate that
first window of opportunity because you
can have your domain name included
essentially in the source code for
browsers like Chrome. So that when
people download Chrome itself, visit
your website like exampample.com your
browser will already know that they
should not use HTTP with this website.
They should use HTTPS
questions then on HTTP on TLS on HSTS.
It's a lot of acronyms, but realize that
some of these defenses are available to
you as a user and some of you, if more
technical, these defenses are available
to you as system administrator. So you
mentioned that there is such websites as
exam1e.com
and they very similarly look to
example.com and I know that registers
fight against fishing websites like this
and whenever somebody tries to register
a domain that's looking a little bit
suspicious it usually marks it as fraud
and suspends it. So how do such domains
still exist and uh why is it so common?
That's a a really good question and
that's great that registars who are the
companies in the world that sell you or
rent you domain names nowadays are being
more vigilant when it comes to your
buying a domain that could be
maliciously used in this way because
it's so similar to a brand name or an
existing website. However, there's a lot
of registars out there and I would
conjecture that not all of them are as
good as others at doing that detection.
There are hundreds of top level domains
nowadays, TLDDS, which means that you
could even choose example something else
potentially and that too might not be
caught in this way. Now eventually maybe
especially when you use it maliciously,
you would eventually get shut down, but
maybe it's enough to attack one person
or two or 10 or 100 before it's actually
shut down. So these remain theoretical
and actual attacks. Um, but there are
certainly ways to push back on this. A
good question. Others from the group
>> I would like to know that is HTTP is the
best solution for cookies and super
cookies to prevent from attack or should
I um clear the cookies frequently?
>> A good question. Unfortunately, super
cookies
cannot be stopped at the browser level.
Super cookies refer to a type of cookie
that's embedded by your company, your
university, your internet service
provider, and you would have to opt out
at that level. So, for context, for
Americans in the group, um AT&T and
Verizon started doing this a few years
ago where they were injecting cookies
into cell phone customers HTTP requests.
you literally and stupidly and
obnoxiously have to log into your
verizon.com or your AT&T.com
account um in via the web or the app and
opt out of this. So wanting to your
question here, super cookies are
actually super annoying, super
difficult, super dangerous in that sense
because they can happen without your
knowing. However, if you are using
HTTPS,
that should decrease the probability of
this happening because if your data is
encrypted, your company, your
university, your internet service
provider can't insert the cookies into
those encrypted messages unless, and
we'll talk a bit about this more later,
unless you have given permission to your
company or university to install special
software on your Mac or PC.
So, in short, simplest advice is always
use HTTPS
and if you have a cell phone provider,
Google around, find out if they might be
doing this to you. Um, and if so, figure
out if you can opt out. How about one
more question here? Um my question will
be like from a macro perspective will it
be visible in the same way that there
are machine in the middle attacks
machine the middle verifications like
you know that on a request from let's
say my cell phone to the meeting right
now needs to do so many hops to reach
the server right will it be appropriate
if between each hop every packet will
get like a stamp like a passport to
verify the integrity of the connection.
>> Uh potentially the catch is and if I'm
understanding the question correctly,
the catch is you, I we, we don't control
all of these uh machines in the middle
when it comes to routers. So it's
possible to do what you're doing, but
there just isn't coordination at that
level. And so per our discussion last
week of endtoend encryption in general
it's best that the sender and receiver
worry about doing the encryption because
that way you don't have to trust anyone
in between you any machines in the
middle so long as you are um using um a
protocol that supports some form of
encryption end to end. So how else can
you keep your system secure particularly
when they're communicating with others?
Well, another technology with which you
might already be familiar is this, a VPN
or a virtual private network. Now,
whereas HTTPS
only secures your web traffic between
browser and server, a VPN is dare say a
more powerful technology because it
encrypts all of your internet traffic
between you and whatever VPN server to
which you're connecting. So, how does
this work? A VPN allows Alice and Bob to
establish a encrypted channel that even
if there are machines in the middle,
routers or otherwise, that shouldn't
matter because Alice and Bob are using
cryptography to en uh to encrypt all of
the information going in between points
A and B. Now, how might you use this?
Well, it's very common if you work for a
company that itself has servers that you
might need access to, whether it's email
or files or anything else, you might
from your laptop have to by policy at
that company connect to your company's
servers via VPN, virtual private
network. That is to say, your Mac or PC
or your phone have special software that
you start up. you probably log into
using minimally a username and a
password, maybe using a two-factor code,
maybe using a USB device that you have
to connect to your computer. You have to
somehow authenticate to that VPN. And
once that software is up and running and
authenticated against the VPN server
run, in this case by your company, all
of your internet traffic thereafter
should be encrypted between you point A
and the company point B. The motivation
for that is that this way the company
can ensure that no matter what services
you are accessing inside of the
corporate network be it email or files
or maybe video conferencing or something
else altogether no matter what by nature
of that VPN all of that traffic is
encrypted. But you should realize too
that VPNs have a few side effects
perhaps good perhaps bad. When Alice
connects to Bob, if Bob is the VPN
server, she has this encrypted tunnel.
This is what we mean by a private a
virtual private network, she has this
encrypted tunnel to Bob, which typically
makes it appear as though Alice's IP
address, her internet address, her
unique identifier on the internet, is
actually that of Bob and not her own.
That is to say, if Alice connects to her
company's VPN server, she then gets
another IP address from her company's
own VPN server effectively. So, if Alice
then visits gmail.com or Amazon.com or
any other website, those websites will
actually think that Alice's IP address
is that of Bob and not Alice. So, this
is very commonly used if you're in one
country and you want to masquerade as
though you're in another. And this might
be because you need to in order to
access company resources, perhaps from a
show of smiles. This might be because
you want to access a streaming media
service that you don't have access to
when you're in one country or another.
The point though is that you have this
encrypted connection between points A
and B and thereafter you can visit any
website, any service as though you are
physically at location B. Beyond that,
there are other technologies that you
can use to encrypt communications. And
this one's a little more technical and
used by uh programmers and system
administrators alike. There's a protocol
called SSH for secure shell. And this is
a technology via which you don't
necessarily encrypt all of your traffic
between point A and B, although you can
use SSH to create the equivalent of a
virtual private network or VPN. But SSH
is all about connecting to a remote
server and executing commands on it. So
not executing commands on your own
machine ultimately, but on some other
machine that's maybe inside of your
company, your university or somewhere
else in the world. So for instance, if
curious as to how this works, you might
recall that in a previous class I wrote
some code on my computer and then I
opened up a terminal window that started
with this prompt, a dollar sign. It
doesn't mean currency. It's just a
tradition that the dollar sign means
type your commands here. But at the time
I was typing them on my laptop here on a
local server, if you will. If I though
want to use a computer to remotely
connect to another and then remotely run
a command, it might work like this. Here
I am, let's pretend on my own computer
and suppose I type out one command like
the date command. If not surprisingly,
this will tell me what the current date
is. So suppose that where I am on my own
computer it is Thursday January 1st at
midnight Eastern time in the year 1970
for instance. If though the next command
I run is not date again but I use SSH
and I connect for instance to oh how
about our friends at Stanford
University. So I'm going to SSH into
Stanford.edu's
server. As soon as I'm at that server
now I get another prompt in this case.
But if I now run the date command, what
you'll see is that the date is now
apparently slightly in the past. At
least if I type this quick enough so
that the seconds weren't off. Wednesday,
December 31st, 900 p.m. Pacific time in
the year still 1969. So this is to say
SSH is actually a very common technology
used in the world of software
engineering, system administration, when
you want to control one server from
another. And what's powerful about it is
that everything I just typed after that
SSH command, even as innocuous as the
date command is on Stanford server,
would be encrypted. So no one between
these points A and B would be able to
know what I'm controlling or what
commands I have typed.
All right, let's go ahead and take a
fivem minute break and when we resume,
we'll look at some other building blocks
of systems that both solve problems but
also create vulnerabilities for us as
well. back in a few. All right, let's
talk about now what's actually been on
the outside of these virtual envelopes
that's helping these envelopes get from
their source to their destination. So,
it turns out that on the outside of
these envelopes minimally is what we'll
call a port number, which is literally
just a unique number that the world has
decided on that uniquely represents the
type of service that that envelope is
destined for. So, for instance, if you
at your browser were going to pull up a
website like httpwww.agample.com,
on the outside of that envelope would
not only be some mention of
www.agample.com,
but also a so-called port number, namely
80 by convention, which means that this
envelope should be opened not by the
other servers email server or chat
server, but by its web server
specifically. Now, if the web server
were to respond to us by saying, ""Uh-uh,
we want you to use HTTPS instead,
essentially redirecting the browser to a
secure version of the website,"" my
browser would then have to send a second
request to the server. This time, still
mentioning www.agample.com,
but on the outside of that envelope,
among other details, would be a
different port number, namely 443. Now,
these aren't the kinds of things you
might have to memorize, but the
computers certainly know what they
represent. And in fact, common numbers
include 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22
for SSH, and hundreds, if not thousands
of other numbers as well that humans
decided on, but the computers actually
rely on to know what piece of software
on a computer should actually expect and
open up these virtual envelopes, these
things we've called packets. So, what's
the problem or danger here? Well, it
turns out that your computer can be
listening for internet traffic on none
of these ports, in which case it's
completely disconnected from inbound
connections. But very often computers,
especially servers, are listening, so to
speak, for envelopes destined for maybe
port 22, maybe port 80, maybe port 443,
maybe others as well. So, you might
think, well, that's not great because if
these numbers are standardized, then
adversaries could maybe try to access my
server via those port numbers because
they too know what they are. So, you
might think, all right, well, let me run
my web server on a number other than 80
or a number other than 443 and just
choose a random number between like 0
and 65,000 or so because the odds that
the adversary is going to guess that are
much lower. SSH, you might consider
doing the same. But unfortunately, it's
all too easy for adversaries to wage
this kind of attack known as port
scanning. And recall that we did a our
own brute force attack in classes past
on our own passwords, for instance,
trying to figure out all possible
passwords that might be locking a phone.
And it's not that hard to use code very
much like that with a loop of some sort
that just tries every possible port
number between some range roughly 0 to
65,000. So port scanning refers to the
equivalent of accessing knocking on the
door of every possible port number on a
server. Now most of those doors might be
closed and no one might be home. That is
they might not be expecting any traffic
or visitors on those numbers. But by
writing software that tries all of those
port numbers, you can essentially
discover services that are running on
certain computers. Now hopefully that in
of itself is not a problem because most
likely the purpose of these services is
to be on the internet but hopefully
these services too are using encryption.
Hopefully they're using authentication
but that's not always the case. So
security through obscurity so to speak.
Running services on random or arbitrary
non-standard port numbers is not really
a good practice unless you're
additionally defending against all of
these common attacks. Now, in the world
of port scanning though, it's a it's a
specific example of what we might call
penetration testing more generally.
Penetration testing or pen testing is
actually a a skill, a technique, a job
even, whereby you are hopefully not an
adversary, but hopefully a well-paid
consultant whose purpose in life is or
whose vocation in life is to actually
try to penetrate someone's network or
penetrate someone's system. And what do
I mean by that? Well, maybe quite simply
you try scanning all of the ports on
their servers just to see if there are
ports that are open that is listening
that shouldn't be because no sense in
opening a door if no one's meant to go
through it. Or you might try to
penetrate their network or system in
some other way. Maybe you might try to
brute force your way through passwords.
Maybe you might try to socially engineer
the employees of that company or the
like. So penetration testing is all
about a someone who uh for good purposes
is trying to find possible weaknesses in
your infrastructure so that hopefully
you can pay them and thank them but then
fix those problems before actual
adversaries try to exploit it for
malicious purposes instead. So this
might also be referred to as ethical
hacking where you get all of the cache
of being a hacker and really good with
computers. But the upside of doing it
ethically, which is to say that if you
are in the business of trying to find
faults with systems, you don't have to
do it for uh for uh illegal financial
gain, but for very much legal financial
gain instead. as in someone will pay you
to find faults in their system so long
as you tell them and only them first so
that they can actually fix the same. And
in fact in this world there's a
gamification of it of sorts in certain
companies where you might have a red
team whose purpose in life in this game
is to actually try to penetrate the
network or find some faults and then the
blue team so to speak whose purpose in
life in the story is to defend the
systems against those attacks. And so
that too has often yielded better
results for some folks given that it
helps them find weaknesses before
adversaries who don't work for them do.
So how might you keep these attacks out
and how might you keep even penetration
testing out in a good way to demonstrate
that you know what we are actually
pretty secure? Well there's this
technology with which you might be
generally familiar by name namely a
firewall which actually comes from the
real world. Typically in buildings that
might have multiple stores, there might
literally be a firewall between two of
the stores so that if there's a fire in
one store, it doesn't somehow propagate
next door to the other store. Now, in
the virtual world, a firewall is
essentially a piece of software between
you and some the outside world or
between you and some other network that
keeps data in the network that you don't
want to leave it and it keeps out from
the network data that you don't want
coming in. So for instance, if you might
within your company or university or
home have some sort of local chat
service or intercom system or the like,
none of that traffic ideally should end
up on the public internet. So you might
want your firewall to block any
intentional or accidental attempts to
transmit that data outside the network.
Conversely, if you have a private
network that you only use for home
computing and watching streaming media
and the like, you are not yourself a
server and you certainly don't want
random on the people trying to connect
to your laptops or desktops or servers
in your home. You might want your
firewall to keep all internet traffic
out. Now, with that said, there are some
problems when you want to use services
where you do need to talk to someone on
the outside world, maybe like a Zoom
call or the like, but there are
technologies that help mitigate this. So
these firewalls are not necessarily
absolute. You can open them up or poke
holes in them so to speak to allow
certain services through. So how might
these firewalls actually work? Well,
they might simply block traffic that is
internet packets based on IP address.
Because recall on the outside of those
virtual envelopes is not just port
numbers but also and not quite the
domain name like www.agample.com.
on the outside of those envelopes is
actually the unique address of a server
to which you're sending a packet and the
unique address of a uh client that is
expecting some response there too. So an
IP address is just a numeric unique
address for let's say every computer on
the internet. It's a bit of a
simplification but it's very similar to
the postal addresses that you and I use
to send mail old school style or
postcards throughout the postal system
as well. So you could quite simply if
you as a parent for instance don't want
your kids accessing social media within
the home, you could just configure your
home's firewall to prevent access to the
IP addresses of known social media
sites. And so if the uh the kids are
trying to use the laptops or desktops in
the home to connect to those IP
addresses, it would effectively be
blocked and not allowed through so long
as the software in question, the
firewall can knows or can figure out
what those IP addresses are. Now that
said, it's not failproof. All it takes
is for someone in the home to have some
outofband device like a cell phone that
uses the mobile phone network and then
of course you circumvent the firewall
that might be based only on your home
network. So you have to keep in mind
exactly what it is you are firewalling
and which networks they're in. Now you
might not want to block access to sites
based solely on their IP address, but
perhaps based on those port numbers. So,
for instance, if you wanted to block all
internet traffic in or out of a network,
you could just use your firewall to
block all of those port numbers. But if
wait a minute, you realize that you
still want to be able to remotely
control a computer or server in that
network, you could open up just one port
number, for instance, 22 if you want to
allow SSH back and forth or whatever
port number your preferred VPN software
uses instead. So you can use firewalls
to block traffic based on IP address,
based on port number, or even more
sophisticatedly via deep packet
inspection, which is a big way of saying
that even the mo the most sophisticated
of firewalls can actually open up
theoretically these virtual envelopes
and see what's actually inside them. And
this way you can even more uh reliably
block certain sites by their domain
name, not just their IP address, but by
their name. You could, for instance, via
deep packet inspection keep an eye out
as to who is emailing whom. For
instance, corporations that are very
concerned about their intellectual
property uh ideas and products that they
have internally. They might use deep
packet inspection to make sure that you
and I are not emailing the press about
some new product under development or
emailing the competition or anyone in
the outside world about some product.
Because via deep packet inspection, you
can pretty much look at everything
inside of this envelope, be it the
sender, the receiver, the contents of
the message. But you can also use this
too not just for confidentiality and the
like, but also for instance to check for
malware and malicious software. that is
to say maybe attachments that you don't
want to allow through and we'll consider
exactly what those threats might be in
just a moment as well. Now, how might a
company, a university or even a home
implement this kind of firewalling or
more deeply this deep packet inspection?
Well, we're essentially describing a
technology that you would call a proxy.
And a proxy is very often a server,
though it doesn't have to be an actual
physical server, can be a piece of
software running in your network. A
proxy is a device that essentially
implements a potential machine
inthe-middle attack, but it's not quite
an attack in this way. It's by design. A
proxy is a device, a server or piece of
software that sits between two other
points. So in this case, Alice might be
someone on the inside of a network. Bob
might be someone on the outside of a
network. And Eve in this case is
eavesdropping literally because her role
in this story is to be that of a proxy.
And the proxy takes data from one side
and ideally maybe hands it out to the
other. But this proxy might indeed be
eavesdropping, might be a little nosy.
And so as a packet comes in this way
from Alice might look in the packet and
decide uh-uh we're not going to send
this to Bob. And then it might just be
dropped or effectively deleted. So
companies, universities, even home
networks can use proxies to decide yes
or no whether or not to allow certain
traffic through. So in that sense,
they're very similar to a firewall, but
sometimes proxies are something that
have to be configured even for your own
devices because there might be only one
path out of a company network, only one
path out of a university. But the catch
here is that literally all of that
traffic by design now is going through
this middle point. And here's where
things can get troubling, especially if
you do attend a university or you do
work for a company where they may be
issued your laptop or desktop or phone.
So if your company or your school has
given you a laptop or desktop or phone,
you know, that might be nice that this
is one of the perks to have this
hardware, but if they have preconfigured
it with software, realize that there are
implications of that. You might have
your own username and password on that
laptop or desktop or phone, but they
might have installed administratively
with root access, so to speak, some kind
of software that could actually be
monitoring everything you're doing on
that computer. And this is not uncommon
in the corporate workplace, but they can
also do things more technically like
they could install their own certificate
authority on your laptop or desktop or
phone. Essentially adding to the list of
certificate authorities that Microsoft
and Google and Apple and Mosilla have
baked into their own browsers. The
implication of this is that even if you
think that you as Alice can securely
communicate with Bob and maybe Bob in
this story is gmail.com or amazon.com or
facebook.com even if you think that
Alice and Bob can you Alice can
communicate securely with Bob and
establish a connection between
httpsgmail.com
if your browser that is your phone or
laptop or desktop has a certificate
installed by your company or university
that's acting as a CA or certificate
authority. Essentially, your computer
could be tricked into thinking that
you're connecting to the real gmail.com,
but you're actually connecting to the
company's proxy server. But because you
have this additional certificate on your
computer, even though the company is
masquerading, pretending to be
gmail.com, you're actually connected to
their proxy server and they might
actually be forwarding your traffic
somewhere else. But this is a definition
of a machineinthe-middle
attack, but it's facilitated by someone
else having used our technologies that
we talked about earlier to trick really
your local device into thinking that
this is the real gmail.com whereas the
math might actually be based on the
company certificate, not on gmail's own.
So be mindful of that again whenever
you're using a device that has left your
control or has not always been under
your control that you do not necessarily
know what is installed on it. So how
else might a company a university be
observing or keeping an eye out either
for good or evil purposes? Well, they
actually might also be doing something
that we might call URL rewriting. So if
you have a company or school email
address via which you receive mails from
the outside world, you might notice that
whenever an email contains a link, if
you hover over the link and look in like
the bottom corner of your browser, it
might actually not go to the actual link
destination that you think it does. It
might actually go to a URL like this.
Maybe httpsacample.com
question mark URL equals something. And
the implication of this here is that
what companies and schools might do to
combat malware, maybe malicious uh
software that could be accidentally
installed or or sent your way via URLs
or to prevent you from accessing fishing
websites that are trying to steal your
or the company or the school's
information. They might automatically
through some kind of proxy server acting
in this case on email change every URL
in an email you receive to be
example.com and then embed at the end of
that example.com URL the actual URL so
that you can still reach your
destination. But the implication of this
is that if you click on this link here,
you're first going to visit example.com.
That's going to include some data from
that proxy server that has added URL
equals something where something might
be gmail.com, amazon.com, whatever the
actual URL is. But because the company
or the school in the story controls
example.com, they know what URL you're
trying to visit. Now, one, they could
minimally just log that information and
know that, oh, David seems to be
visiting Gmail again. or they could
actually check in their database is
gmail.com or whatever this URL is known
to be malicious is it known to be a
fishing website and they can just
prevent you from accessing it altogether
so this is another form of proxying
that's actually very explicit because
you're embedding the machine in the
middle quite literally as exampample.com
or whatever your university or your
company's domain name is but it's all
toward an end of trying to help protect
you from potentially malicious
uh fishing type websites. But the
implication too is that now the company,
the school, the machine in the middle
knows every link you're clicking on as
well. Let me pause here and see if there
are now any questions about these
techniques of proxying. I just want to
know what's the difference between VPN
and also tour network in a higher level
like you know just the difference
because what I do know is that these two
networks are used to encrypt or
anonymize our activity or you know the
data that we are sending. The second
question is that let's say that I'm
using a network at a university or a
company and they also have their own you
know CA uh which means that they've got
their own databases like which websites
I can get in and which websites I cannot
get into. If I'm using VPN does that
mean that you know the university or the
company know what I'm doing?
>> Good question. So tour is the
anonymization software I was alluding to
a moment ago in my previous answer and
we'll talk about that in our final
lecture. Tour really is about privacy
preserving. So it's about covering your
track so that kind of like the Hollywood
movies when you're here your data is
bouncing sort of across all of these
different servers in the world and it's
sort of difficult to trace it back to
its origins by design. So more on that
in a couple of weeks time. VPN is an
encrypted connection just between one
point A and another point B. So even
though they can't see what you are
doing, it is very obvious where your
data is coming from thereafter. So
legally, for instance, if the VPN server
or company were to be subpoenaed, they
might have to disclose information about
you. And so it's not quite as privacy
preserving. It secures your data, but it
doesn't preserve your privacy in the
same way. Um, on your other question
about what you're doing, especially when
you're on a VPN, if you if someone has
installed with administrative privileges
software on your computer, like all bets
are off. You should not cannot trust the
device. So if they've installed their
own certificate on your computer or a CA
to the list of trusted things um anytime
you use that browser for instance like
you are vulnerable to a machine in the
middle attack or at least a proxying uh
type implication. Um beyond that and but
honestly at that point if they've
installed special software on your
computer they could be monitoring
everything you do on the internet
anyway. So sort of all bets are off. So
what is it we're trying to keep
ultimately out of our systems? Well, I
dare say malware is perhaps one of the
biggest threats. So malware or malicious
software is just software that someone
has written that can do malicious
things. And that's sort of the nature of
software. If you've never programmed
before, it turns out that it's not that
hard to write a program that if you run
it like deletes all of the files on your
computer or maybe starts sending out
spam or maybe starts mining Bitcoin or
anything else. Like software can do
anything and whether it's malicious or
not is really up to the human who wrote
it or the person who's using it. Now you
might have heard of specific types of
malware. For instance, a virus. A virus
is a piece of software that attaches
itself to a host just like in the human
physiological world. The catch with a
virus in the digital world is that you,
the human, usually have to do something
to get infected. You have to open a file
that's infected with the virus and start
running it on your computer and loading
it into your computer's memory and CPU
or brain. You have to click on an
attachment in an email that's perhaps
infected. So viruses generally require
human intervention and really human
mistakes. You're exposing yourself
unintentionally to a piece of software
that can now do anything. And a virus
can literally do anything that a piece
of software can. So it can delete all
the files on your hard drive. It can
send spam. they can start Bitcoin
mining, can email all of your files to
an adversary. Like once you have a piece
of software running on your computer,
all bets are off. So that you might
wonder then, well, what's the line
between a virus and like Microsoft Word
or some Spotify or some other piece of
software you install on your computer? I
mean, really, it's ethics at the end of
the day. We are trusting that Microsoft
Word and Spotify and other software you
might install on your Mac, your PC or
your phone just isn't doing bad things.
Because very often once you have a piece
of software on your computer, it
technically can do anything that the
operating system, Windows or Mac OS or
iOS or Android make possible thanks to
those manufacturers. And it really is a
code of ethics. It really is perhaps
capitalistic pressures that ensure that
companies aren't necessarily infecting
us with software that's doing bad
things. Why? Probably bad for business
if nothing else if they're caught doing
something malicious. But with that said,
for historically, it's quite possible
for software to be written even within
the constraints of an operating system
that does bad things. And heck, maybe
it's even accidental. It has absolutely
been the case that sometimes software
deletes things that it shouldn't because
some human made a mistake. Now with that
said, gradually the world is getting
better at designing better and better
operating systems that try to sandbox
things. And iOS, which runs on iPhones
and iPads and the like, is actually
particularly good at this, whereby
sometimes annoyingly apps can't do
something without your explicit
permission. Now, you and I might not
give much thought to just saying, ""Okay,
okay, okay,"" because we want the
software to do its thing. But more so
than operating systems past, you and I
are increasingly being allowed to weigh
in on whether some piece of software can
use the network, can turn on the camera,
can turn on the microphone. So
thankfully, we're getting more and more
building blocks to mitigate some of
these concerns. But there are still
viruses in the world and you can be
infected by them, whether it is some
file you've downloaded and run or some
email attachment you've clicked. But
more worrisome is another type of
malware that we might call a worm. And a
worm is very similar in spirit to a
virus in that it's just malicious
software. It can do anything. But these
things can travel from computer to
computer even without interaction by
humans. Now how does this work? Well, a
worm theoretically once it's installed
on one computer having infected it and
running, well, it could do that
technique called port scanning from
earlier and maybe it can use that
infected computers internet connection
and just start scanning the local
network or a broader network for IP
addresses of other computers and ports
of other computers. And if one of those
computers ports happens to be listening
and for for uh unfortunate reasons that
computer is not using encryption, it's
not using authentication and it's
vulnerable somehow. Theoretically that
worm can travel from computer to
computer to computer by making these
network connections via these ports at
these IP addresses. And that is quite
often how they have spread. It's the
result of mistakes in software. It's the
result of there having been holes in our
firewalls, in our systems by allowing
them through via these techniques. So,
what's the downside really? Well, beyond
just wreaking havoc on your own computer
by deleting all of your files, spamming
people, Bitcoin mining and the like,
actually, what adversaries have
increasingly been doing over the years
is creating botn nets, so to speak. that
is, it turns out it's more valuable to
an adversary not to completely disable
your system because that doesn't really
serve them long term, but maybe to
install software on your computer that's
just constantly running and it's not
actually doing anything bad to you. None
of your files are deleted, no spam is
being sent, but you are infected and
there's just some piece of software
constantly running on your computer. But
maybe this adversary has somehow figured
out how to infect not just your computer
but my computer and your computer and
your computer and your computer and
hundreds thousands of other computers in
the world. Now, if this software is
smart and it's constantly listening for
commands, an attacker can send some kind
of commands, not unlike those virtual
envelopes, to this entire botnet of
computers and say, ""Okay, computers, now
everyone at the same moment start
attacking some server or everyone at
this moment start sending emails.
Everyone at this moment start mining
Bitcoin."" And so you can leverage the
network of hundreds or thousands of
computers all at once and have a much
more powerful attack therefore possible.
And what form do those attacks take?
Well, quite often what we'd call a
denial of service attack or DOS. And
this is exactly as the name suggests.
Sometimes adversaries goal in life is
just to deny service to everyone else.
Whether it's for political reasons,
financial reasons, or the like. It's one
thing for me on my laptop or my phone to
maybe visit uh maybe I'm a little
annoyed at Google today. So, I go to
google.com and then I keep hitting
reload, reload, reload, reload or
faster, reload, reload, re reload. I'm
trying to deny service to other people,
but realistically, Google has way more
resources than me. So, a denial of
service attack only really works if you
have a lot of resources yourself, more
resources than the the site you're
attacking. But with botn nets, when you
control multiple computers, you can
actually wage a distributed denial of
service attack whereby again you send a
command to this whole network of
infected computers and you say, ""All
right, everyone, go visit google.com
right now and reload, reload, reload.""
And when it's hundreds or thousands of
computers doing it to Google or maybe
not someone as big as Google, but maybe
a small business that they're annoyed at
or they're com competing with, you can
via distributed network try to deny
service to actual customers or users of
that site. Why? Well, a computer, long
story short, only has so much memory,
only can do so much per unit of time.
And if you completely distract a
computer or server by all of these
requests that are sort of bogus, then
the good requests from the real users,
the real customers can't necessarily
squeeze in. And so you're denying
service to other people. And distributed
is particularly malicious. Why? Well,
once a company figures out what's
happening like Google, they could just
block with their firewall my IP address,
for instance, coming from my phone or my
laptop or other device. Once they know
where the attack is coming from, they
can just deny or they can block service
there. But if it's distributed, if it's
coming from all of us or thousands of
people, thousands of IP addresses, then
it gets a little harder. Like
technically they could just block all of
our IP addresses, thousands of IPs. But
very often you and I share IP addresses.
If we're on the same campus, on the same
corporate network, even though locally
we might have unique addresses, to the
outside world, we might all share one
public address from our whole company or
school. And at some point, it's not
going to be in Google's best interest in
the story to block all of those IP
addresses because then we might be
denying service to actual good people on
this campus, at this company, who just
happen to be on the same network as this
attacker or as this infected computer.
And so that's really the value of
attacking computers nowadays. It's not
just one thing to get at your computer
individually. It's what your computer
represents. You are a node, a potential
ally on a network of systems. So it's
just as well that we try to keep this
kind of software out altogether instead.
So how how do you keep it out? Well, for
years you've probably heard about maybe
you've been using antivirus software and
that's exactly what it does. Antivirus
software, software you either download
for free, maybe pay for, install on your
computer, and it's generally constantly
running or maybe it runs on a schedule
to check, are there any known viruses or
worms on this computer? And if so, let's
delete them or let's somehow remove them
safely and maybe you have to reboot to
get them out of memory, but then maybe
you're back in business. To be fair,
that might be too late because the
emails, the spam might have been sent,
the files might have been deleted, but
it at least gets it out of there for uh
the future time at least. But there's a
problem with antivirus software alone in
that it has to actually be current for
the attacks that you're facing. That is
to say, the antivirus software to work
has to know about the virus, has to know
about the worm. Now, how can you make
sure you're always current? Well, you
can enable automatic updates with your
antivirus software or even your
operating system more generally. And in
recent years, the world has kind of
realized that even though there are
downsides of automatic updates, it's
generally proving to be, it seems, a net
positive for society. Why? because it
ensures that you and I and everyone else
are generally running the latest
versions of software which generally
means we've fixed security holes that is
security related bugs in previous
versions so that at least we're not
vulnerable to yesterday's mistakes you
know we're still vulnerable to today's
and tomorrow's mistakes when people
continue to write software that's buggy
but at least we're staying current. This
also ensures too that companies can
focus their resources generally on the
newest versions of software and they
don't have to worry about being
backwards compatible and spending time
and effort and distraction on software
that might be older and older and older.
So enabling automatic updates is
generally proving to be a good thing I
dare say. But there are downsides. you
know, Google, Microsoft, Apple, and
others, they're not perfect, and it is
definitely been the case that they or
companies have released an update that
actually breaks your computer or mine in
the sense that now I can't access it or
something went wrong. And so, generally,
automatic updates are not something you
do to all of your customers all at once,
but maybe a few, then a few more, and
just to make sure that we're not going
to break or brick a whole lot of our
users computers. But generally speaking,
turning on automatic updates will at
least ensure that you're not vulnerable
to problems the world has already
solved. And this is a good thing because
there's nothing worse than realizing,
oh, I've been attacked and there was
something you could do about it. You
could have updated your software
already. But the catch is that there are
also these attacks known as zeroday
attacks. And the problem with antivirus
software in general and even automatic
updates is that there's still humans
involved in this process whereby they
have to realize, oo, there's a new virus
in the world. Ooh, there's a new worm in
the world. Ooh, we made a mistake. You
have to fix it. You have to update the
antivirus software to detect those new
threats or those uh those new viruses,
those new worms. So, a zero day attack
is an example of attack where an
adversary maybe writes their own virus,
their own worm, gets it out into the
wild, maybe on enough computers that
they can do something particularly
destructive or valuable for them with
it, and the world just doesn't have time
to catch up. So, even if you have
antivirus software installed, automatic
updates, might still take a day, a week
for the companies who design that
software to update those products for
you. So even then, you're still
vulnerable. And that's why security
really is going to be this multi-pronged
approach, especially when it comes to
our systems. It's not enough to just use
antivirus software. It's not enough just
to have a good password. It really is a
layered defense so that you create this
gauntlet of defenses ultimately that
adversaries have to get through. And if
they get through one, hopefully you're
fine. If they get through two, hopefully
you're still fine. If they get through
three, maybe then you should start
worrying. But security really isn't this
absolute. Recall from where we began, we
really just want to raise the bar, raise
the cost, raise the the risk to the
adversary so that again they hopefully
lose interest in in little old me. So
that's it for today's focus on systems.
Hereafter we'll focus on software
specifically on what you can do whether
you use or write software and thereafter
we'll take a turn to privacy as well.
All that next time.
All right, this is CS50's introduction
to cyber security. My name is David Men
and this week let's focus on securing
software. Whether it's the software you
use or whether it's the software you
write as a programmer. Consider for
instance one of our topics from earlier
in the class, namely fishing. This
attempt by an adversary to fish or
obtain information from you. Let's
consider today how you might go about
implementing this kind of attack and
equivalently how you as the user might
go about noticing an attack like this.
Well, here again is a language called
HTML, hypertext markup language, and
it's the language in which web pages are
written. This is maybe the simplest
example that we could put together that
represents the kind of text that a web
server would send to a web browser when
it wants to display information on your
screen, be it the day news, your email
inbox, or anything else that is web-
based. dot dot dot is where I've put
placeholders just to represent where
some additional code might actually go
like the content of this actual web
page. Well, for instance, suppose that
we consider in the abstract just a
simple example of these so-called tags.
And in fact, recall that everything that
you just saw sort of had these open
brackets but also the same words again
and again. For instance, if we wanted to
have a paragraph in this language called
HTML, we would have this thing here
called a tag or an open tag or a start
tag and then this thing here at the end,
a end tag or a close tag. And those are
meant typically to be symmetric. This
one sort of begins a thought for the
browser. Hey browser, here comes a
paragraph. And this one here with the
forward slash inside of those angled
brackets means, hey browser, that's it
for the paragraph. So anytime you see
HTML in a file, it's really telling the
browser what to start doing and what to
stop doing. So here is how a browser
therefore might know that it needs to
display a paragraph of text, maybe
separated by some whites space by other
paragraphs of text. Here, for instance,
is how a browser might know that there's
some code inside of the web page,
typically written in a language called
JavaScript. So this script tag opening
here and this closed script tag here
would be hey browser here's some code to
execute dot dot dot and hey browser
that's it for the code to execute. So
how might there actually be a threat or
an opportunity here for an adversary to
fish information from you? Well here for
instance is how you might in this
language called HTML create a link
otherwise known as a hyperlink in a web
page and it too uses an open tag and a
close tag. This a tag represents an
anchor like anchor some hyperlink some
link in the web page right here and this
tag here means okay that's it for the
link and if we want to link for instance
to Harvard's website in between that
open tag and close tag would you
actually put the text of what the link
is meant to be so if you want the user
to see a link on the page that says
Harvard you would put literally Harvard
between this open tag and close tag but
that's not actually enough to link to
some other page you have to tell the
browser what URL or what file you want
clicking on Harvard to actually lead the
user to. So for that we need to
introduce one other concept in this
language called HTML namely an
attribute. So Href stands for hyper
reference and it's a fancy way of saying
this is what I want the browser to link
the user to when they click on that word
Harvard. Now at the moment I've just
done a dot dot dot but that would for
instance be the URL of Harvard's own
website. So consider this very specific
example now whereby we still have our
anchor tag opening here. We still have
our anchor tag closing here. We now have
though an href attribute that's telling
the browser that when the word Harvard
is clicked, I want the user to end up at
httpsh
harvard.edu.
So that all seems fine and good and this
is the way the web is supposed to work
and this is what links in your own web
pages will look like if you poke around
underneath the hood. So where's the
actual danger? Well, hopefully there is
none. And hopefully when you open this
kind of HTML in the context of a larger
file with even more tags than just this
anchor tag, you'd see a browser window
that looks a little something like this.
You'd see a link typically underlined,
though not necessarily to Harvard. And
then and only then if you hover over
that link can you see where you will go
even if you don't actually click the
link. So suffice it to say if you just
click the link you're going to end up on
Harvard's own website. But if you a
little more cautiously with a bit more
paranoia, a bit more consciousness now
of cyber security hover over that link
and focus in your browser's bottom
lefthand corner typically at least on a
laptop or desktop, you'll actually see
the URL to which you will actually be
whisked away when you click on that
link. So this actually looks okay. The
word here is Harvard. The URL it's going
to link me to is https/harboard.edu.
So, I think all is well in the world.
And indeed, you can do this on most any
web page on your laptop and desktop if
you want to proactively, preemptively
see where it is you're going to go
before you actually click on that link.
So, where's the danger? Well, let's get
a little more specific and a little more
malicious if I may. So, here we have the
exact same HTML as before, but let's go
ahead now and not just say Harvard
inside of this open tag and close tag.
Suppose that for whatever reason I want
the user to see a little more obviously
the URL to which they are going to be
linked. So I might change Harvard
capital H to harvard.edu.
So the actual domain name that I want
the user to be led to. Here is now what
the user would see. So it's a little
more obvious that it's harvard.edu and
not some other Harvard website. And
indeed if we hover over that we'll see
that it still is going to the same URL.
All right. So that seems fine. and it's
not all that enlightening. Let's go one
step further. Suppose that you really
want the user to see a URL in the body
of the web page. So now I'm actually
going to put in between the open tag and
the closed tag https/harboard.edu.
Now notice this looks a little redundant
and it is in some sense because I
literally have the URL in two different
places, but that's because those two
values serve different purposes. is the
one in between the open tag and closed
tag is what the human sees. The one
inside of the quote marks the so-called
value of the href attribute is where the
user will actually end up. So if you
want them to be equivalent, you have to
type the exact same thing twice in this
case. So now of course if I go back to
the web page, the human is now going to
see literally this URL. And if they
hover before clicking, they'll see
confirmation as much. So where are we
going with this? Well, here's among the
lessons of the course is to think about
now how can you take a perfectly
reasonable technical solution to a
problem creating a link in a page in
this case and how might an adversary
abuse it? How might you as the end user
be vulnerable in this case to a
so-called fishing attack? Well, there's
nothing stopping me from putting
anything I want in either this value or
in this name of the link. So, you know
what? Why don't I be a little malicious
here? And why don't I tell the user that
they're going to Harvard.edu, but
they're actually going to yale.edu
instead, another school down the road.
So, what does the human see now? Well,
if we go back to the browser, they still
see what appears to be
https/harboard.edu.
But if they hover over it, and only if
they hover over it, will they see this
little clue that uh-uh, you're actually
going to be whisked away to yale.edu.
And if they click on the link, they'll
actually find themselves at the actual
yale.edu website. So what's the big
deal? Well, this might just be a silly
prank, in which case it's probably
inconsequential.
And if you do link from one website to a
completely different one, it's not
necessarily a fishing attack. It might
be confusing because the user thinks
they're going to Harvard, but they find
themselves at Yale, but there's not
necessarily any danger in that mislead.
But what if the adversary in this case
doesn't link to a very common popular
website like yale.edu, but maybe a
website like harvard.edu where just one
of the characters is slightly misspelled
as we've discussed in the past. Just
that you and I, unless we really really
look carefully, we might not even notice
that we're not at the real Harvard.edu.
And what if further the adversary went
through the trouble of copying all of
the HTML that implements Harvard's
website and pastes it into their own
fake version of Harvard's website that
lives at again a URL that is almost the
same. Here is now where there's a
fishing opportunity because if you think
you're going to harvard.edu and you
click the link and it looks like you're
at harbor.edu edu and you don't notice a
subtlety like wait a minute that's not
quite the right URL, you might now be
inclined to and comfortable with maybe
logging in to the fake harvard.edu
website with your username and your
password and voila, now the adversary
has that information from you. And it
doesn't have to be Harvard. It doesn't
have to be Yale. It might be your bank.
It might be PayPal.com or something
where you could actually lose money or
some other asset you care about. And so
that's really the essence of the
implementation details of a fishing
attack at least in the context of web
pages andor emails. It all boils down to
these primitives of HTML being the
language in which web pages are written
and adversaries by knowing HTML also now
logically can uh misuse HTML by
understanding how these basics work. So,
let me pause here and see if there's any
questions about fishing or HTML or this
convergence of the two when it comes to
this form of social engineering as we
called it before.
>> Would it be possible to write my IP or
some other means to get to their website
uh and not the URLs?
>> Short answer, yes. If you have access to
dedicated IP addresses, which are these
unique identifiers you can use for
servers on the internet, you can
absolutely have a URL that is like http
colon slash and then the IP address.
Now, typically it would be http and not
https when using an IP address, in which
case that might be a clue to the user
that wait a minute, this is making me
nervous, that this isn't legitimate. But
honestly, I think we can all think of
people in our lives who wouldn't have
the instincts to notice, wait a minute,
what is this weird numeric address in my
browser bar and stop what they're doing.
That's indeed among the goals of the
class like this is to give you those
instincts and that training to be a
little suspicious when you see something
like a raw IP address in the browser.
Technically, there's nothing wrong with
it. But it's a little bit of a weird
branding or marketing decision for a
website. And I think a correlary of this
then logically is that if you are
running a website of your own or if
you're running a business with a website
of your own, you should really avoid
using many different URL formats or many
different domains or having any sort of
curiosities or weirdnesses in your
domain names because you're really just
teaching users implicitly that your URL
format might change from time to time.
And certainly you never want to use just
an IP address because you're going to
train people to expect that. And so
standardizing on one or very few domain
names or subdomains is generally best
for that. So what are some other attacks
that we should be mindful of when it
comes to our own software? Well, a class
of attacks or category of attacks are
generally known as code injection, which
is an opportunity for an adversary to
somehow inject code into your software
and often trick your software into
executing that code even if you yourself
didn't write it. Well, let's consider
one example of this. A common attack on
the web in particular too is what's
known as crosssight scripting or XSS for
short. Cross-sight scripting refers to
this potential opportunity for an
adversary to trick one website into
executing code that they again
themselves did not write. So what form
might this actually take? Well, suppose
that you yourself visit google.com and
suppose that Google isn't aware of this
particular attack. They certainly are
nowadays. But suppose that they weren't
yet aware that this attack exists. And
so when someone like you or I goes to
google.com and searches for something
like cats, suppose they do the
following. They show you a whole page of
search results. And I won't bother
showing the actual results, but as of
today, there were six billion uh 420
million cats on the internet that Google
knows about. And there they would show
up, of course, down here. Now, notice a
few characteristics about google.com as
it typically behaves. Well, one, you
still see a text box containing what it
is you searched for so that you can
change it or at least see what it is.
And notice too that in smaller text here
in this particular version of Google, it
tells you not how not only how many
results there are, but specifically how
many cats there are. So that is to say,
if Google is using your own input, not
only to remind you of what you searched
for in the search box, but also in the
body of the web page, that very simple
idea is vulnerable to an attack. Why?
Because who wrote the word cats? C A Ts.
Well, it wasn't Google, per se. It was
me. Now, fortunately, cats in and of
itself is not dangerous. But suppose I
knew a little something about HTML and
browsers and how the internet works. And
suppose that I now an adversary did
something like this. And knowing that
Google is probably inside of their web
page rendering HTML that looks like
this, a paragraph of text per the open
paragraph and close paragraph tag and an
English sentence like this about 6
billion420 million cats. If I know
they're putting my input cats into HTML
that looks like this, let me see if I
can try to trick Google into outputting
something that they might not have
anticipated. So instead of cats, let me
type something of a little weird that
looks like this. Now, what are we
looking at? We're looking at now an HTML
tag, the script tag, both opened and
closed here, and a little bit of code in
a language called JavaScript. Now,
thankfully, this in and of itself is not
actually a compelling attack. It's
literally just going to display attack
quote unquote on the screen. So, it's
just meant to be representative, I
claim, of how I could potentially trick
a website like Google into executing
code that I wrote, not that they wrote.
So, what do I mean by that? Notice that
I've got this open script tag here and
the closed script tag here, which means
everything in between there is script.
That is JavaScript, this particular
language. Well, it turns out this
particular language in the context of
browsers comes with a function, a
feature known as alert. And if you want
to alert the user with some message, you
literally write the word alert and then
an open parenthesis and a closed
parenthesis on the left and right. And
then inside of single quotes or double
quotes, you put whatever word or words
that you want to alert the user to. So,
this is often used for displaying
messages to the user. Not actual
attacks, but useful messages. And
there's more elegant ways to do this as
well, but this is the simplest
representation of an attack that I could
propose here. Now, I haven't yet hit
enter on this page because indeed we
still see that we're on the page
relating to cats as my search result.
But as soon as I hit enter after
searching for this string of JavaScript
code or really HTML inside of which is
JavaScript code, what might happen?
Well, this could potentially happen.
Now, again, this is not a bad thing in
this specific case. It's just throwing
up an alert to the user. And in this
sense, too, I'm really only attacking
myself because if I'm the adversary and
this is my browser and I've just tricked
Google into executing some JavaScript
code such that a pop-up appears saying
attack, well, I'm just like hacking
myself. So, this is inconsequential, but
again, it's representative of how we
could potentially trick a website into
executing code that they did not intend.
Now, why is this displaying? But notice
no more cats and no input here that I
typed myself. Last time when I searched
for cats, I saw the word cats here. But
now I'm seeing nothing at all. Now, why
is that? Well, underneath the hood,
previously I claimed that Google was
probably rendering HTML like this. A
paragraph of text, open tag, close tag,
and then the sentence about 6 billion,
420 million cats. So, HTML and they were
just plugging in whatever I, the human
typed in. Well, this time I conjecture
that if I typed in what looks like and
is HTML with a bit of scary JavaScript
code in between, what Google is probably
going to try to output in the body of
the web page they send to my browser is
this an open paragraph tag and a closed
paragraph tag. still the beginning of a
sentence assuming that there are this
many uh attacks in the world 6
billion420 million but notice this
because I the user literally typed in
the script tag and the closed script tag
and then that JavaScript code in between
the browser doesn't know that that came
from me and not Google. So they the
browser is just going to read this as
hey browser start a paragraph about 6
billion420 million. Hey browser, here
comes a script that is a program that
you should execute. What do I execute?
Alert quote unquote attack. Hey browser,
that's it for the script. Hey browser,
that's it for the paragraph. So if
Google is just blindly copying and
pasting what I, the human am typing in,
I might trick Google into rendering HTML
that Google did not intend. And the side
effect in this case is that I see this
alert, but really that's indicative of a
potential exploit in Google's website if
they were not uh detecting this on their
own. So this is the code that's
dangerous. And what then is the
fundamental problem? They are just
literally outputting what I, the
adversary, typed in to their page. So
how do we go about mitigating something
like this to avoid this kind of attack?
Well, let's first propose that what we
want the effect to be is something a
little more like this. Assuming again
that there are 6 billion420 million
attacks in the world. What I want to see
is literally that English sentence here.
I don't want any sort of popup. So this
I would propose is the correct behavior
assuming we see more search results down
below. I have searched for this. Google
is telling me or reminding me what I
searched for, but there's no pop-ups in
this case. So somehow or other based on
this screenshot alone, there must be a
way of ensuring on Google's end that
even if the human types in HTML with
perhaps some JavaScript code in the
middle that they don't actually treat it
as HTML and JavaScript code in the
middle, they just display it literally
character by character whatever I the
user typed in. So what is our concern
with this particular symptom? Well, it
turns out that an adversary can wage
what we would call a reflected attack
whereby we could leverage this symptom
in such a way that maybe we can
construct a URL that if clicked by a
user actually triggers this kind of
behavior, but moreover doesn't just
trigger this fairly innocuous behavior
like alerting the user with a message
like attack just to scare them. But what
if we wrote even more malicious
JavaScript code that maybe steals their
cookies or does something more than
that? Well, how do you wage what's
called here reflected attack? Well,
let's first consider what a basic link
in a web page or an email looks like.
It's again an anchor tag that starts and
ends. It has an href attribute that
represents the URL or file to which
we're going to link the user and then
some text that the human will actually
see in the web page. And now let's
notice when we correctly search for cats
as we did before that not only do we see
cats in the text box here, not only do
we see cats in the body of the web page,
but notice now the URL. It turns out
when you search for something on Google,
you end up at a URL that looks
essentially like this. It might actually
be a little longer, but a lot of those
parameters, so to speak, in the URL
aren't strictly necessary. So this is
the shortest possible URL that will work
on Google if you want to search for
cats. And notice what it is. https
www.google.com/arch
question mark q equals cats. So this is
to say that the way Google works is that
if you want to search for cats, you
simply visit a URL that looks like this.
If you want to search for dogs, you
visit a URL that looks almost like this,
but instead has Q equals dogs. which is
to say there's just a very standard
format on google.com and a lot of other
websites too for searching for things or
really sending input to a web server and
this web form or this text box that you
typically use to type in cats or dogs or
anything else is just generating a URL
that looks like this and then Google
knows what to do with it. So how can we
leverage now that reality a little more
maliciously? Well, let's go back to our
HTML and let's again assume that the
adversary is trying to construct some
HTML for their own email or for their
own website in order to attack some
unsuspecting users. Well, instead of the
dot dot dots, let's be more specific.
Let's actually in a good way, in an
honest way, say that we're going to let
the user click on a word cats, which is
in between my open tag and closed tag.
And if they click on that, they're going
to end up at the legitimate Google
website where it's
httpsw.google.com/arch
question mark q equals cat. So this is
correct. This is not yet an attack. But
what if I am a little malicious and
instead of using the legitimate URL
there for searching for cats, suppose I
construct something a little more
cleverly that says we're going to give
them cats, but actually we're going to
bring them to this URL. Now, this is a
bit of a mouthful, and in fact, it wraps
onto two lines this time, but notice the
URL starts the same. https
www.google.com/arch
question mark q equals and then some
weird text
3 C script, percent 3, alert, wrapping
onto the other line, and so forth. So I
I dare say you're seeing some familiar
phrases now, script and alert, but
there's also some weird syntax there as
well. Now that weird syntax is just a
representation of URL escaping. It turns
out that certain characters in URLs like
angled brackets and other syntax is not
good to include in URLs because it might
be mistaken by the browser for something
else. And so URLs typically escape
punctuation symbols and other characters
using this percent syntax. Now it looks
a little weird to the user, but what's
more worrisome is what this is going to
be used for on Google's end. If the Q
value equals this whole bunch of text
and it's just the browser that's
encoding those special characters in
this way, what Google's really going to
see on its end is the actual script tag
with the actual alert and the actual
clos script tag that you and I
constructed earlier. That is to say,
what Google's going to receive from that
URL is no longer cats, quote unquote,
but this quote unquote because the
server's on going to automatically
convert the percent signs and those
weird characters back to the original
automatically. That's how URL encoding
works. So, what the server is going to
receive is this. And again, if the
server is vulnerable to naively just
outputting literally whatever the human
typed in the ri the risk is that they're
going to now execute that code. And what
if the code isn't just an alert? Maybe
it's something like this, which still
isn't in of itself a bad thing because
it's just an alert. But this is actually
some JavaScript code now. Alert open
parenthesis document.cookie close
parenthesis. that would actually throw
up a dialogue window that shows the user
the value of the cookies they have there
on Google's website. Okay, not such a
big deal. It's not all that much all
that different from just saying quote
unquote attack. But what this means is
that in JavaScript, you have access to
all of the cookies for a website, at
least those that are made available to
JavaScript. And if an adversary doesn't
use the alert function, but maybe uses a
little more code to send the value of
document.cookie to their own website or
to somehow send other information from
the web page, the user's username or any
other personally identifying
information. Suffice it to say that by
re being able to write code in
JavaScript and by being able to trick a
server like Google in this story into
executing that code, you can effectively
by transitivity trick a user's browser
into executing that code for you. So the
adversary is sort of sending the code
into Google and it's being reflected
back to some user if they click that
same link in an email or a website. And
at this point, things like their own
cookies might be vulnerable. And again,
to be clear, this in of itself should
not hurt you. I'm just using alert as
demonstrative of what could be possible.
But you could do any number of other
things with document.cookie or other
values from a web page as soon as you
have this ability to write JavaScript
that's reflected back into someone
else's browser. Any questions then on
this particular attack? I just wanted to
ask a question about the JavaScript
blockage because many of the browsers
uses uses to block the JavaScript. How
can you use the websites and browser
which blocks the JavaScript without
getting tricked into the JavaScript?
>> It's a really good question. Um, and the
short answer is nowadays that that's not
really the best technique to just block
JavaScript. The reality is in this point
in time so many websites most websites
dare say use if not rely on JavaScript
to do any number of features or render
their own content. And so it's just I
think not realistic to just disable
JavaScript in order to protect yourself
from these kinds of attacks. In a bit
we'll discuss ways to mitigate this kind
of attack where you disable some
JavaScript but not all. But in general,
I don't think that's a realistic
solution, at least on most websites
nowadays. So, how else might these same
principles be misused? Well, it turns
out there's another class of attacks
known as a stored attacks, whereby the
adversar's input isn't just immediately
reflected back from the server to some
unsuspecting user, as it might be when
you're using the URL to contain the
code. But suppose that a website were
vulnerable to actually storing the
user's input, even if the user's input
includes HTML with some JavaScript
inside. Well, that would be a stored
attack. And it might work as follows. At
the risk of picking on Google, suppose
that when using Gmail, suppose that you
if you sent someone an email with that
exact same code whereby you're just
alerting quote unquote attack. Again,
that in of itself isn't going to hurt
anyone, but it's representative of what
you could do with code. Now, presumably
when you send an email in Gmail or
Outlook or any other service, that email
is going to be stored on a server until
it's read and until it's deleted perhaps
by the user. And if it's never deleted,
it's going to stay stored on the server.
So, this type of attack assumes that the
server might actually be saving in a
database or a file somewhere the user's
input. Now suppose that here too Google
didn't know about these kinds of
cross-sight scripting attacks and they
just allow you and me to input HTML and
JavaScript into an email and they just
blindly save it into their database and
then when the recipient opens this email
they just show the recipient the
contents of that email. Well, what could
go wrong? Well, if the recipient opens
that particular email and Google is
literally rendering the script tag with
the JavaScript inside, the recipient of
that email, when they open their inbox
may very well suffer some kind of an
attack. Again, it just says attack on
the screen, but it represents being
tricked into running code that someone
else wrote. And in this case, someone
else sent you. Ideally, what we would
want to have happen instead is not have
Google show us the attack message here,
but rather I would like my inbox to show
me the code I was sent, but not execute
it. That is, just like I wanted to know
that there are 6 billion420 million cats
among the search results, so would I
want Gmail to just show me what it is
the adversary typed in without actually
interpreting it or executing it as HTML
with some JavaScript inside.
So that could be a stored attack and
would be a stored attack if thankfully
Google weren't actually protecting us
against this which they are. So how do
you go about preventing an attack like
this in software? Well the general
answer is character escapes. That is
taking any characters in users input
that might potentially be misinterpreted
at wor at best or at worst might be
dangerous to the users. Now, what
characters might be worrisome? Well, in
something like HTML, anything with an
angled bracket, a less than sign, would
probably potentially be mistaken for the
beginning of an HTML tag. So, I dare say
that a a less than sign is a dangerous
character. Similarly, might a greater
than sign represent the end of a tag?
So, that too might be something to give
us concern. And there's probably a few
other characters as well. So, what
should servers be doing? What should
software be doing to avoid this kind of
cross-sight scripting attacks whether
reflected or stored? Well, ideally
something like this would not just be
blindly outputed by Google or by Gmail,
but rather it would be escaped in this
very weird looking way. But let me
highlight just a subset of these
characters. Highlighted in yellow now
are only the character escapes to which
I'm referring. It turns out that this
language HTML has standardized some
special sequences of characters that
represent the less than sign that
represent the greater than sign. They're
a little more verbose to type. You have
to type out like four characters in this
particular case. But browsers are
designed to know that when they see
amperand LT semicolon, they should not
show on the screen amperand LT
semicolon. They should show a less than
sign. And similarly, when browsers see
amperand gt semicolon, they should
display not literally that, but a
greater than sign. So this is to say if
Google were smart, they would take any
user input you and I give them, but they
would make sure to escape any
potentially dangerous characters with
these kinds of escape sequences, so to
speak. and Google's got to look it up in
a book or on a website or in the
specification to know what escape uh
they should use. But these are very well
documented and standardized. And indeed,
we have one here, one one here for the
open script tag, and then another here
and here for the closed script tag. But
notice, we don't have to escape all of
the punctuation like the the slash or
the English letters in the tag name or
the like. We're only escaping a certain
list of these characters. Well, what is
that list? Here are the five that
minimally we should generally be
escaping depending on the context. The
less than sign should be amperand lt
semicolon. The greater than sign, the
amperand sign for the very reason that
we're now potentially creating a new
problem if we're using amperand all over
the place. What if the user's input has
an amperand? We don't want to confuse
the amperand and the user's input for a
a character escape. So there actually
needs to be a more verbose way amperand
p semicolon to represent literally an
amperand. Then there's one for a double
quote amperand qo t semicolon and a
single quote or apostrophe amperand apos
semicolon. And there's more as well, but
generally these are the five that could
otherwise get you in trouble. So, all of
the examples we've seen thus far where
Google is somehow reflecting back or
storing potential attack code will not
happen if Google is just smart, whereby
they're escaping that input from a user
before sending it back out as output to
google.com search results or to Gmail
inboxes.
So, how else might we actually prevent
attacks like these? Well, we can also
put in place other measures as well. And
recall from past classes, we discussed
this notion of HTTP headers. And an HTTP
header is a line of text that's stored
in those virtual envelopes that gets
sent from browsers to servers and from
servers to browsers. Inside of the
envelope typically is the actual request
for a web page or the actual contents of
the response for a web page. But also in
those envelopes are additional
information, namely these HTTP headers,
which are key value pairs that provide
additional instructions, if you will, to
the browser or server. So for instance,
suppose that we want to ensure that this
kind of reflected or stored attack isn't
possible whereby we're accidentally
embedding script tags in our own
websit's HTML. Well, suppose that the
website in question now isn't google.com
specifically, but more generally
example.com. And suppose that
example.com's web server is configured
to output always in those virtual
envelopes in HTTP header that is
content- security-p policy colon. So
that string of text is the key and the
value of that key is script- source then
the URL that we want to allow scripts
from only. So what does this mean?
Albeit fairly cryptic, if you configure
a web server with this HTTP header, this
will ensure that you can only load
JavaScript code from actual files,
typically ending in.js,
that are sent separately from the server
to the browser. This line of an HTTP
header prevents inline scripts, so to
speak, whereby it allows the browser to
execute any old script tag in the web
page. This prevents that default
behavior. So as such, even if Google,
even if example.com messes up and
forgets to use character escapes when
rendering user input that came from a
URL or came from an email or any other
source, this header should at least tell
the browser, at least newer browsers,
uh-uh, even if you accidentally see a
script tag with some JavaScript inside
of it in my web page, don't execute it.
only allow me to execute JavaScript code
that came from a separate file. The only
type of JavaScript that will now be
allowed is if I have a tag that looks
like this in my HTML, which is an
alternative version of the script tag,
but instead of embedding any code inside
of the open tag and the close tag
itself, it refers to the source of
abbreviated src some file typically
again ending in.js. So if this dot dot
dot were the URL of a file that contains
JavaScript code, that would be allowed
because the presumption there is that if
someone went through the trouble of
creating that file on our own server,
example.com, presumably that code is
safe. But what this line in our header
does is it ensures that we can only
execute JavaScript code if it comes from
example.com in a separate file using an
HTML tag like this. it will prohibit
that HTML HTTP header any script tags
that are inlined in the body of our
actual web pages. What else can we do?
Well, it turns out and we haven't talked
about it in this class, there's other
languages that you can use in the
context of web pages. Not only HTML, not
only JavaScript, but also a language
called CSS or cascading stylesheets,
which is generally used to style your
page. if familiar or if you take a
course on web development know that
there's similarly a mechanism whereby
you can specify that only CSS from a
specific server like example.com should
be allowed either not inline style tags
with which you might be familiar as
well. So here instead of script source
we see style source which is just
another way using this HTTP header
mechanism to just ensure that the
browser at least if it's new enough will
not blindly execute script tags in the
first case or style tags in the second
case when these kinds of headers are
present. It's an additional layer of
dispense against these kinds of
reflected or stored attacks. Indeed,
that particular HTTP header would only
allow us to conclude CSS in our web page
if it uses a tag like this, namely a
link tag with an href value, the dot dot
dot of which in this case would be the
URL of a CSS file on the particular
server example.com. The relationship of
which is to the page that of this thing
called a stylesheet.
questions then on this use of HTTP
headers to prevent these kinds of stored
or reflected attacks or anything else
thus far.
>> What do the back slash T and back slash
ASCAP sequence do?
>> Back slashp and O in the HTML. Um so
recall that a lot of our tags have open
tags and closed tags and the slash, it's
actually a forward slash, not a
backslash. The forward slash here just
finishes the thought for the browser. So
this starts the tag, this ends the tag
and you use the same word script in this
case, script in this case or a or p as
you describe that is what uh closes or
ends the tag in question so that you
know where the tag ends or where the
paragraph ends. Other questions
>> pertaining the react framework as far as
I understand on the SX format you use
interchangeably both JavaScript and HTML
how that isn't a security risk uh for
these kind of attacks.
>> Really good question um beyond the scope
of this this class for those who don't
have a programming background. However,
yes, um, React and other frameworks use
a technique called JSX, which combines
JavaScript with HTML with CSS that are
rendered by the browser. In that case
though, Matteo, the browser is running
JavaScript code that comes from the
React library that is reading as input
that JSX code and converting it to the
resulting uh, code that should be
executed within the browser. So long as
all of that code comes from.js JS files
or CSS files or the like all as well.
But if you just inline it and you're
outputting headers like this, it won't
execute at all. So the same rules apply.
You would have to use an external file.
So when it comes to code injection,
there are other types of attacks,
particularly in the context of what's
called SQL or structured query language,
which is a language that's typically
used with databases. So again, on a
server. So let's consider how you might
also trick software into executing SQL
code that is code written in this
particular language when it comes to
databases specifically. Well, here for
instance is some representative code in
this language called SQL whereby you
have a line like select star from users
where username equals quote unquote and
then username in curly braces. Now
consider this to be pseudo code of sorts
because I'm mixing some SQL syntax with
some uh Python syntax in this case
because it turns out that when you're
using this language SQL or SQL you
typically use it in combination with
some other language be it Python or PHP
or Java or something else and you use
that other language typically to
construct queries dynamically based on
values that humans have typed in. So for
instance, if you're logging into a
website and you type in your username
and hit enter, very often if that
website is implemented in Python or PHP
or Java, it might use one of those
languages to construct a SQL query that
is then actually sent to the database to
look up that specific user who's trying
to log in. So what I have here then is
mostly SQL syntax except for in these
curly braces some Python specific
syntax. And what this curly brace with
username inside of it represents is uh
hey server plug in whatever the human
typed in as their username into that
part of the string. So the curly braces
and the word username should be replaced
with literally something like mailin if
that is the user who's trying to log in.
And that will then resulting the
resulting code will be sent to the
database to select everything we know
from the user's table so to speak in
that database about that particular
username. So what could potentially go
wrong here? Well, it all has to do with
again trusting input from the user and
that should now be emerging as a theme.
You should generally always mistrust
input that comes from users. you should
do something with it, but you should
sanitize it or scrub it in such a way
that any potentially dangerous
characters are somehow escaped. And
that's exactly what the solution was to
those cross-sight scripting attacks
whereby so long as we escaped the user's
input and changed the less than sign and
the greater than sign and maybe some
other symbols as well to the equivalent
character escapes, all was well. So here
too is an example now in the context of
databases where a bit of paranoia will
go a long way to keeping your software
secure. Why? Well suppose that my
username is indeed mailin but suppose
that's not what I type into the website
when trying to log in for instance. So
instead of typing just my username
suppose I am suspicious as the adversary
that this website is probably using a
database and that database is probably
using this language SQL. So, what could
I do to kind of mess with the the owners
of this website and try to trick their
database into executing my code and not
just their own? How do I inject code of
my own? Well, instead of mailing, let me
a little cryptically type this in to the
website where I'm prompted for my
username. Now, this does look cryptic
and odds are an adversary is not going
to know exactly what to type the very
first time they try to hack into a
server. rather it's through trial and
error very often that an adversary might
eventually realize ah this is what I
could probably type into that website to
inject some code of my own. So to be
clear what have I typed? I've still
typed my username m a ln but then I've
typed a single quote and then a
semicolon and then delete from users and
then another semicolon and then a dash
dash. Now, if you don't know SQL and you
are not expected to know SQL for this
course, this looks weird probably, but
each of these symbols, each of these
punctuation symbols in particular means
something specific and serves a
particular purpose. Now, what might that
be? Well, let me go back to the original
query. And now, let me assume that in
yellow here, the curly braces with
username is where my username is
supposed to go. And my username is
supposed to be Men. But what if I type
in that long sequence of cryptic text?
Here's what's going to happen on the
server. Because it's using a language
like Python or PHP or Java, this yellow
value is going to be interpolated. That
is replaced with whatever the human
typed in. So let's do that. Let me paste
in what I, the adversary, typed in. And
notice I've kept yellow the user's
input. So everything in white is still
the part of the SQL query that the
designers of the database came up with
in advance. But everything in yellow is
what came from like a form on the web,
an adversary in my case. And this looks
a little cryptic still, but even if
you've never seen SQL before, you might
have an intuition for what could go
wrong because I, the adversary, typed
not only Malen, but a single quote here.
Notice that, oh my goodness, that
perfectly lines up with the single quote
that the database designer used in their
query. And so even though this white
quote is meant to be closed by this
white quote way over here, notice that
grammatically in this language, not to
mention in English and other human
languages, this single quote here or
apostrophe because it comes first will
be presumed to close this single quote
or this apostrophe here. The semicolon,
it turns out in this language SQL ends a
thought. It's like a period in English.
And so anything after a semicolon is
like a new command altogether. So notice
that delete from users semicolon is like
a second command that came entirely from
me the adversary. And then dash dash it
turns out and this is very clever dash
in a lot of versions of SQL represents a
comment. And a comment in a programming
language means ignore everything after
this. Because a problem right now is
that that single quote, that apostrophe
was meant to surround the user's
username. But because I, the adversary,
already gave you a single quote to use
accidentally as closing this thought,
well, we don't need this single quote at
the very end anymore. So this is why the
adversary or me in the story is doing
dash dash. That's just going to tell the
server, okay, ignore everything after
that, including the single quote that we
do not need grammatically. So, let me
reformat this a bit. I'm going to go
ahead and add some new lines, some white
space just to make it a little more
readable. What you see on the screen
here right now is equivalent to this.
Notice that I've moved the delete
command to its own line just for
readability sake. I've gotten rid of the
final apostrophe, the single quote,
because it was after a comment, which
means by design it's meant to be
ignored. So what I have done as the
adversary because I presumed or inferred
or figured out that this website is
using single quotes and they're just
blindly interpolating that is replacing
those curly braces and username with
literally anything I type in. I can
trick the server into finishing this
first command by saying select star from
users where username equals quote
unquote mailin semicolon. And worse, I
can trick this particular database into
executing a second SQL command, which
even if again you've never seen SQL,
deleting is probably a bad thing. It's
probably a destructive thing that you
don't want some random adversary on the
internet being able to do on your
server. So what's the goal of these
lines here? Well, the original intent of
the first query presumably I claim was
just to search for the user in the
database so that they could log in. So
when I type in mailin and hit enter, I
am somehow able to log in probably after
typing also a password, maybe a
two-factor code or the like. But select
star from users where username equals
mail. Fine. That's probably going to
retrieve the information that it was
supposed to retrieve. The dangerous part
here is that I trick this server into
executing a second command and this one
looks destructive. Delete from user
semicolon means delete all of the users
from the system. So it doesn't help the
adversary in this case get into the
system or do anything with the mailin
account other than delete it and
literally every other account in the
system. So this is bad. This is
representative of a SQL injection
whereby I the adversary wrote code that
you the designer of this database
accidentally naively treated as part of
your own commands.
So, how else could things go wrong?
Well, not only could you do something
destructive like deleting data from the
database, but suppose that the user is
prompted at the same time for a username
and a password now in the story. And
suppose therefore that the query in the
software is this. Select star from users
where username equals quote unquote
username in curly braces. But one more
phrase and password equals quote unquote
password based on whatever the human
typed in as their password. So again to
be clear in this story the user is
prompted for a username and a password.
And the SQL command that's going to use
those two values looks like this. But
here too, we're setting the stage for an
injection attack. Why? Because based on
these placeholders with the curly braces
around username and password, it looks
like we're just going to blindly plug in
to this command exactly what it is the
human had typed for their username and
password respectively. So what could a
more sophisticated adversary now do?
Well, maybe instead of typing in mailin
and then whatever mailin's actual
password is, suppose that they just want
to get into someone's account. Maybe
mailin's maybe someone else's
altogether. What if the adversary
doesn't just type mailin, not to mention
Men's password, but what if they type in
this specifically for Mailyn's password?
Now, this is weird and I'll tell you
now, this is not in fact my password.
But what has the adversary typed in? a
single quote, the word or, then another
single quote with a one and a single
quote equals a single quote and a one.
So, this looks very, very weird, but
let's see what happens. And again, most
adversaries wouldn't figure this out the
first time they try. Odds are they'd be
trying a whole bunch of techniques and
juristics to figure out what might
actually work for them. So, we're fast
forwarding to the end of the story where
the adversary has figured out that this
weird sequence of characters can hack
into this server by tricking it into
executing code that wasn't intended. So,
here again in yellow is exactly what the
adversary has typed in. Men, which may
very well be a legitimate username, but
then for the password in yellow, single
quote or single quote one single quote
equals single quote one. And based on
our previous example, you can perhaps
see what's starting to go on here. We've
finished the mail and thought naturally,
like we didn't type anything malicious
for the username this time, but we did
type something seemingly malicious for
the password. And the first single quote
in yellow quickly finishes the password.
Quote unquote, nothing in between. But
then we're saying or quote unquote one
equals quote one. Why? Well, the
adversary in this case kind of figured
out or knew or guessed that the SQL
command ends with a single quote itself.
So the whole point here is even though
this two probably looks very cryptic is
that grammatically what the adversary
has typed in not only perfectly aligns
with the username field because it's
just mailing nothing special there but
very cleverly the adversary has finished
the thought of this single quote and
also finished the thought of this single
quote. So, we've made everything
balanced just like you would not only in
SQL, but in a language like English. So,
let me go ahead and clean this up a
little bit too to make clear why this is
dangerous. This command now once formed
by the server based on that adversar's
input is really the same as this. And
I'm just going to add again a new line
and some white space just to help us
wrap our minds around what's going on.
So, I've just moved the ore line to the
bottom. And just like in math class
years ago, let me go ahead and put
parentheses around things here. That
makes clear what the precedence is of
things like and and or. It turns out
that and like multiplication binds at a
higher precedence. It's more important.
You're supposed to do it first. So, I'm
going to add parentheses now to this
first expression. They're not strictly
necessary. They're implied. I'm just
making them explicit now to show you
just like in math class, the order of
operations. Now, what does this mean?
This means that the database is going to
say select star from user. So select
everything from the users table where
the username is mailin and the password
is quote unquote. Now that is probably
not my password. My password is
definitely not nothing. It's not empty.
But that doesn't matter. Now why?
Because even if this first clause where
username equals mailin and password
equals quote unquote, even if that
doesn't find anyone in the database with
a username of mailin and a password of
quote unquote, it doesn't matter because
we've tricked the database command into
including an or which is so stupid that
it's always true or one equals 1. Well,
one always equals one, which means that
now logically this query is going to
return everything we know about users
from the database. And why is this
problematic? Well, when you're logging
users into a datab logging users into a
website or application, you're typically
searching for them in the database. And
typically, if you get back one or more
users, you're going to assume that the
very first user is the one that you
want. And maybe in this case it's
mailin, but it's also very common in
servers for the very first user that was
created to be you, the person that
designed the site. And you probably have
administrative privileges, that is
access over everything in the system.
And so if a query like this is returning
all of the users including you as the
very first one, if there's additional
code in the system that we won't put on
the screen here or bother hypothesizing
about it means that you could be now
letting the adversary log in maybe as
mailin but worse maybe as you all
because you trusted user input. But you
should never trust that your users if
called mailin are going to type in just
mail. You should always assume that
there's someone out there very
annoyingly, very maliciously that's
going to try using some single quotes,
some semicolons, or in HTML we saw a
less than sign, a greater than sign. You
should always expect that someone on the
internet will have enough time and
interest in hacking your website or
application that this might indeed
happen to you and your software. So
what's the solution then? How do you
avoid a query that's equivalent
ultimately to this? Because if there's
no mail in with no password, it's still
the same as asking for where one equals
one, which is anything. And to be clear,
I didn't have to use one. I could have
used two or three or four. I could have
used cat or dog or anything else. So
long as the thing on the left equals the
thing on the right and I type that into
the the application. The same thing
would certainly equal itself is the
point here. And one is just the simplest
thing we could think of. So what is the
solution here to SQL injection attack
specifically? Well, it's very similar in
spirit to the notion of character
escapes, but in the world of SQL, it
there tend to be standard ways of
escaping dangerous characters. You don't
have to do it yourself. And much like
security in general with with encryption
specifically, you probably should not be
writing code yourself to solve problems
like these that hundreds, thousands,
millions of people before you have
already had to deal with and have
probably solved correctly. Do not
reinvent wheels when you don't need to
in the context of security. So this is
to say in the world of databases most
databases support what are called
prepared statements which is a fancy way
of saying that you provide the code for
your SQL query. You provide placeholders
for wherever you want user input but let
the database itself replace or
interpolate those placeholders with the
user's actual input and let the database
handle escaping anything dangerous. And
we've seen that things are dangerous
like apostrophes thus far. So for
instance in uh instead of writing a
single apostrophe and this is weird
admittedly in the world of SQL the way
you typically escape an apostrophe is
not like HTML you don't do amperand apos
semicolon. You don't like in some
languages put a backslash in front of
it. Typically the way weirdly you escape
a single quote or an apostrophe in SQL
is very often by putting two of them in
a row. So why we'll defer that to
another day. But this is just the
convention. Now this means that you
could write code that changes any single
quote to two single quotes. But again
don't bother doing that. Use
functionality that comes with the
database or whatever library you're
using. So for instance, if we go back to
that very first query that was
vulnerable to being uh injected with
something like delete from users, what
if we now do this? Let's change our
Pythonbased placeholder using curly
braces in yellow here. And let's change
that and get rid of the quotes and just
put a question mark. This is one of the
common conventions in prepared
statements where you put a question mark
not because you don't know what to put
there but because you want the database
to replace that question mark with a
user's own input. Then what happens?
Well, if the user types in that
dangerous command with the delete inside
of it, notice what happens. Here's the
single quote. Here's the close single
quote. And the database has given that
to you automatically. The prepared
statement adds those single quotes for
you. Notice that even though I, the
adversary, only typed in mailin single
quote semicolon, the prepared statement
has gone ahead and escaped a single
quote or apostrophe with two of them
instead. And nothing else here
thereafter is actually too worrisome.
That alone is sufficient to solve the
problem. Now, this looks a little weird,
right? because it kind of looks like
logically well you still have this quote
and this quote which line up and you
still have this quote and this quote
which line up so it looks like we
haven't really fundamentally solved the
problem but we have it turns out in SQL
databases anytime they see two single
quotes back to back they don't try to
pair them with something to the left or
something to the right they just treat
it as one special escape sequence so to
speak so that would then fix this query
and if we go back to the second query
which had two placeholders, username and
password using this Python syntax. Let
me go ahead and change that to prepared
statement syntax using in this case
question marks without quotes and trust
that the database itself will add any
necessary quotes and escape any
potentially dangerous characters. Now,
what did the adversary type in in that
second scenario? Well, it was just
innocuously mailing and so that comes
back from the prepared statement as
being prepared with quote unquote on the
outside. No problem there. But this
other input from the user from the
adversar's password which was very
cryptic with lots of single quotes.
Notice that every single quote in the
adversar's so-called password has been
escaped. So that the single quote here
becomes two. The single quote here
becomes two. The single quote here
becomes two. The single quote here
becomes two. And the prepared statement
automatically adds a final single quote
at the very end. But I've kept
highlighted in yellow everything that
represents the user's input. now that
it's been properly escaped. Because
again, even though you might try
mentally to pair this quote with this
one, this one with this one, this one
with this one, and so forth, that's not
what the database does. Whenever it sees
in this case two apostrophes back to
back, they are treated as special escape
sequences. And so the only quotes that
ultimately are treated as lining up are
the two around the username and the two
around the entire password here. So the
characters are still in there, but
they've been escaped, sanitized, or
scrubbed, so to speak, in such the way
that now the database is smart enough
not to mistake those for quotes that
should be matched with ones that we
might have otherwise written previously.
Now, there is another class of attacks
that similarly involve injection into
your software, particularly command
injection. Those of you familiar with a
command line interface in the context of
a terminal window or the like might be
familiar with how on a system you write
you type commands as opposed to always
using your mouse to point and click on
menus and buttons. The problem with
command injection is that it's all too
easy in a lot of today's programming
languages to write code that invokes
commands on systems whether it's to copy
files, delete files, move files, execute
other commands altogether. And that's
because a lot of programming languages
come with functions. That is a feature
called system, which is literally a
feature of some programming languages
that allow you in your program to
execute a command on the underlying
system, a command on the underlying
operating system. Now, that might that
might be useful for you because in
addition to writing your own code in
some higher level language, you can
occasionally like run a command on the
system itself. But the problem is that
if you the programmer somehow take user
input and you just blindly pass that
user's input to the command line so to
speak to the terminal window to the
underlying operating system. That is yet
another context in which potentially
dangerous characters like semicolons or
the like could accidentally finish your
thought but then start a completely new
one from the adversary. So that they too
on your system cannot can not only
delete things like uh data from your
database but even files from your file
system. They could perhaps send email or
spam or do anything in a command line
environment that you yourself could do
on the same in other programming
languages. The same idea exists in the
context of another function called eval
which evaluates whatever you pass to it.
So there too if you're in the habit of
using system or eval taking user input
and passing that user input as part of
the input to system or eval without
having sanitized it or scrubbed it or
more generally escaped potentially
dangerous characters you're putting your
entire system at risk and any and other
any and all software that's installed on
or running on the same. So what's the
solution here? In any of those
programming languages to which I'm
alluding that have functions like system
or eval, they almost always come with
another function or built into these
functions a way of escaping the user's
input. So I would always take care to
read the documentation if you yourself
are or want to become a programmer that
whenever you take user input you always
figure out and think to yourself wait a
minute how can I escape this properly so
that I can't be tricked into executing
some command some SQL or some HTML and
JavaScript within my own software. All
right that's been a lot. Let's go ahead
here and take a five minute break and
when we resume we'll look at a whole
other category of potential attacks on
software.
All right, we're back. Let's go ahead
and return to this world of HTML on the
web. If only because so much of today's
software is actually web- based. And
indeed, even on your Macs or PCs or
phones, what looks like a native
application, so to speak, might actually
still be implemented in HTML with that
other language, JavaScript and CSS.
Well, it turns out in the context of a
browser, there's very often a feature
called developer tools. And indeed, if
you've done any web development of your
own, you might have played with this
feature. And these developer tools,
which might be called something slightly
different across different browsers,
allow you to poke around the HTML, the
CSS, and the JavaScript that compose
some web page either that you yourself
have made or that someone else has made
and you have downloaded or accessed via
your own browser. Let's consider now
though what you can do if you have
access to these developer tools. So for
instance here is some HTML using a tag
called input which would create a
checkbox on a website. We haven't seen
this one yet but it's similar in spirit
to the paragraph tag and the anchor tag
in which case it is interpreted as the
browser as meaning hey browser here
comes a checkbox. The only thing
different that's worth noting here is
that some HTML tags don't actually need
a closed [snorts] tag. Because whereas a
paragraph starts somewhere and then ends
somewhere else after some number of
words, a checkbox is either there or it
isn't there. So there's really no
conceptual notion of it starting and
stopping. So some HTML tags don't even
need end tags or close tags. This then
is one of them. This then is an input
tag that gives us a type of input,
namely a checkbox. And another curiosity
about this is that some HTML attributes
don't need values. We saw the href
attribute for the anchor tag earlier and
that of course had a value in quotes was
the URL that you want to link to. Here
we see that same paradigm type equals
quote unquote checkbox to give us
specifically a checkbox type of input.
But you'll also notice here another
attribute specifically for this input
tag that's literally called disabled.
And strictly speaking, you don't need to
give it a value because it's either
there or it isn't. And if it is there,
that just means that this checks box is
exactly that, disabled, which means you
can see it, but it's not checked and you
can't actually check it. It's disabled
and lightly grayed out typically on a
browser. So why might this be? Well,
maybe there's some feature in the
browser that you don't want to give some
users access to. Maybe based on who has
logged in, they should or should not
have access to some feature. The problem
though with HTML and CSS and JavaScript
or really anything that is webbased or
using those languages is that you're
sending this HTML to the user's own
device to their browser on their phone
or laptop or desktop which means they
can not only see this HTML code but
theoretically they can edit it. They
can't edit it on the server because
that's your own copy assuming they can't
hack into the server, but they can edit
their own copy thereof. Now, usually
that's not such a big deal because
what's the worst that can happen? They
can hack themselves by changing HTML on
their own computer or phone. But it is
problematic if you are using HTML or
even JavaScript to try to prevent
certain user interactions with your
server. So, for instance, if you simply
don't want a user to be able to check
this box so that when they submit a
form, they're not agreeing to something
or they're adding something uh to their
shopping cart by using this check box.
Well, you might rely therefore on this
HTML attribute disabled. Just prevent
them on the client in the browser from
checking this box. But it turns out with
developer tools, which are accessible
usually via a menu at the top of the
screen or by right-clicking or
control-clicking on a web page and then
selecting an option, a user with access
to HTML can change any and all of that
HTML on their own computer, which means
they could just remove this disabled
attribute in their own copy of your HTML
on their computer and effectively enable
that checkbox by getting rid of it. Now,
what does this mean? Well, there's no
problem yet. But if they do now check
that checkbox, and you didn't want them
to be able to, and they submit the
checkbox to the server as by clicking a
submit button in a web form, you on the
server, if you're not uh paranoid
enough, might just trust that if I see a
checked box being submitted via a form,
they must have been allowed to do it, so
I will trust them. But no, here too is
an example of where you should never
trust users input because if you're
trying to disable them from doing
something on the client, they don't have
to respect that. They can override the
HTML in their own browser, remove any
such defenses, and then send the
checkbox to you anyway. The takeaway
here then is that you really should
never rely on client side validation
alone. And this disabled attribute is
just one minor incarnation of that where
you're relying on the client to ensure
that the button is that the checkbox is
disabled and its value can't be sent to
the server. But clientside validation is
really on the honor system only because
if someone knows how to use these
developer tools and removes the disabled
attribute or if they know how to use
developer tools and maybe disable
JavaScript altogether for your website
on their computer any form of clientside
validation in HTML or JavaScript that
you wrote on the server but that your
server sent to their browser and that's
therefore executed by their browser is
vulnerable to simply being turned off.
So the catch is that even though client
side validation tends to be nice in
terms of user experience, the button is
obviously disabled so I should not be
able to click on it or my email address
is improperly formatted so I should not
be allowed to submit the form. Any forms
of clientside validation tend to give
the user immediate and often very useful
visual feedback. But if it's not
accompanied this client side validation
by server side validation, your server
software is still vulnerable to attack
in some way. So what else might what
other form might this take? Well, here's
another example of an HTML input. This
type this time it's of type text, which
means it's a text box on the field.
Suppose that you really want them to
provide that value. Maybe this text box
represents the user's name or their
email address or their password or
something like that. And so if you know
a little bit of HTML, you know that
there's not only a disabled attribute
available to you, but also a required
attribute and it doesn't have an equal
sign or a quote mark. You don't need
that. It suffices just to say this input
is required. But the catch here is too.
If a user doesn't want to give you a
name, doesn't want to give you an email
address, doesn't want to give you a
password or some other value, well, they
can use these so-called developer tools,
click a button on their browser, remove
the required attribute, and voila, now
they do not need to submit that value.
Now, that in of itself is not a problem
because again, they're only hacking
themsel. But if they're then allowed to
submit this form to your server and your
server just trusts or assumes that every
user will send you a username, an email
address, a password or the like, that's
where things can break if you're
trusting client side validation alone to
ensure that the user's input is as
expected. So if they're allowed to get
rid of something as simple as this
required attribute effectively making
the input like this, you might be
missing some value. And so you must
therefore use server side validation
again. And we won't get into the
particulars of how you do this because
it will completely depend on the type of
server software you're using, the
programming language that you're using.
And so it's really the principle today
that's important that client side
validation whereby the browser or the
user's own copy of your software tries
to preempt mistakes and require or
disable certain inputs. That's fine.
that tends to give good immediate useful
user feedback, but it must still be
always accompanied by server side
validation so that you have the final
say over what the user input looks like
and if and how it's actually stored into
your system. Again, the particulars of
how you do one or the other is the topic
for an actual programming class or a
class on web development specifically.
But for now, it's this principle. Just
because you have client side validation
doesn't mean you shouldn't also have
server side validation. And in fact, if
you've got to choose one or the other,
always choose server side validation.
Client side validation is really just
icing on the cake. It adds to the
experience, but it's not the
prerequisite one. questions then on
these so-called developer tools or these
kinds of threats when it comes to
validating the user's input.
>> Um yeah, so my question is more related
to SQL and command injections for a
second. Isn't it really easy to just not
uh run the user's commands with admin or
root privileges to delete certain
records from a database or something?
>> Yes. Another defense would be to make
sure that whatever username you're using
to execute these SQL commands does not
have the ability to delete uh anything
at all. However, some threats only need
select access. So the second example I
showed you whereby we trick the database
into just selecting star from users
where one equals one. That was an
example of one where permissionwise it
probably would work and it might allow
the adversary still to log in. But your
suggestion is a good one as an
additional defense, not an alternative.
Let's consider another class of attack
to which your code might be vulnerable
if it's on a server using the same
language, HTML, namely cross-sight
request forgeries or CSRF. So, this
one's more of a mouthful, but it too
relates to a mistake you might otherwise
make when writing software on a server
if you're not already familiar with this
kind of threat. So first, HTTP recall is
this protocol, this convention by which
web browsers and servers communicate.
Well, it turns out there's different
ways that browsers can get information
to a server. And one of those ways is
literally called get by convention. In
other words, inside of that virtual
envelope is typically literally this
word get followed by the file name that
the browser wants to get from a server.
But more importantly for our purposes is
that whenever you're using this get
method to send information to a server,
all of the information that you want to
get is embedded in the URL itself. So
what does that mean? Well, consider for
instance this sample link in HTML.
Here's my anchor tag beginning. Here's
my anchor tag ending. Notice here is the
text buy now. Well, let's suppose that
you're in the US here and on Amazon.com
in the US there's actually this feature
where you can buy now. That is to say,
when you visit the page of a product on
Amazon's website in the US, if not
beyond, you can skip the steps of having
to add an item to your shopping cart and
check out and choose your payment method
and then some number of clicks later
actually buy the product. Rather, if you
configure your account in advance, you
can go to any products page, literally
click a link or a button that says buy
now, and that's it. In a single click,
for better or for worse, that product
will be shipped to your home. So, how
might Amazon be implementing this? Well,
they might indeed be using a link like
this, the href value of which is a URL
like https
www.amazon.com/dp07xlq2fsk.
In other words, that seems to be enough
information in the URL alone via which
to buy the product whose unique
identifier is apparently that string of
text at the end. Now that's all fine and
good and that's actually seems very user
friendly because with a single click on
buy now I can indeed buy that product.
But the danger here is that if this link
is not just on Amazon.com but is in some
adversaries website or maybe in an email
that is sent to you. If it's that easy
to buy something now, you could trick
someone potentially into buying things
that they didn't actually intend in this
case or doing anything else on a web
server into which they're already logged
in if get is the method being used to
get something from that server. Well,
why is this exactly that this URL is
problematic? Well, consider for instance
the following HTML instead. Suppose that
you visit an adversary site who just
likes to create havoc in the world and
that adversary site doesn't even have an
anchor tag or a link that they want you
to trick. So it's not even as deliberate
as a fishing attack that they want you
to click some link. Suppose they're
using something like an image tag which
it turns out in HTML, img for short, is
how you embed an image on a web page.
And how do you specify what image? You
specify the source thereof, src for
short, the value of which can be the URL
of or the name of the image you want to
display. But strictly speaking, that URL
doesn't have to actually lead to an
image. It could actually lead to an
Amazon product page. But the way images
work on web pages, recall, is that
typically when you visit a web page, the
images automatically load. You don't
have to click or do anything typically
for the images to appear on a web page.
may be in emails and that's an
anti-ishing mechanism, but in web pages,
you typically don't have to click on
anything to see the images. That is to
say, the value of these source
attributes are just automatically
downloaded and displayed to the user.
Now, this in fairness is not an image,
but the browser doesn't necessarily know
that from the get-go. And so if this
HTML is in some adversar's website that
you've somehow been tricked into
visiting and you don't even click a
link, you just visit that web page, that
means this image tag is going to try to
download this source. And even though
it's not going to get an image, it is
going to buy that product for you. Why?
Because if you're logged into your
Amazon account, even though this is in
another tab, it's as though your browser
requested that URL via that get method
because all of the relevant information
for buying that product is in the URL
alone. So it turns out that using get is
actually not a good thing when it comes
to changing state on the server. To get
technical, the get method is meant to be
safe. safe whereby it does not change
any state or values on the server. So it
would actually be incorrect or
definitely bad practice by Amazon if
they were implementing their buy now
button simply with a simple URL and a
simple get request. It should not be
that easy to buy things on the internet,
let alone change state on the server in
other ways. So there are thankfully
other methods, but even these are
potentially vulnerable to this kind of
attack. There's a post method which is
typically used by browsers when you want
to post your credit card information or
your password to a server. You don't
want your credit card, you don't want
your password typically ending up in the
URL of your browser for privacy sake. So
rather post will kind of hide it more
deeply in that virtual envelope to which
we keep alluding. Post might also be
used if you want to upload images or
video files to a server because those
don't really fit in URLs it would seem.
And so post is an alternative that is
meant to change state on the server. For
instance, buy products for you. But even
this can perhaps be abused. Well, let's
take a look how. Here is now some HTML.
And it's more HTML than we've seen thus
far. But well, we'll wrap our minds
around each piece of it. That is
represents an alternative implementation
of the buy now button on Amazon. That's
no longer a simple anchor tag with
everything that's needed in the URL.
This is more of a traditional web form
and it's fine if the form is super short
and only has a single button. It doesn't
need text fields or anything like that,
but there's a lot going on here. So,
let's see. So, here's the form tag, the
opening tag. Here's the close tag. So,
everything in between must be
implementing this form. The action of
this form I claim is going to be to
submit the information to this
Amazon.com URL here. But the method that
we're going to use is explicitly post.
So it turns out in an HTML form if you
don't specify a method it will use get
by default. So explicitly I'm at least
using post because I don't want
everything to be in the URL alone. Well,
I've got two inputs here. One of which
is of type hidden. Well, what's going on
here? Well, it turns out that in HTML
forms, you can create like key value
pairs to send input to a server. So if
you recall previously, I used the DP uh
part of the URL as separating Amazon.com
from the product ID. And here and now
I'm making this up for the sake of
discussion. I'm supposing that Amazon
supports a web form uh name called DP
that's whose type is hidden because it
can be it doesn't the user doesn't need
to see this but the value is that same
product ID. So this is an alternative to
embedding that product ID in the URL.
Instead, I'm saying there's an HTML uh
there's an HTTP parameter called DP, the
value of which will be this, but it's
hidden. So, the user doesn't even see
it, which is fine because the whole
point is a nice simple buy now button.
How do we get that button? We use a
button tag in HTML, the type of which is
to submit because its purpose in life is
to submit this form. And the text that
the user sees for this button is indeed
by now. So, what am I doing? This will
make more sense admittedly to those of
you who've already studied a bit of web
development, who have written HTML
yourself, but I'm essentially making it
harder for an adversary to automate an
attack on a user's Amazon account. Why?
Because I am not just using a link
anymore that the user might click or a
URL that could be subtly hidden in an
image tag. Now I have an actual web form
and at least based on my naive
understanding of HTML at the moment in
this story, this would seem to require
that a human click an actual button.
Like I cannot use this as the source of
an image. It's not a URL. It's all of
this complexity. So if you're familiar
with get versus post, you might be
inclined to think that okay, post surely
solves the problem by using this web
form because you have to you make sure
in this way that someone clicks the
button before they can buy anything. Now
why is that indeed naive? Well, it turns
out using not just HTML, but this
language we've seen a little bit of
today, namely JavaScript, can be used to
automate the process of submitting a
form. So if an adversary now has this
HTML in their website, they don't have
to wait and hope that someone like you
or me is going to come along and click
the button explicitly because that would
be a little weird to click a button
thinking you're going to buy something
now, but it's not on the actual
Amazon.com. That alone doesn't matter.
If the adversary can just trick you into
visiting their website and their website
contains this HTML and this additional
JavaScript,
they can immediately submit this form
for you to Amazon without you clicking a
thing. Why? Well, inside of this script
tag that I've added down below, I've
simply said document bracket zero. So,
this means get me the first form on the
page. And I'm presuming there's only one
in this story. and then submit it. So
this is to say in JavaScript, not only
can you do things like trigger alerts on
the screen, those dialogue windows, you
can similarly through code automatically
submit forms. So it doesn't matter that
you're using post. It doesn't matter
that you have an actual button that must
be clicked. It doesn't have to be a
human that clicks that button. It can be
their browser automatically executing
this JavaScript code in the adversar's
website that just submits that form for
them. So this is the essence now of a
cross-sight request forgery. If HTML
like this exists in the adversaries
website, some other website, you can
nonetheless trick users into executing
operations across websites on Amazon.com
in this case, even though the users
themselves are not on Amazon.com. So
that's the cross-sight aspect of these
attacks. And it's a request forgery in
the sense that it's sending all of the
right information, but it's forged by
the adversary. It's not coming from the
Amazon.com developers themselves. But it
is this simple because if Amazon does
not defend against this attack, there is
nothing stopping you or me or any
adversary from including code like this
on our websites, somehow tricking users
into visiting our websites and boom,
having products sent to them
automatically, assuming they have an
Amazon.com account and they're al
already logged into it in another tab or
at least earlier in the day, for
instance.
All right, any questions now on this
particular attack? These cross-sight
request forgeries, whether implemented
using get with simple URLs or even
implemented with post using actual
forms.

security?
>> Quantum computing. Uh let me address
that another time because I dare say
that's a bit far from today's goals. Uh
but uh quantum computing is bad if the
bad guys have it and you and I don't.
I'll put it that way. All right. So, how
can we defend against this threat even
when there's JavaScript code
automatically inducing submission of
these forms which have enough
information in them in order to buy
something on our behalf? Well, it turns
out that we could include something like
a special token. And it turns out a
common way to address this problem is by
having the server not just output a
simple HTML form, but to output a an
HTML form that additionally has another
value, often hidden as well. And by
convention, in some worlds, it's called
the CSRF token, which is just a fancy
way of saying in an extra value, but its
value is typically meant to be random.
And I've chosen something fairly
pronouncable here. 1 2 3 4 ABC D. But
assume that that value is randomly
generated by the server. And it might
have a bunch of numbers, a bunch of
letters in it. But the point is that
it's randomly generated by the server.
Now, why is this important? The
implication of this mechanism by having
a web server output not only the product
ID and also the button inside of a form
that they might be using to implement
this buy now feature. The point is that
the server should also be generating
some secret randomly generated piece of
information in that server as well in
that HTML as well and the server should
remember that value as by using its own
database or some other mechanism. The
point here though is that only the
server, Amazon.com in this case, knows
what that value should be for you, a
specific user. And so an adversary, even
if they trick you into visiting their
website where they have HTML that looks
quite like this, the adversary, unless
they've hacked Amazon.com, which is not
part of this story, they would have no
idea what this random value is that
Amazon.com is using for your buy now
buttons. Because again, if it's just an
adversary on the internet, they haven't
taken over amazon.com. They haven't
taken over your computer itself, they
are just trying to trick you into ex
into visiting a web page of their own
that has HTML like this. They won't know
what value to put there. Now they can
try to guess and maybe they could guess
1 2 3 A 1 2 3 4 ABC D. But assuming it's
more random than that, the odds that
that adversary guesses your CSRF token
value is just so small and low
probability that it's just not going to
happen realistically. So now even if you
visit a web page that contains this
HTML, even if it has some JavaScript
that automatically submits the form,
because the adversary doesn't know the
value of this CSRF token, Amazon.com can
just ignore the request to buy that
product now. And they can throw up an
error message or say something went
wrong or the like. But the point is that
only the real Amazon.com should be able
to generate and remember this CSRF token
value. And so therefore they can
validate server side that it's indeed
you who intends to buy something. Now
the adversary if they put a blank value
there or any other value it's not going
to be validated server side because the
server realizes uh that's not the value
I'm using for David. That's not the
value I'm using for you. So this is a
very common technique. It does require a
bit more complexity on the server. Very
often programming languages like Python
will come with libraries, thirdparty
libraries or code that other people have
written that allow you to add this
functionality to your own software. But
you have to know that the thread exists
and you have to look for a solution
there too or implement it yourself uh if
need be but almost always as a library
the answer to this problem. There's
another way you can solve this same
problem which doesn't involve outputting
any HTML at all. It is also possible to
send these kinds of tokens as HTTP
headers as well as might commonly be the
case when a website is very heavily
using JavaScript and is using JavaScript
to talk directly to a server without
even any HTML. Well, the same values can
be sent via this other mechanism as
well. So if you're interested in these
kinds of websentric attacks especially,
you might find it interesting to explore
the open worldwide application security
project which has documentation of
discussion of recommendations for all of
these kinds of web centric attacks and
more. For now though, let's go ahead and
take a short break and when we come back
we'll look at problems that go beyond
the world of the web, specifically the
software that you might have running on
your own Macs, PCs or phones.
All right, we're back. Let's now
consider a class of attacks that is
particularly common when it comes to
software that's running on your own Mac
or your PC or your phone. So, not web-
based, but local instead. And the first
of those is generally called arbitrary
code execution. The potential for an
adversary to somehow trick your own
computer into executing code that you,
the adversary, have written and that's
not embedded in the actual software
that's meant to execute it. This is an
example more generally of what might be
called uh remote code execution whereby
the same attack can happen even if the
adversary is somewhere else in the world
perhaps connected to you somehow via the
internet. And how might these attacks be
possible? Very very common mechanism for
waging these kinds of attacks whereby an
adversary tricks your own system into
executing code that the adversary wrote
is through something generally known as
a buffer overflow. Now, to be fair, this
is a topic you would explore in more
detail in a class on uh programming,
specifically computer science more
generally, but we'll give you a highle
sense of what the threat is as it
relates to software that might very well
be running on your own computer. So,
what is a buffer overflow? Well, for
this, we need a a mental model for
what's going on inside of your computer
when running a program. And when you
double click a program on your Mac or PC
or your phone and it opens up and loads
into the computer's memory, the memory
you can think of is that this big
rectangular region that represents all
of the bytes or megabytes or gigabytes
that are in your Mac, your PC or your
phone. And the computer or device more
generally uses different parts of this
memory for different purposes. And this
is just because humans came up with
conventions years ago to lay out the
computer's memory in this way. using
some of it up here for one purpose,
using some of the memory down here for
another purpose instead. So for
instance, if this big rectangle
represents your phone or your computer's
memory, let me just propose that at the
top of it, so to speak, although memory
doesn't have a top, bottom, left, or
right because it totally depends on how
you're holding it. But assume
conceptually that at the top of your
computer's memory, is the machine code
for the program you're running. So, long
story short, when you write software, at
the end of the day, zeros and ones are
involved. And the zeros and ones
represent the instructions or commands
that that software wants to execute on
your computer. When you click an icon or
double click an icon and load a program
into memory, the actual program's
machine code, the zeros and ones, if you
will, are stored up here in your
computer's memory. Meanwhile, while a
program is running, it might need more
or less additional memory as it executes
instructions therein. So what does this
mean? Well, if the program is prompting
you for input, or if it needs to load a
new level from a game, it might need
more and more memory, but eventually it
might not need that memory anymore. So
the memory requirements of a program
tend to go up and down all the time
based on what you, the human, are doing
with the software and based on what the
software is designed to do. So computers
typically use this bottom area of the
computer's memory for a so-called stack.
Very similar in spirit to any physical
thing that you might stack one on top of
the other, like clothes in a closet or
trays in a cafeteria. Stacking means
literally from bottom on up. But the
weird thing is about a computer's memory
is that by convention, when the computer
needs memory, it first uses some memory
from the very bottom. And then if it
needs more, it uses more above that.
when it needs more, it uses more above
that. So instead of just going top to
bottom, it actually deliberately by
design goes bottom up for reasons we
won't get into in this course, but just
take on faith that indeed this stack of
memory grows upward. The catch though is
that sometimes software doesn't
necessarily know in advance or predict
correctly in advance how much input you,
the human might give it. So for
instance, a computer program might
decide to take up this much memory at
the bottom, but then not realize that,
oh wait a minute, what if the human
types in a really long name or a really
long essay or just gives me more
keystrokes as input than I, the
programmer who wrote this software,
anticipated, that might mean that even
as you allocate what are called uh
frames of memory on this stack, the
user's input might not stay confined to
that particular frame. if they type in
too many characters at their keyboard,
what's supposed to go here might end up
going down here. So overflowing these
frames of memory. So the computer or the
programmer makes a hopefully an educated
guess as to how much input the user
might have. But if they're wrong, that
input might be too tall and therefore
overlap other parts of the computer's
memory. Now, there are ways to defend
against this. So the scenario we're
worried about here is often when
programmers don't know how to anticipate
this or when you are using software
written by programmers who didn't
anticipate or implement the solution
properly. So what might go wrong? Well,
for instance, when a program first
starts running, one of the first things
it does if it's calling a another
routine or another function, when you
click on a button, when you start typing
keystrokes, the computer might start
using some of this memory, and it might
be moving around among these zeros and
ones, executing different instructions.
If you click this menu option, it'll use
this code. If you click on this menu
option, it'll use this code. So in other
words, the computer logically is kind of
moving around among all those zeros and
ones and executing them accordingly. So
one of the first things your computer
does when a program is running is it
just jotss down at the bottom of the
computer's memory what is the address to
which I should return after doing this.
So it's kind of like in the real world
if you go off and do something over
there eventually you want to remember to
come back over here to pick up where you
left off. And that's what we mean by
return address. It's a little reminder
to yourself that no matter what you go
off and do right now, you got to come
back and resume where you left off. And
what this return address then does is it
refers to some specific location in the
machine code, some specific pattern of
zeros and ones that eventually the
software should come back to to pick up
when the user uh leaves off. So for
instance, if you open uh the file menu
and go to print and you go through the
steps of printing a document, the return
address might be to go back to whatever
you were doing in that document before
you initiated the print command. So the
software is constantly jumping around in
this sense. Suppose now that the user
clicks some button within the software
to search for something. Maybe it's like
cats. Well, because this is a new uh
function that's being called the search
function, what the computer might do
inside of its memory is this. It might
put a little note to self to say go back
to this location in the machine code
once the user is done searching just
like the user might be done printing.
And then suppose the user types in cats.
Well, cats is stored in the computer's
memory just above this frame on the
stack. Because again I said by
convention whenever the software uses
memory it starts at the bottom then goes
up then goes up then goes up. So after
now this software is done searching
itself for cats. Then that frame on the
stack is sort of removed because we
don't need to know about cats anymore.
We're done searching for them. So the
last thing in memory is this reminder go
to machine code. And this is how the
software knows to go back to a
particular location in code or maybe
it's just sitting there waiting for me
to click some other menu option instead.
But what if an adversary is the one at
the keyboard, so to speak, and it's not
a good user just typing in short phrases
like cats, but maybe it's an adversary
who's typing something more. So suppose
that an adversary actually pulls up the
search feature and in general therefore
the software is going to remember to put
the return address there. So
specifically something like go to this
location in the machine code. But
suppose that the adversary doesn't type
in cats, doesn't type in dogs, but types
in for the sake of discussion some
pattern of zeros and ones that
represents actual code. Maybe it's the
pattern of zeros and ones that
represents delete everything from a
server or start sending emails or the
like. Or maybe more cleverly, maybe it
means skip whatever menu keeps prompting
me to register or activate my software.
In other words, the adversary wants to
trick the software into running zeros
and ones that didn't come with the
software. Now, in practice, you can't
just type zeros and ones at the
keyboard. It would be a different way
that the adversary inputs this data. But
for the sake of discussion, assume that
the adversary is not typing in cats, but
is typing in these zeros and ones. And
they know enough about binary zeros and
ones that they know what patterns to
choose to choose. Now suppose that this
code, this so-called attack code is way
longer than C A TS and it's many more
characters or bytes long. It is possible
by definition of how memory is used that
this attack code might be so big that it
takes up not only this space that's been
allocated for it, but it overflows
other things in memory. You can now
think of this frame, this rectangular
region on the stack to which I keep
referring is like a buffer, a room for
some amount of information. But if the
adversary provides so much information,
so much attack code zeros and ones that
it overflows that buffer, it might
actually overwrite that note to self
with dot dot dot something else. And
what's clever here though is that if the
adversary is smart enough, and this is
often through lots and lots of trial and
error, they don't often just get it the
first time. If the adversary is
ultimately clever enough, they can
actually put not just some random zeros
and ones there, but they can put the
equivalent of a note to self that says
go to attack code. In other words,
instead of typing in cats, they type in
two things that are pretty long. One are
the zeros and ones that represent some
form of attack like uh circumvent the
registration or the activation for this
software so I can use it for free or do
something else that's malicious. And if
the second thing they provide in just so
happens to be cleverly the address of
their own attack code, which they can
figure out mathematically, perhaps
through trial and error, the adversary
can trick the computer into not going
back up here and running the machine
code that came with the software. The
adversary can trick the software into
executing code that the adversary
themselves injected. Now, what does that
mean? If you are running this software
under your username, whatever you can do
on the software and the system, be it
your Mac or PC or phone, so now can the
adversary. And maybe they'll now delete
all of your files. Maybe they will now
all um register this software. Maybe
they will now start sending spam.
Anything at all is possible based on
what the adversary has passed in here.
So if you've ever heard of a website
called stackoverflow.com which is a
popular website for programmers to ask
questions and get answers of a community
that specifically is the illusion to
exactly this kind of bug or mistake
whereby if not programmed properly the
stack can overflow and if the software
or programmer does not anticipate or
detect it bad things can happen. You can
have arbitrary code executed or you can
have remote code executed if the
adversary isn't even at that keyboard
but is somehow sending this code into
your software via some network
connection. What then uh might this
mean? So, if you've ever heard of the
term cracking, which typically refers to
figuring out someone's password or in
this case breaking into software,
cracking might refer to eliminating the
need for a serial number or an
activation code or the like. Because if
you can inject any software you any code
that you want into someone's software,
you could tell that software to just
skip the lines of code, the zeros and
ones that represent asking you for that
activation code or they can do something
much more malicious. So this is an
example in some sense of what we might
also call reverse engineering. Reverse
engineering refers to the ability for
someone to figure out how something was
engineered, how it was built. Now, at
the end of the day, most of the software
that you and I install on our Macs or
PCs or phones is pretty much just zeros
and ones. So, it's very nonobvious to an
adversary even what is actually going
on. But with certain techniques, with
certain trial and error, they can
actually figure out what those zeros and
ones represent. And depending on the
language that was used to generate that
software, they might be able to glean
even more information than that. Now
there's a good side of reverse
engineering whereby if you and I are in
the business of figuring out how malware
was implemented so that you and I can
contribute solutions to antivirus
software and the like. Well, malware
analysis uses these same kinds of
techniques trying to figure out what's
going on underneath the hood of software
as by reverse engineering it. So using
trial and error, maybe injecting some
code of our own to figure out exactly
what instructions are embedded among all
of those zeros and ones.
Now, how might you hedge against these
kinds of threats of remote code
execution, arbitrary code execution with
software of your own? Well, you could
start using open-source software. For
instance, open- source software just
means that the code that implements that
software, be it in Python or PHP or Java
or C or C++ or any number of other
languages, is itself open source. That
is you and I and anyone on the internet
typically can read the source code and
see exactly what instructions will be
executed on your computer or phone. Now,
that doesn't necessarily mean that the
version of the software that you are
running is exactly the same as the
open-source version. there's still a
threat whereby the code might be open-
source, but maybe you were tricked via
some fishing email or some malicious
website and into installing a fake
version of some software that actually
has malicious code in it. So malware
might still be a problem. But a lot of
folks think that open- source tends to
be a good thing because you can audit
smart people on the internet can audit
the code and make sure that there are no
back doors or malicious instructions
that might do things that you wouldn't
expect the software to do. Now again,
that's not necessarily the case that the
version you're running doesn't still
have some form of infection, but this
might give you at least a bit more
reassurance. Now, the flip side though
is that if code is open source, even if
it's devoid of anything malicious, it
might still have bugs, mistakes that
human programmers accidentally made,
which might very well make open- source
software or any software vulnerable to
attack. I mean, you're literally giving
the ad adversaries the plans to your
software. It's like the plans to the
Death Star in Star Wars such that they
can probably figure out what the
weaknesses are in your software because
you're giving them the blueprint there
for. So, an alternative to open source
software is perhaps the default which is
closed software. So, any software that
you might download or buy from companies
that it's not open source is typically
closed source which means only they only
their employees have access to it. Now
the downside is that you the user do not
have access to closed source software.
Only the authors therefore do. But the
upside arguably is that now so do
adversaries on the internet not have
access to it. So maybe the probability
that that software not only has mistakes
but those mistakes are exploited is
perhaps lower. And so this is perhaps
more of a debate and you yourselves as
you consider this might have require
your own opinions on open source versus
closed source. But another argument in
favor of open source is often that with
so many people around the world having
eyes on software perhaps that actually
increases the probability that we will
detect bugs or detect potential exploits
uh because so many more smart people are
looking at it and therefore weighing in.
The downside of course if one of those
smart people is an adversary they find
it and don't tell anyone then we're back
to a problem from a previous class
wherein we discussed those zeroday
attacks. But this is one way, one mental
model you might have for evaluating just
how secure your own software might be
that you're either using as a user or
developing as a company. What's another
way that you might gain some assurance
that the software you're installing and
using is not infected with some form of
vulnerability or uh malicious intent.
Well, you could download all of the
software that you use only from an
approved app store. Be it in the world
of iPhones or Android devices, Mac OS,
Windows, or the like, whereby you have
some other entity like a Google, an
Apple, or a Microsoft, a big company
that is at least analyzing the
applications that are being uploaded to
these app stores before they're allowed
to be distributed to people like you and
me. Now, that's not to say that Apple
and Microsoft and Google's or others are
perfect. There have absolutely been many
cases where even applications in these
app stores has some malicious feature
that they only realize after the fact.
But again, it's probably put increasing
the probability that some smart people
or automated software is going to detect
those things first before it even
reaches your device. And therefore, it
makes it harder for the adversary.
Raises the bar, raises the cost, raises
the risk to them to even get something
like that distributed. So what does this
mean? Well, when you install software on
your computer, perhaps you should get it
only from Microsoft or Google or Apple
and not from some random website and
certainly not from some random email
that someone sent you with a link to
download some piece of software. Now,
that's not always going to be the case.
And particularly if you yourself are an
aspiring programmer, a software
developer, you might need to be in the
habit of installing sort of unauthorized
software for which you might have to
jump through some hoops and change some
settings in your phone or your in your
Mac or PC to even allow you to install
unauthorized software if you know what
you're doing. But these kinds of
mechanisms even though they create uh
dissatisfaction with this idea of a
walled garden whereby you need some
corporate entity's permission just to
distribute your software they do serve a
good purpose as well. So there too you
might fall on one side or the other of
that sort of argument too. Now how do
those app stores enforce uh the fact
that you can only install the software
if it is in the app store itself? Well,
it turns out we can revisit some of our
primitives from past classes whereby we
talked about encryption and also uh
hashing and also digital signatures. The
latter of two are particularly germanine
here. It turns out that cryptography
really is the solution to a lot of the
world's current problems when it comes
to cyber security. If we use these
primitives, hashing, encryption, and
digital signing as building blocks to
solutions. So for instance, when you
develop a piece of software or some
company does this for you and they
upload their software to Apple or Google
or Microsoft for distribution, what are
those companies doing? Well, first you
as the design uh as the author of the
software are first using your own public
and private key which you came up with
in advance and you are running your
software through some special function
or algorithm and getting back a hash
thereof. Again, a hash is this fixed
length representation of your software.
So even if you wrote a really big
program, you have this unique identifier
or highly probably unique identifier
called a hash. And what you can then do
with that hash is use your private key
and sign that hash giving you a digital
signature. That signature can be
verified by Google or Microsoft or Apple
as being okay. I know that David Mailen
wrote this software because I know that
only he has that private key and so long
as I David Men registered my public key
with Apple or Google or Microsoft in
advance they can assume that okay this
new version of the software or this new
program came from David Men and not from
some random person on the internet
pretending to be David Men. Conversely,
what uh Google and Microsoft and and uh
Apple and others can do is the same
thing. Once you have uploaded your
software to their app store, they can
ensure that they run the software
through the same function uh getting
back a hash thereof, a unique
representation thereof. They can use
their own private key from their own app
store to take that hash's input and
produce a digital signature this time
signed by Apple or Microsoft or Google
who or whoever else is running the app
store. And then when you or I install
that software on our Mac and our PC or
on our phones, our phones and devices
can ensure that any software you and I
are installing on our device was
digitally signed by that app store by
Google or Microsoft or Apple or the
like. So again, just by using this basic
building block of digital signatures and
hashing in this case, you can both
attest in one direction that I am David
Men. you tr uh trust my software is
written from me. Conversely, when people
install my software, they can trust if
Apple or Google or Microsoft or others
trust that software that they should
indeed be allowed to doubleclick it. And
it's only when you download some
unauthorized software uh from the
internet typically that you get often
nowadays on your screen an alert saying
this has not been signed or this is from
an unauthorized third party developer or
the like if they're not playing nicely
in this same ecosystem. But again
digital signatures take us a long way
there. So another mechanism you can
consider which is similar in spirit but
typically terminology that's used in the
world of Linux computers or or similar
are package managers and different
programming languages also come with an
ecosystem of libraries thirdparty code
that people write and they make freely
available often as open source but
there's standard ways via which these
package managers can let you and me
install the software on our own Macs PCs
phones or the like and it's using tools
like pip for Python on gem for Ruby, npm
for Node.js, and there's others as well,
apt for Linux. These package managers
though typically adopt a very similar
mechanism whereby they are digitally
signing these packages so that you and I
can have our computers verify those
signatures before they're actually
allowed to be installed. And in general,
this this involves operating systems as
well. the operating systems that you and
I are running nowadays, at least if you
stayed current and are in the habit of
automatic updates or frequent manual
updates. Odds are today's more modern
operating systems are increasingly
building in native support for these
kinds of checks. Downside is it's
getting a little more difficult, a
little more annoying to install
third-party software on our devices. But
the upside is that if you trust these
app stores, these package managers, then
by transitivity, you can with higher
probability trust the software being
distributed there too. Now this too
though is not failafe and it has often
happened that even once software has
been uploaded to these app stores or
package managers and made available to
folks and version one might be perfectly
safe, version two might be perfectly
safe, version three might be malicious
for some reason. Maybe the developer
finally decided to do what their
intention was all along. Maybe the
developer, and this has happened too,
sold their software to someone else and
the third party now is adding ads or
something malicious to it. Or someone
has hacked their computer or account and
gained access to their private key and
not just their public key and therefore
masquerading as them. So even now, you
can't necessarily trust the software
you're running on your computer. But
again, that brings us back to some of
our earliest lessons in the class where
what we're really trying to do is raise
the bar to the adversary, increase the
cost, increase the risk to them, and
conversely decrease the probability to
us that any one of these pieces of
software might actually be malicious.
Now, there are models that the world has
been experimenting with over time to try
to figure out how best to reduce these
probabilities further. And there's this
notion of bug bounties whereby some
companies will actually steer in to the
reality that there are people out there
with the skills not only to do malicious
things with their software but also good
things as well. For instance, people who
might very well want to try to find bugs
in software, particularly ones that
relate to security, if they know that
the company in whose software they're
discovering these bugs is willing to pay
for it. And not in a ransom sense, not
in a malicious ransom sense, but in a
bounty sense whereby there tends to be
this marketplace for some companies and
some products whereby if you do discover
a bug in their software and you disclose
it only to the designers of the
software, at least during some window of
time before you tell the world about it,
they will pay you. So that once they
they can therefore fix the bug, then pay
out because it's a net positive for
everyone. Win-win. you have benefited,
they have benefited and hopefully no
adversaries have found it first. And
depending on the severity of these bugs,
you might get paid more or less based on
the same. And so the idea here of these
bug bounty programs is to try to
leverage the collective intelligence and
technical skill of people who frankly
without these programs maybe would be
using their skills for evil and trying
to hack these systems and monetize them
through ransomware. But perhaps we could
channel those funds instead toward
paying people to do this kind of work.
So this too is something to consider not
so much as a user using software but
perhaps a company developing software.
So where can you learn more and what has
the world come up with to keep track of
like all of these possible threats and
what we focused on today really are
representative attacks using some
languages and technologies that are
quite omnipresent and fairly accessible
at least at the level we've explained
them. But it turns out that there is a
whole inventory of vulnerabilities that
have been detected over the years,
common vulnerabilities and exposures or
CVE such that a lot of the kinds of
attacks we've been talking about today
and more specifically bugs and flaws in
specific software and versions thereof
are often assigned a unique identifier,
a CVE number that system administrators,
companies, and even end users can keep
track of to make sure they are always
current with the latest threats out
there. There is also a common
vulnerability scoring system or CBSS
which is a standardized way of assigning
a score to the severity of a
vulnerability. Is it a big deal or is it
not so much a big deal? It might still
be a vulnerability, a bug, but is it
that problematic? And so there's this
scale so that you can prioritize for for
instance given limited resources or time
which of the bugs you should be fixing,
which of the software you should be
updating or maybe which of the software
you should not be using at least while
it's vulnerable to something that's
highly severe. There's an exploit
prediction scoring system out there,
EPSS, which refers to what do people in
the real world think the probability is
that this particular bug or mistake in
software will be exploited is. Um, and
this uh then might give you a sense of
just how problematic it is. Even if
there's something very severe, is it
more of a hypothetical threat or an
actual threat? Something that IT people
might indeed take into account when
designing how to respond to some system.
And then there's a known exploited
vulnerability catalog, AEV, which refers
to all of these kinds of bugs that are
known to have been exploited. So,
suffice it to say, here we're now seeing
evidence of just how big of a world, how
big of a space cyber security is, that
we have all of these lists and
taxonomies for keeping track of things.
Because if you're feeling a little
overwhelmed with just some of the
concepts, imagine just how many
hundreds, thousands of actual threats
and uh vulnerabilities there are in the
actual wild. All right, so that's a
whole lot of threats to the security of
your software, whether you're using it
as a user or writing it as a developer.
But hopefully by way of today's examples
of how software works, how adversaries
can take advantage of it, and how you
can defend against it, you have a much
better sense of how to manage those
threats. Up ahead is how we might now
preserve our own privacy. More on that
next time.
All right, this is CS50's introduction
to cyber security. My name is David Men
and this week, let's focus on preserving
privacy. Indeed, over the past several
weeks, we focused on securing your
accounts, your data, your systems, your
software, and all of that is really
about keeping communications between
points A and B, for instance, secure so
that no one in between can actually
access the information you're trying to
share. But what if you A don't even want
B to have some of that information. So
indeed today, let's focus on some of the
technologies that you and I use every
day and some of the technologies that
underly the tech uh the software and
applications and more that you and I are
going to use tomorrow and beyond and
consider exactly what information we're
sharing now perhaps even without our
knowledge and also empower you with
certain mechanisms via which you can
perhaps restrict all the more of this
information if you indeed do not want to
share it beyond yourself. So, let's
consider first some of the obvious
features that you and I probably use
every day, like your web browsing
history. Whether you're on a laptop or
desktop or mobile device, odds are you
know by now that your browser tends to
keep track of pretty much everywhere you
go on the worldwide web. That is to say,
if you click on your URL bar, you can
sometimes browse through the past few
URLs that you've visited. If you go up
to your browser's history via some menu,
you can probably see everything you've
done earlier today, yesterday, last
week, last year, or perhaps even the
entirety of your history, particularly
if you're logging into your Google
account, Microsoft or account, or
something else. So, the web browsing
history is sort of both a concern when
it comes to your privacy, but also a
feature. Well, let's first consider the
feature. Well, why is that useful? Well,
one, I mean, even I occasionally go back
through my history trying to find some
web page that I know I was looking at
earlier in the day or yesterday or some
previous time in the past because it
just helps me find information more
quickly. So, in that sense, it might
solve a problem for me. Moreover, you
probably have noticed that your web
browsing history is often used for
features like autocomplete. So when you
start typing a URL or maybe even a
keyword that was in the name of a page,
your browser might remember much more
quickly what it is you're looking for.
So you can just hit enter or click and
voila, you're at that same page. But of
course, this is a concern potentially
for your privacy whereby you might not
want someone else who has physical
access to your device to start poking
through where it is you've gone. you
might not want someone else to have
access if you just so happen to visit
that website or those websites on maybe
a a computer in a lab environment or an
internet cafe or the like. So you could
imagine quite a few scenarios in which
this is yes a feature but quite a few
other scenarios in which this is not
really a desirable feature because it
invades your privacy in some sense or at
least puts it at risk for being invaded
by someone else. So we'll consider how
we might at least sanitize this history
or remove it altogether in ways that you
might already know about. For instance,
you're probably already familiar with
some option in your browser whereby you
can clear your browser history and that
forgets therefore all of the places that
you've been in uh been all of the
cookies that you might have accumulated,
all of the usernames and passwords that
might have been remembered by your
browser. Although that tends to be a
fairly heavy-handed solution because
when you clear your browser history,
assuming you check all those boxes, like
all of it is gone. And that might mean
negatively that you're now logged out of
Google, you're now logged out of Outlook
or some other account that you actually
still want to use even if you just
wanted to clear your history from
something else altogether. So, we'll
consider then what else might be a
concern when it comes to your privacy
beyond your own browser. And in fact, it
doesn't even matter if you sanitize your
own web browsing history and delete the
entirety of it because it turns out that
typically any website you visit is
itself on the server side also keeping
track of a lot of that same information.
That is to say that servers typically
have logs and these are not only for
diagnostic purposes. in case anything
goes wrong, the IT staff can use those
logs to sort of reconstruct history and
figure it out, figure out who was doing
what and when and how that might explain
some problem. It might be used for
auditing purposes if they want to keep
track of exactly what was accessed on a
system. It might be used for advertising
purposes or analytical purposes more
generally to kind of mine or analyze
that data to figure out how we might
monetize it or do something else with
that same information. But what do we
mean concretely when we say that
information is logged on a server? Well,
it's very similar to your own web
browsing history, but it's even more
detailed. So, here for instance, is a
representative piece of configuration
that captures what it's a very common
convention for information that servers
log, web servers specifically, when you
visit them with a browser. And I'll
highlight just a subset thereof. This
log format, the so-called combined
format indicates to me that it's very
common for a server when you visit some
web page on it that the server will log
that is remember uh your remote address
otherwise known as your IP address. It
will remember the day and time at which
you access that page. It will remember
exactly what you requested. So the name
of the file or folder on the server
specifically that you sought to download
or look at. It'll remember the refer
that is the URL from which you came. and
it will even remember the user agent
that you use, that is to say, your
browser. So perhaps unbeknownst to you,
every time you use your browser to visit
some website inside of that virtual
envelope is quite a bit more than just
the requests that you're making of the
browser of the server rather. It
includes yes, your IP address and on the
outside of the envelope as we've
described it in the past. It includes
some number of HTTP headers as we've
discussed in the past, but in
particular, it includes information that
you might not want being stored on
servers in perpetuity. And you have no
control over deleting necessarily unless
there is some regulatory requirement or
law that requires that the server delete
it for you on some schedule. You have
much much less control over this
information. So let's consider in a bit
more technical detail what some of this
information is and how you might at
least exert some control over just how
much of that information is being
shared. So let's revisit first this
building block of HTTP headers that we
keep coming back to if only because in
the world of systems and software
nowadays things on the web are just so
common using HTML CSS JavaScript using
web browsers and web servers that's
driving a lot of today's interactions
with technology whether it's in native
applications or whether it's with mobile
websites or desktop websites or the
like. So, HTTP headers, recall, are just
like key value pairs that are inside of
those virtual envelopes that indicate
some kind of setting or some kind of
piece of information that the browser is
sending to the server or that the server
is sending to the browser. So, for
instance, if I go on google.com and I
search, as I often do, for cats, well,
what might be going on underneath the
hood? Well, in that web page that Google
gives me with like 10 or 20 or 30 or 6
billion240 million cats, there might be
HTML that looks like this. And recall
that this HTML, which I'm proposing
exists somewhere in Google search
results, is an anchor tag for a link.
There's the end tag over there. The
hyper reference for this link or href
attribute has a value of https
uh example.com for instance. And the
word that the human will see is cats
literally in this case. Now I'm assuming
for the sake of discussion that today
example.com is a website full of cats
and that's why it might be appearing
among Google search results when I
search for cats as my keyword. But when
a user like you or me clicks on that
link on google.com because that is
literally where you're looking at the
search results in this story. It turns
out that your browser not only goes and
requests that web page, your browser
includes an HTTP header like this in
that virtual envelope that's
specifically called referer. That's the
key in this case, the value of which is
the URL from which you came. So for
instance, if I have just gone to
google.com and I've searched for cats
and I've hit enter, recall as in past
classes I proposed that the shortest
version of the URL that you might see in
your browser upon searching for cats is
this httpsw.google.com/arch
questionark qals cats. Now that is what
you'd see in your URL bar. Below that
you'd see the 10 or the 20 or the 30 or
the 6 billion 240 million cats each of
which has a link that when clicked leads
you to a search result. But the
implication of this HTTP header is that
by default perhaps unbeknownst to you
indeed your browser is telling the whole
world from which web page you came when
you visited some other web page via a
link. Now why in the world is this
compelling? Well, it's actually useful
for the website at which you end where
because it might be useful for their
analytics. They might want to know,
well, how are people finding my website?
How are people finding my business on
the internet? Oh, it looks like I'm
getting a lot of users, a lot of
customers perhaps from google.com
specifically when someone searches for
cats, not dogs, not something else, but
cats. So you can imagine, especially in
the world of commerce, that just being
useful information to know how people
are finding you or conversely how people
are not apparently finding you. But this
is very invasive because now this
website, even though it's arguably none
of their business, they know I use
Google instead of Bing or some other
search engine perhaps. And you can
imagine that there could be links on
CS50's own website, on any number of
other websites in the world. And just
because you happen to visit them and you
clicked a link, now they're broadcasting
your business to whatever website you're
ending up on by revealing where you came
from, from where you were referred, so
to speak. But this has long been a
feature of HTTP. And this has long been
a feature that's enabled by default
unless the website or perhaps you as the
user turn this off or somehow moderate
its response. Now, some of you might be
noticing that there's a bit of a typo on
the screen, and I promise this isn't
actually mine. Um, in English, at least,
this is not typically how you spell the
word refer. And this is actually a fun
fact. In referer, there should be four
Rs in total. It should be refer r.
However, fun fact, years ago when the
specification for this standard was
being written, uh the poor individual
who wrote the specification made a typo
that has been immortalized in history
for years to come. And so this is what
browsers and servers have been using and
expecting for years. There are other
variants of this header that this
typographical error has been fixed in,
but it's sort of a fun fact from our
internet history. But this is indeed
what you might see going from your
browser to your server. So ideally, we'd
send less information at least, right?
I'd be a little more comfortable if
example.com, which is this website of
for cats, told them, ""Okay, fine. I came
from Google. That's not a big deal, but
I'd rather you not know what I was
looking for. If only because that seems
unnecessary. It seems invasive, and who
knows what kinds of cats I was looking
for. Maybe I don't want you to know
exactly what my preferences are in cats
or dogs or whatever types of breeds
there might be in this case of searching
for animals. So just feels like it's
unnecessary information to share. But
better still, I dare say would not to be
to even tell example.com where I'm
coming from and essentially just get rid
of this altogether. So how might a
website go about moderating just how
much output comes from the browsers at
the servers request? Or maybe how might
you with special software suppress some
of this information to preserve all the
more of your privacy and what it is
you're doing online? Well, for instance,
this is a common tag that web pages can
put in their own HTML code that
indicates to the browser that yes, you
may send the referring address, but only
send the origin. That is https
uh www.google.com/
and that's it. No search path, no
question mark q equals cats. Tell them
the website you came from, but not the
specific page or not the specific search
query or search results. Notice here in
the world of HTML, the typographical
error has been fixed. There's two Rs in
the middle there. But otherwise, this is
an HTML solution to the problem. The
browser, assuming it respects this HTML,
will therefore send and refer HTTP
header, but with less information, not
the whole URL, but just the origin. So
really the domain name itself and a bit
more like the protocol. If you don't
want any of that to be sent for your
users, for your customers, you could do
this instead. Now Google does not do
this. Google currently actually sends
origin, so part of the URL. But if you
want to be an even better citizen and
not make it easy for browsers to send
more information than they need to, you
can include this HTML in your page
instead, informing the browser that you
can send a don't send a referral at all
because the value of this meta tag so to
speak is actually none instead of
origin. And there are other values as
well that allow you a bit of range of
opportunities when it comes to these
settings, but these are perhaps um the
most common or ones to consider. There's
an alternative too. If you happen to be
a little more technical and you have
control over the web server and not just
the HTML on the server, you can actually
configure a referer policy HTTP header
that goes from the brow server to the
browser. So in this case the referer
policy can indicate that you only want
the origin to be sent for instance the
the shorter form of the URL or you can
actually indicate that no referer should
actually be sent in this particular
case. So a second mechanism for actually
controlling the same. Let me pause here
and see if there's uh not only some
concerns perhaps now that you understand
better hopefully how the web works at
least by default or how we might
mitigate this concern with your privacy.
>> Is there a way that is like easy enough
for us to
delete those traces as a client like in
case that we don't want to be tracked or
something like that?
>> A really good question. We'll refer you
to some URLs uh outside of the context
of class itself, but yes, there is
actually clientside software that you
can install on your own Mac or PC
typically that will scrub some of this
information so that when your HTTP
requests go from your browser to
servers, you can ensure that this
third-party software removes a lot of
that information automatically for you.
Because in that way, you don't have to
trust that the website like the Googles
of the world will actually reduce the
amount of information for you. You can
instead do that for yourself through
client side software and we'll provide a
few links online. Other questions on the
same?
>> By using a private browser such as um to
for example or using a temporary
operating system like Tails um does this
remove all of our traces on the internet
or does it leave some on the client side
or the server side?
>> A good question. Short answer is that it
does leave some evidence on both the
server side and the client side. But
we'll come back to tour in just a little
bit as well. All right. How about one
final question?
>> You said previously about the third
party software that that's used that's
supposed to be used in order to scrub
the information from being submitted to
uh to the server side. What if that
program itself is used to ease drop on
what we do in the computer?
>> That is a very valid concern. It is
absolutely possible. In general, what is
working in your favor is either open-
source software where if you're using
software that other people can see the
source code of, presumably it's less
likely that it's doing something
malicious. Capitalism often helps you
here too, whereby it is often not in a
company's own interest to be violating
the privacy of their users because
presumably that would create some form
of backlash which would not be good for
business. But beyond that, there is a
lot of trust on your part and my part
whenever it comes to installing
software. So that is indeed very much a
risk. Now it turns out there's other
information that your browser might be
sharing without you realizing that it's
making it available. And that
information is enough via which servers
can even fingerprint you, so to speak.
That is to say, there's this technique
generally called fingerprinting that in
the context of the web means to take as
input a whole bunch of characteristics
of the request from the internet that's
coming in and see if you can use those
characteristics to create a a profile of
sorts for the user via which you can
uniquely identify that user. Now, that
doesn't mean you'll know specifically
that that user is David Men, but you
will know according to this system if
it's the same user today as you see
tomorrow as you see the next day because
you can use this information to infer
with high probability that okay, we saw
that exact same browser configuration
again and again and again. Odds are it's
the same person and not some twin on the
internet who just happens to have
precisely those settings. Now, how might
this be implemented or achieved
technologically? Well, the simplest
mechanism perhaps is just to rely on
something like your IP address. Recall
that anytime you're doing something on
the internet, those virtual envelopes we
keep talking about have your IP address
on the outside, so to speak, as well as
the IP address of the destination to
which you're trying to send information.
Your IP in that case is the return
address, which means you're literally
telling the remote server when using
certain protocols where you are in the
world or at least what your IP address
is. Now that IP address might not alone
uniquely identify you because it turns
out on campuses, in homes, in corporate
networks, you might actually share one
IP address with many other people, but
it at least narrows the scope of whose
IP it might be, even if it's shared
among a few people. But your browser
inside of that virtual envelope is
sharing other information as well.
Another HTTP header that is typically
sent by browsers to servers is called
user agent. And this is just a unique
string of text that uniquely identifies
typically the browser that you're using
and the version thereof and the
operating system that you're using and
the version thereof. So for instance, a
standard format might look a little
something like this. It's deliberately
overwhelming and it's just meant to
capture how much detail might be leaked
in this header's value. But within this
big string of text that doesn't even fit
onto one line, it's wrapping here onto
three lines is some indication of what
browser you're using, be it Chrome or
something else. and what operating
system you're using, be it Android or
something else on a phone, a laptop or a
desktop. Now, of course, a lot of people
in the world presumably have the same
browser installed. So, that too even
with IP address might not be enough
information to uniquely identify you, at
least with high probability. So, what
else can servers do? Well, if the server
has the ability to send some code to
your computer, for instance, some HTML,
some CSS, and some JavaScript, servers
can effectively interrogate the browser
and ask it certain questions. For
instance, a server could figure out what
the resolution is of your screen. Now,
this might be practically useful so they
know how to render information on the
screen, but that alone might be enough,
especially if you're in the habit of uh
full screening your browser and you
always use the same resolution on your
monitor. That might be another
ingredient with which to identify or
fingerprint you. The server might be
able to figure out what fonts you have
installed on your system. The server
might be able to figure out what time
zone you are in because that's also a
value available within the context of a
browser. And there's yet other values
still that collectively with high
probability can be used to fingerprint
you and me. So, even if you're not even
logged in, even if you're using various
privacy-enhancing uh software products
to try to remove some of these HTTP
headers and the like, you're still
leaking other information, including the
extensions or plugins sometimes that
your browser might have installed. So,
if you're in the habit of using the same
computer again and again, and you're in
the habit of not changing a lot of these
settings, that alone might be enough for
a website to effectively track you. Now,
it might be innocuous. They might just
use this for statistical purposes to get
a sense of how many users or customers
they have, but it could be for more
invasive purposes like serving you
targeted advertising based on your
behavior of these websites or really
just tracking you specifically. And the
catch is that if you ever log into this
server just once, if the server has been
logging all of your traffic based on
that fingerprint for days, for months,
for years, at that point retroactively
with high probability, they can infer,
oh wait a minute, if the user on this
day was David, and we think it was the
same user on all of these previous days,
now by transitivity, they know a lot
more about your browser history as well.
So even unbeknownst to you and even
without explicit header values being
sent that identify you, the collection
of attributes or characteristics that
our browsers have and our browsing
behavior has can still be enough to
uniquely identify most of us quite a bit
of the time. Let me pause here and see
if there's any questions on
fingerprinting or these implications for
privacy.
>> Would using like a VPN prevent browser
fingerprinting?
Um, a good question and we'll talk about
VPNs a bit more soon. Short answer, no.
So, VPNs will typically mask your IP
address, but that's about it. If you
still use your browser as usual, uh,
with your user account as usual, all of
that same information is going to be
leaked. It's just going to change one
piece of it. A good question. Other
questions on fingerprinting and privacy.
Is it possible that a hacker can steal a
fingerprint and use it for their own
purposes and everything will look like
it's was my computer that perform
certain actions. So it's like uh
stealing an identity. A short answer yes
if the hacker has access to the same
information. If though if we rewind to
our focus on encryption a couple of
classes ago. If you are accessing
websites only via HTTPS and nothing is
unencrypted, then it's going to be a lot
harder for a hacker in between you and
that server to glean any of the same
information because almost all of it is
encrypted. IP address is not, but
anything inside of the envelope is,
including these headers, the HTML, the
JavaScript, and the CSS. If though the
hacker has somehow infiltrated your own
laptop or desktop or phone or the
server, then all bets are off and they
could absolutely identify you according
to these same pieces of information.
Other questions?
>> I was just curious to understand the
difference perhaps when you are on
mobile. My understanding is that they
can even get much more information uh
when you are on mobile.
>> That's a fair question. I don't think I
would answer yes to that. I'm hardressed
to imagine what more your phone is doing
than the browser is doing. Except that
there are I suppose I could argue that
your phone tends to have additional
features nowadays like GPS, like
accelerometers, uh gyroscope perhaps. So
other hardware features that
theoretically can be interrogated by
JavaScript code typically on an opt-in
basis. So you the user could deny access
to these pieces of information. But
those characteristics I suspect could be
used to identify you a bit more uniquely
because laptops at least today have less
of that functionality.
Other questions
>> when storing and retrieving data on the
front end. Is it more secure to use
cookies, local storage or another
alternative?
>> A really good question and we will come
to this subject literally in like one
slide cookies. Um, in general, local
storage because cookies by design are
meant to be sent back and forth, back
and forth between browser and server.
Theoretically, that should not be a
concern if everything is encrypted. But
we've talked in the past already how
mistakes can be made. You might start on
HTTP, be redirected to HTTPS. So, in
general, storing things in local
storage, at least prevent things from
accidentally leaking out over the
browser connection. That said, if you're
storing things in local storage, they
are literally available locally. So if
you have a colleague, a friend, a
sibling who gains physical access to
that device, let alone an adversary,
then they could see all of the
information in not only your cookies,
but also local storage. So at that
point, physical access, uh, generally
all bets are off when it comes to your
privacy.
All right, how about one other question?
>> There were calls being made from
people's local phone numbers on cell
phones to other local numbers.
Obviously, the people weren't making the
calls and it had happened to me too and
I was wondering how that uh kind of
works or if it's related to this at all.
>> Um it is uh we weren't planning to talk
about it today, but in a nutshell, it is
very easy to spoof telephone numbers. Um
and this is how a lot of spam calls are
sent particularly internationally or
abroad where they might not be regulated
in the same way as someone's home
country. Um, it's very common too for if
your number starts with your own phone
number starts with 555 for instance.
Very often you'll get fake calls from
other numbers that also start with 555
because the presumption by the adversary
is that oh Sabrina is probably more
likely to pick this up if she thinks
it's a neighbor with a similar looking
phone number. But unfortunately with the
phone system it's all too easy to fake
phone numbers. And this is yet another
reason why using phones, using SMS is
not a recommended approach for our
earlier topic about multiffactor
authentication. It's just not a secure
network. That's not how Edison and
others designed it 100 plus years ago.
This is why systems that use
cryptography in some form are much safer
when it comes to that information.
All right. So beyond this user agent
header, there's other headers that your
browser is often sending back and forth
with the server. And one of these we've
talked about and one of these you
probably came into the course knowing
about, namely cookies. But there are
different types of cookies. But recall
that in general a cookie is a piece of
information that a server puts on your
computer to help remember who you are.
So in the absence of these fingerprints,
in the absence of specific headers like
these, it can just put a small random
value with numbers and letters or the
like on your computer or maybe even a
bigger value if it has lots of users and
it uses that value to uniquely identify
you. If you return again and again to
the website, it doesn't necessarily know
that I am David unless I log in at some
point, at which point then it can
realize, oh, wait a minute, David's
cookie is this value. Now I know who
this user is. But in general, there are
different types of cookies and different
settings for cookies that are worth
knowing a little something about. So we
talked previously about what we'd more
properly call session cookies. So
session cookies are used by servers to
maintain state so to speak between the
server and the browser. That is to say
without getting too technical HTTP is
typically stateless whereby when you
visit a page the browser icon might spin
for a bit and then it stops because the
transaction between the browser and the
server is complete. But if you want to
remember who the user is, therefore the
second, the third, the fourth time the
browser contacts the server, the browser
had better remind the server who it is.
And this is why we use the metaphor of
the the virtual handstamp whereby that
handstamp is like the browser's way of
reminding the server, you've seen me
before. Don't make me log in again. I am
David. I am David. even though it's just
relying on this virtual handstamp or
really some unique identifier that's
going in the cookie header from browser
to server. So a session cookie allows
browsers and servers to maintain
sessions. This kind of state a little
more concretely, it allows them to
maintain things like shopping cart. So
if you're shopping on an Amazon.com or
the like, the session cookie is what
remembers who you are or at least that
you're the same person. so that every
time you poke around on the website,
Amazon shows you the same contents of
your shopping cart again and again so
that they don't lose your business by
accidentally deleting it when you simply
change the page. So, how does session
cookies work? Well, when you first visit
a website that wants to plant a cookie
on your computer, the response might
look a little something like this. HTTP
200 is the status code, which recall
means okay, all is well. It's not
something like 404, which would mean
file not found. So 200 is okay. But the
server might also respond with this key
value pair, this HTTP header set-cookie
colon. So that's the key, the value of
which is session equals 1 2 3 4 ab cd.
And that's the same value we used
previously when we talked about cookies
in this context. And the point here is
that the name of this cookie is session
and its uh value equals in this case 1 2
3 4 abc d. Now, if you visit the same
website and you and you and you, we
would all have different seemingly
random values for those cookies. And so,
this number, this sequence of letters
and numbers would be different for each
of us. That is to say, we have different
handstamps that we're presenting each
time. Now, this is a session cookie, and
it's a session cookie in the sense that
it is supposed to expire when you close
the browser, when you quit for the
night, when you reboot, or anything
else. Now, with that said, that's a bit
of an overstatement because browsers
nowadays will frequently uh preserve
your tabs for you. They might go to
sleep. You might have to wake them back
up, but increasingly sessions are living
longer than they once did. But the idea
is that this is not meant to last for
like a year or forever. It has a much
shorter lif uh lifetime by design. When
your browser has received that cookie
and you click on some other page, you
visit some other product on Amazon.com,
your browser might say something like
this. Get slash and then cookie colon
that exact same value. So recall from
our previous class, this is how the
browser just reminds the server what its
handstamp is or what its cookie value
is. But again the idea is that when the
browser is closed you reboot for the
night uh then you should not uh have the
same session cookie tomorrow at least in
this model. That's not true for all
websites, but according to cookies as we
are currently using them. Now, that's
pretty good for your privacy because if
the cookie is by design meant to be a
session cookie and it sort of expires
pretty soon when you're done with that
browser tab or done using the browser
for the day, then that's pretty good
because it means if you go back to the
same website tomorrow, that cookie might
not exist anymore. So, you might as well
look like or be a brand new user. So,
they can't correlate perhaps by default
as much information about you. But these
are the cookies that you read about uh
being bad for you and bad for your
privacy tracking cookies which are the
exact same idea. Key value pairs that
are sent from server to browser to
remember who you are or at least that
you're the same person even if we don't
know that you're David Men specifically
just yet. But as per the name tracking
cookies are really designed to track you
and me. Why? Well, maybe analytical
purposes, maybe debugging purposes so
that they know where users were in case
something breaks. maybe advertising
purposes so that you get served
different ads from me so that they can
maximize their revenue by click serving
up ads that you and I are each more
individually likely to click on. So
tracking cookies are the ones that get a
bad rep and rightfully so. So let's
consider an example of a cookie that's
designed to track your behavior on a
particular website. Here for instance is
a set cookie header that Google
specifically might send to your browser.
In fact, they use a cookie that by
convention is called underscorega GA for
Google Analytics, which they use for
analytical purposes. And its value looks
a little something like this. And the
point of this value is that it's
generated on a per website basis if that
website is using Google Analytics. And
Google Analytics is a tool that allows
uh website designers to track who is
clicking on what, what browsers they're
using, what operating systems they're
using, and generally giving them a sense
of the demographics of their user base.
But unlike session cookies which are
meant to expire after a day after the
browser closes or the like Google's
analytical cookie here has a maximum age
of this many seconds which if you do out
the math is by default 2 years which is
to say if you visit some website that is
using Google Analytics by embedding a
bit of Google's JavaScript code in their
website whenever that Google code is
pulled from Google's website Google has
an opportunity to plant this cookie
on your computer and you'll get a unique
ID based on you visiting for the first
time based on the specific website that
is embedding Google Analytics and that
cookie is going to live in your computer
according to this HTTP header for as
long as 2 years. Now, that's useful for
Google. It's perhaps useful for the
website. It's perhaps a little more
invasive for me and you. Now, Google has
many other cookies that they use, too,
but this is perhaps one that you should
keep an eye out for. And indeed, in the
coming weeks or months, if you poke
around some of your own browser
settings, you might very well see values
like this.
But what else might servers use to keep
track of us? Especially if you and I are
in the habit of deleting our cookies or
clearing your history, which would be
counterproductive for Google or websites
that are trying to track you in this
way, but a plus for you and and for my
privacy if you're behaving in this way.
But it turns out there's other ways
servers can track us, including through
HTTP parameters, tracking parameters. So
parameters are the key value pairs that
often appear in URLs that are sent via
get requests typically. So we've seen
one of these. If you recall when we've
searched for cats on Google before, you
might recall that the URL was something
like httpsw.google.com/arch
question mark q equals cats. Anything
after a question mark in a URL is indeed
an HTTP parameter, but it could be used
not for innocuous helpful purposes like
searching for cats, but also to track
you. And in fact, if you see amperands
in URLs, that might mean that you have a
second or a third or more parameter up
there. And sometimes these per the
purpose of these parameters is simply to
track you as some person. So for
instance, here is a representative URL.
It's a long one and this is taken with
from example.com having a path of
ad_engagement
question mark and then I'll highlight
here click ID equals and then this long
seemingly random string but there's a
second HTTP parameter in this particular
URL amperand campaign ID equals 23. So
the campaign ID certainly with such a
small number is not meant to track you.
That's meant to be sufficient input to
the website to know what types of ads
should be served to you, what ad
campaign should be served up. But this
click ID, which is sort of a euphemism
for tracking cookie or tracking
parameter in this case, is what's
actually keeping track of you
specifically because different users are
going to find that whatever link they
click on has a slightly different value
for click ID. So recall that a tracking
cookie is something that's sent by an
HTTP header. And so it's harder for you
and me to see it unless we're more
comfortable with our browsers and can
poke around some underlying settings.
But these tracking parameters are right
there in front of you at least if you
click on the URL in your browser and
take a look at its entirety. Now
wonderfully at least for us end users
who are concerned about privacy browsers
and even thirdparty software are
increasingly removing values like this
for us. As soon as the browser
manufacturer or soon as the third party
software developer knows that wait a
minute click ID has no uh good purpose
other than tracking our users they can
simply automatically remove it for you.
After all, when you visit a web page and
you get the HTML that represents that
web page, the browser could certainly
poke around there before you even have a
chance to click on anything and it could
scrub or sanitize these kinds of
tracking parameters. Now, to be fair, if
the browser manufacturer doesn't
necessarily know what the tracking
parameter is called, or if maybe the
website is constantly changing the name
or trying to uh uh mix things up, this
might not work so well, but it's at
least an attempt to try to put downward
pressure on this very common technique
of keeping track of you and me. Now, why
is this parameter able to track us?
Well, this too can end up in those
server logs because this would be for
instance the web page that I am
requesting slash adden enggagement
question mark click ID equals dot dot
dot that could very well be logged by
the server stored in a database even and
they could use that information to know
exactly which pages I have clicked on
because I visited those links and even
what ads I have seen and maybe that's a
good thing commercially because now they
know what types of ads I'm clicking on
now they can serve even more of them to
me and that might be great for them but
probably not so great if not annoying or
invasive for me and you. So, something
else to keep a eye out for and something
else that might guide your
decision-making in the days and the
years to come when it comes to picking
your browser. You don't necessarily have
to nowadays use the one that comes with
your phone, comes with your laptop or
desktop. You can, if more comfortable,
install something else. And
increasingly, you and I are having more
and more options.
questions now on these tracking
parameters or anything prior with
respect to our privacy.
>> Are the cookies the ones that track or
are the ones that have been tracked?
>> The cookies are values that are being
used to track you. So recall that an a
metaphor for the cookies is like that
virtual handstamp. And so if all of
these web servers are putting ink on
your hand and on my hand, and because of
HTTP, you and I, our browsers are in the
habit of presenting these cookies, these
handstamps to every website we visit.
That value is being used to track us. So
cookies in and of themselves are just a
technology. It's a very simple idea.
Storing a big random value on your
computer and mine just to uniquely
identify us. They are necessary to give
us features like logging into websites,
maintaining shopping carts. But very
quickly, especially since the internet
from the get-go has been largely free to
use once you're or rather a lot of the
internet has been free to use once you
have a connection at least uh they've
been used or in some views abused by the
advertisers, the Facebooks and the
others of the world. So, another way to
think about tracking cookies is to
consider them to be third-party cookies.
Because indeed, even in the Google
example, that's how they're being used.
If a website like example.com is
embedding Google Analytics and therefore
some kind of HTML tag that mentions
google.com, well, then example.com is
the first party in that story, so to
speak, and google.com is the third party
in that story. What that means is that
your browser might get cookies from both
example.com and google.com. But the most
important ones presumably are the
firstparty ones from example.com because
that is the website you chose to go to
and whose functionality you want to use.
The third-party functionality like
tracking your clicks and your internet
behavior on that site via Google. That's
third-party. And so very commonly do
browsers nowadays certainly offer
options via which you can disable
third-party cookies. And that tends to
be good for privacy sake because it
means that you're blocking third parties
like Google from keeping track of you
via cookies. But but but that doesn't
necessarily mean the website isn't still
using tracking parameters in some way.
And you would only know that by actually
looking more closely at the URLs you're
clicking on or that are embedded in the
web page itself. And that's where now
browsers and thirdparty software are
additionally helping by helping us
remove not only those cookies but even
those parameters. But let's consider a
more concrete scenario of what
third-party cookies are and why they
allow companies not only like Google to
track your behavior on one website, but
even companies like Google or other
advertisers to track your behavior on
multiple websites. And in this sense,
third parties have increasingly been
more powerful, more omnisient, for
instance, than the firstparty websites
that you and I are actually visiting.
Why? Well, if there's a lot of popular
third parties out there, Google being
one of them for advertisements and for
analytics, well, if lots of different
websites are using them, maybe Harvard's
using them, Yale's using them,
Stanford's using them, then that third
party very quickly becomes more powerful
than even any of those individual
parties alone. Why? Because that third
party if it is being embedded in at
Harvard, Yale and Stanford, that third
party, Google for instance, kind of has
eyes into all three websites. And if it
sends the same cookie to you on all
three websites, Google might actually
know that you're poking around Harvard's
and Yale's and Stanford's website when
Harvard might have no idea you're
checking out Yale and Stanford. And
Stanford might have no idea you're
checking out Yale and Harvard. So, what
does this mean concretely? Well,
consider some HTML here such as we've
seen before and I've highlighted a
couple of salient characteristics in
this particular example. Notice that
I've given in this web page not only a
body which contains the body, the bulk
of the web page, I've also included a
head for the web page inside of which is
another tag called title. And I'm doing
this just to one demonstrate there are
more tags than we have seen in this
language thus far. And specifically,
this I claim is meant to represent
Harvard.edu's
own website. the title of which would be
Harvard like in the tab along the top of
the screen and inside of the body of
this page for simplicity let's assume
that for now there's just one big
advertisement there's no content in the
s for the sake of discussion there's
just one advertisement well where is
that advertisement coming from it's
coming from in this case example.com or
our friends at Google specifically a
file called ad.jif GIF and this
particular URL is being used as the
value of the source attribute of an
image tag. So what do I mean by this?
Well, if you visit harvard.edu in the
story, what you are seeing is a big
advertisement, a big gif, a graphic that
is coming from example.com.
Now, what is the implication of that?
Well, suppose that Yale is doing the
same thing. So here now, for the sake of
discussion is the exact same HTML except
it lives at yale.edu. So the title of
the page has now changed to Yale. And
moreover, just to make things really
interesting, let's add Stanford to the
mix. Same exact page. So the point of
this story is that Harvard and Yale and
Stanford are all using the same third
party, example.com in this in this case
or maybe someone like Google in the real
world and they're requesting moreover
the same GIF. And so the same file is
being accessed, but that even alone
isn't a strict requirement. the same
website is being accessed by all three
of these first parties. So what does
that mean? Suppose that you open up your
browser and you first visit harvard.edu.
Your browser is going to download the
HTML for Harvard's website. It's going
to see that oh, there's an image tag in
there and that image tag wants to show
this ad.jif from example.com. So your
browser is automatically by nature of
how browsers work going to send a second
HTTP request. This time requesting
add.jif GIF from the host example.com.
And just to tie today's stories
together, it's going to include probably
a referer HTTP uh uh header that
specifies where I'm coming from. And
that's useful for our purposes because
it puts these requests into context.
Now, that server, example.com or Google
in the case of the real world, is going
to probably respond with 200. Okay.
Like, okay, here is the advertisement.
And it's going to include not only the
image but also an HTTP header of its
own. And this is our old friend set
cookie where in this case for the sake
of discussion I'm going to propose that
it's setting a cookie on my computer
called ID because this is going to be my
unique identifier for example.com. Its
value is going to be the one I keep
using for discussion sake. 1 2 3 4 ABCD.
But that would be some big random value
for each of us. And my gosh, this
thing's going to last a year. That's the
number of seconds in 365 days. So this
cookie is being planted on my computer
by example.com because I visited
harvard.edu.
So Harvard is the first party,
example.com is the third party in this
case. But here now is the concern. When
I visit yale.edu with that same browser,
my hand has been stamped by example.com
already. And so what happens is that my
browser now presents that handstamp to
example.com sending the same ID and the
same value that is the same handstamp.
The host is as before example.com but
this time the referer happens to be
Yale. So in other words after I visited
Harvard and my hand has been stamped
with this tracking cookie this
third-party cookie from example.com my
browser when I visit yale.edu is going
to present that same handstamp again.
this time to example.com with this
referral. The next time I use my browser
to visit stanford.edu, the same message
is going to be sent from my browser to
example.com to request that same ad.
This time now from Stanford.edu's
website. Now, what's the implication?
Via these three HTTP requests,
example.com knows that I'm visiting
Stanford and before that Yale and before
that Harvard. And none of Harvard or
Yale or Stanford necessarily know that
I'm visiting any of those other
websites. The third party is the more
powerful. It's the more allseeing simply
because example.com or in the real world
Google is just so darn popular that it's
embedded in so many darn websites.
Google and others know almost everything
dare say about what you and I are doing
on the web because these ads are all
over the place in this way. So, we've
seen a very simple example, but it's
simple because cookies and HTTP really
are relatively. It's once you realize
how they work that you can use them not
only to solve compelling problems for
all of us, sessions and shopping carts
and the like, but also can be used to
monetize the internet and has been used
historically to monetize the internet or
even worse perhaps for us to track our
individual clicks and behavior. So, let
me pause here and see if there's any
questions now on thirdparty cookies and
why therefore it's perhaps so compelling
for you or me to opt into disabling them
or better yet to use browsers that are
starting to block them for us.
>> What browser are more secure among other
considering tracking parameters?
>> Sure. A quick tweak. I wouldn't say that
some browsers are more secure than
others in this context. I would say that
you want browsers that are more privacy
conscious or privacy preserving because
that's what we're talking about today.
Hopefully all of them are just as secure
when it comes to HTTPS and the
encryption that's just keeping our data
protected between points A and B. Um, so
generally Safari has been pretty good
when it comes to privacy and they are
the ones that very re recently that
you're using now um announced that
they're going to start giving people the
feature of removing tracking parameters
from URLs. In fact, the sample URL I
gave was actually from Apple's recent
announcement about exactly that.
DuckDuck Go is probably the most popular
thirdparty browser that is very privacy
conscious and tries to disable a lot of
these tracking behaviors. Another one is
Brave. Um, perhaps the worst offender is
probably Chrome, even though I myself am
guilty of using it myself because it's
so integrated into Google's ecosystem,
but Google of course has made their
business on monetizing your behavior and
mine. Um, so that is perhaps one to uh
put toward the bottom of the list if
you're concerned about this. Um, so
that's kind of how I would rank things.
And there's yet others, but I think
those are some of the most popular. And
then of course in the Microsoft
ecosystem there is Edge and Firefox too
has actually I should have put them
higher on the list. They are more
privacy conscious I do believe than
Google. So with all of these mechanisms
for tracking in mind what can we do to
protect all the more of our privacy.
Well you might already know of this
feature private browsing. So you don't
necessarily have to delete all of your
browser history and delete all of your
cookies. You can instead on occasion
open up a special type of window which
most of today's browsers support that
puts you into private mode or incognito
mode. And you can think of this as
giving you just a different chunk of
memory in the computer that doesn't know
any of your past browser history that
doesn't have any of your past cookies
that doesn't remember any of your past
usernames and passwords. You're starting
starting fresh so that everything you do
in that window is brand new. The catch
though is that everything you do in that
window still works exactly as the web
works as we have been describing. So
you're still might have tracking
parameters, you still might have
tracking cookies, you still might have
server logs, but when you close that
private window or you close that
incognito mode, at least the information
is discarded from your computer. So that
if tomorrow you do the exact same thing
and open up an incognito window again,
then it's as though you're starting
fresh with that server, except for the
reality, as per our past discussion,
that fingerprinting is still a
possibility. Your IP address can still
be factored in, as can be other
information that your browser might
still be leaking. But what you're not
doing is contaminating, so to speak,
your general browsing history with
specifically what you're using that
window for. What you should realize too
that private browsing or incognito mode
is entirely client side. So particularly
those logs that we've mentioned are
still being stored by the server. They
might be storing perhaps a different
tracking cookie or parameter for you
because it doesn't necessarily recognize
you when you're in private or incognito
mode. But it doesn't mean that your
tracks are completely absent from the
internet. rather it's really just
scrubbing them from your local computer
and decreasing the probability but not
eliminating the probability that a
server still knows that it's you. So I
would use with care. Um but with that
said if you take a course in web
development or you already design your
own websites using private browsing or
incognito mode can also be useful for
development purposes because it's a way
of opening a brand new window that has
no recollection of maybe past bugs that
you had or past web pages that you
clicked on. And it's very commonly used
as part of development tools to actually
facilitate and mimic the idea of
starting fresh with some site.
Super cookies though these sound
delicious but these two are kind of the
worst of cookies that we've discussed
already. We saw session cookies for
maintaining state. We saw tracking
cookies for tracking you. Super cookies
are not so super really. These are
cookies that are typically injected by a
third party like your company, your
university, or your internet service
provider into your HTTP requests. Which
is to say, if you from your browser
visit some website, that traffic of
course goes from your laptop or phone
through some internet service provider,
whether it's on campus or home or
wirelessly in the real world. And if
whoever is providing you with that
internet service can see the contents of
that virtual envelope, there's
technically nothing stopping them from
opening up the envelope, so to speak,
and adding one or more HTTP headers of
their own. And so mobile phone carriers
for instance in the past have been known
to do this whereby if you are just
requesting a website like example.com
from your phone they might halfway
between you and that server they might
inject a cookie of their own. For the
sake of discussion I'm going to use the
same name and value as before ID equals
1 2 3 4 abcd. But what's noteworthy here
is that that value is not coming from
your phone. It is not coming from your
browser. You can clear all of your
cookies. You can clear all of your
history. You can use incognito or
private mode on your phone. You're not
going to see any trace of that client
side because the darn thing is being
injected into your traffic between you
point A and the server point B. So, this
is sort of a canonical example of a
machineinthe-middle attack, but your
internet service provider in this
telling of the story is doing it because
they want to track you or they want
because of advertising relationships
they might have with some websites, they
want to make sure that you can be
tracked by that website even if you have
opted out or have been clearing
proactively your very own cookies. So,
suffice it to say, these have been
particularly controversial and
thankfully you and I do have a pretty
good defense here. Just never use HTTP
without encryption. If your URLs are
always HTTPS
slash and then something, theoretically,
this attack or this feature of your
mobile phone carrier should not be
possible. Why? Because if the contents
of the envelope are encrypted, not only
can't they see what's actually inside,
they can't add anything to the mix
because they don't have the key that's
being used to encrypt that information.
So simply using always HTTPS is one
solution to this problem. And also at
least in the US some of the mobile phone
carriers got a lot of backlash for this.
But so you can occasionally log into
your uh cell phone provers website, go
through a bunch of menus, find an option
to opt out of this feature, but I will
say from experience that they typically
bury these options too. And so it's not
necessarily even the easiest thing to
find. But again, this is just a natural
result of the underlying technology that
we're using being used or if you prefer
abused for alternative purposes. All
right, let me pause here and see if
there's any questions now on these super
cookies, which indeed are not so super
or anything prior. Given that cookies
store passwords and emails, can the
adversary um impersonate another person
by copying that cookie and uh pasting it
into its um his own computer and
visiting that website?
>> A good question. So cookies can be used
to store usernames, email addresses,
even passwords, though I would generally
not recommend doing this. But they
theoretically should be secure even if
you're storing those values in cookies
because they're going back and forth
between the browser and the server using
encryption if HTTPS is indeed in use. A
danger though is that if someone has
physical access to your computer, it's
very easy to poke around your own
browser's cookies, at which point
they're going to see your password,
which is probably not a good thing. So,
an alternative would be, for instance,
for a browser to encrypt the cookie or
minimally digitally sign it so that it
can be identified as belonging to that
same server. But even better, I dare
say, would be for servers to only plant
big random values as cookies on your
computer, like this virtual handstamp,
and then store recollection of your
username, email, and or password on the
server. So, stamp my hand to remember
who I am and that I'm logged in. But
don't bother expecting my browser to
send my username, my email address, my
password again and again. It should
suffice to send that just once. Other
questions here?
>> I've heard that it's possible uh for
example, if I'm writing a text to
someone, it's possible to intercept
alter my text and send it on my behalf.
So, it's going to be different message.
So, it's possible to ask maybe uh for a
sensitive information. So, I was
wondering, don't those uh messengers use
something like cookies? How can this be
possible?
>> A good question. So, SMS or traditional
texting is generally insecure. it is
very easy for someone to forge your
phone number and in fact if you've
gotten a lot of spam via text that might
be exactly what is happening. Um or
worse it's also possible recall to uh
steal your SIM card essentially or port
it to another carrier so that someone
can intercept all of your actual text.
So in general nowadays you should be
reducing if not eliminating your usage
of SMS at least for anything important
or anything you want to keep private.
When it comes to other messaging tools
like iMessage, like um WhatsApp, Signal,
Telegram, there's a lot of products
nowadays, thirdparty or otherwise, that
use end toend encryption, which recall
we discussed a couple of classes ago.
And in that case, even though the data
is going through a company like
Facebook, theoretically, assuming
they're behaving honorably and have
implemented end-to-end encryption
properly, then even they cannot see the
message going between their servers. And
that is independent of cookies. Cookies
have no uh part of that solution. That
solution is entirely thanks to
cryptography and encryption with digital
signatures.
All right, let's consider one other
threat to your privacy that you might
not necessarily have thought about that
doesn't relate just to the web, but
really your use of the internet more
generally. Namely, DNS, the domain name
system. Thankfully, even though
computers on the internet all have IP
addresses, these unique unique numeric
addresses that we've discussed, you and
I don't have to remember what servers IP
addresses are because servers typically
have domain name, something like
harvard.edu edu, yale.edu, Stanford.edu,
google.com, Amazon.com and others. But
how then when you type in any of those
domain names into your browser or into
any piece of software on the internet,
how does your browser or your computer
know what IP address to contact? Well,
it turns out that there's a domain name
system in the world. And this is a
system deployed throughout the world on
the internet whose purpose in life is to
translate domain names to IP addresses.
So that on the outside of those
envelopes can indeed go the IP addresses
of source and destination. But you and I
as humans don't need to know or remember
exactly what those IP addresses are. You
can think about this back in the day of
when we were in the habit of typing in
phone numbers to actual analog landline
telephones. It was actually pretty hard
to remember lots of people's numbers and
you might even had an address book that
you looked up people's numbers in. Or
there were certain pneummonics. For
instance, in the United States, there
was a number 1 800 collect C O L L E C
which was just much easier to remember
than the actual numbers for making a
collect call. The equivalent on the
internet is DNS which just automates
this process for us so that every
website, every service can have its own
unique name, but it's translated
automatically for us via DNS servers
throughout the world to the
corresponding IP address. But why is
this problematic? Well, it turns out
that DNS servers are typically in a few
different places. One, you probably have
one in your home or your company or your
university. And it probably is built
into, if in your home, the router, the
device that you're using just to connect
to the internet. But your internet
service provider also tends to have a
DNS server. And that DNS server probably
knows about way more IP addresses than
your own home does because why would
your own home network know about all of
the IP addresses in the world. But with
that said, why would your internet
service provider know about all of the
possible IP addresses and domain names
in the world? Well, suffice it to say,
for our purposes, there's a hierarchical
system. So even if your home router
doesn't know, even if your internet
service provider doesn't know, there's
some other server on the internet that
can eventually give you the answer to a
question like what is harvard.edu's IP
address, what is yale uh yale.edu's IP
address and so forth. And for
efficiency, once that answer has been
figured out somewhere, then your
internet service provider might remember
or cache the answer. and even your home
router and heck even your device or your
browser might remember the same answer
for efficiency. So we don't have to keep
asking the same question. And it turns
out by convention DNS uses port 53. If
you recall our discussion of also using
unique numbers to identify things like
HTTP or 80 or HTTPS or 443 or 22 for
SSH, DNS tends to use 53. But the catch
is that the traffic used for DNS is
typically unencrypted. Which means that
when your phone or your laptop or your
desktop is asking your home device or
maybe your internet service provider or
someone else, what is the IP address for
harbor.edu or yale.edu or the like.
You're actually announcing to the world
what website you are about to visit.
Why? Because you're waiting for a
response from the DNS server to actually
tell you the corresponding IP address.
So, this isn't great. And moreover, your
internet service provider therefore
knows all of this information about you
because every time you ask for a new
website that you've never been to
before, your home network probably
doesn't know the IP address. So, you
have to ask your internet service
provider. And again, they might ask
someone else, but the internet service
provider is going to know now that you
asked. So, your internet service
provider, be it for your home network or
for your cellular phone, pretty much
knows every website you've ever been to,
assuming they're logging this
information, which they probably are,
unless there are regulatory or legal
requirements that say they can't or they
can't for very long. Now, why is this
the case? Well, the domain name system
essentially requires that we ask these
very questions. And if the internet
service providers remember these
answers, well, they can keep track of
everywhere we've been, at least at a
high level. DNS only gives them back a
translation from the domain name to the
IP address. What it does not include is
the specific page that you're looking
at, the specific URL, the folder, the
file that you're looking at. So, your
internet service provider might know
you're visiting somewhere on harvard.edu
edu cuz you asked of course for its IP
address, but they don't know what
department you were looking for or what
course you were looking at or the like.
But there's still a decent amount of
invasion therefore of your privacy if
you'd rather that ISP or someone else
just not know that information. So
increasingly there are alternatives to
the standard DNS functionality. One of
which is called DNS over HTTPS or DO for
short. This means exactly that. Instead
of just sending out DNS requests
unencrypted on port 53 to the local DNS
server, now they're sent potentially if
you enable this over HTTPS.
And what this means is that they will be
sent using the HTTP protocol which we've
talked about endlessly in these virtual
envelopes, but securely using TLS, which
is the encryption protocol that ensures
that no one else can see what's going on
inside of that envelope, including your
internet service provider. Now, someone
is going to still know what domain name
you're looking up because after all, to
whom are you sending this request? Maybe
you're sending it to Google. Maybe
you're sending it to some third party,
but you are sending it to someone. But
at least goes the thinking, it's not
your internet service provider who
really doesn't need to know this
information. So, that's one way of
thinking about it. And there's
alternatives to this. There's actually
something called DNS over TLS, DOT,
which is very similar in Spirit, but it
doesn't even bother using HTTP, but it
is still using encryption. So, this is
something that's increasingly common.
It's not necessarily the default on a
lot of systems, but it's yet another
feature of today's technology that you
can increasingly look for, seek out,
enable proactively if this too is a
concern that you don't necessarily want
a third party like your ISP to know what
it is you're accessing. And it might not
even be your own ISP. If you're on the
road and in a a coffee shop that gives
Wi-Fi or an airport that gives Wi-Fi, at
that point, your internet service
provider is effectively that coffee shop
or that airport. And do you really want
them knowing everywhere you're going?
You might be, depending on your comfort
level, prefer you might be preferring
that at least all of your HT all of your
DNS requests go to some other central
party that you do trust for whatever
reason. So you're not just informing
every different Wi-Fi hotspot that you
might be using around the world. Let me
pause here and see if there's any
questions now about DNS
and this concern with respect to your
privacy or these solutions there too.
>> Can DNS spoofing used to deceive users
and steals like information which is
sensitive?
>> Absolutely. So DNS itself can also be
used for evil purposes. If you control
the DNS server, you don't have to give
an honest answer. If you as someone asks
you for the IP address of harvard.edu,
you could give them the IP address of
some completely malicious server that
you control. However, if the user, like
Ryan in this case, is using HTTPS,
the whole point of HTTPS is to encrypt
the data between browser and server, and
presumably the browser is going to try
to request the uh TLS certificate of
harvard.edu in this case. But if the IP
address returns the wrong certificate
that wasn't signed by the right website,
then the connection might fail and
you'll be given a warning that you can
typically ignore in your browser, but
this should be preventable because you
should at least be warned that that is
not working correctly. And ISPs actually
do this quite often. If you make a
typographical error sometimes on home
networks or coffee shops or airports,
you might actually still see a website
of like search results or worse
advertisements. And that's because even
if you made a typo in the domain name,
the coffee shops or the airport's DNS
server is still going to return to you
an IP address of their server so they
can at least push some content at you.
So let's consider some of the mechanisms
via which we can push back on some of
these more invasive privacy practices.
And one is something we've talked about
before, namely a virtual private network
or VPN, which is a increasingly familiar
technology, but it's worth knowing
exactly what problems it is solving for
you and exactly which problems it is
not. Particularly if you're using such a
service to protect your own privacy.
Well, what is a VPN? It allows us,
recall, to connect from point A to
another point B using an completely
encrypted tunnel. So it doesn't matter
if there are machines in the middle as
indeed there will be on the internet.
All of the traffic between A and B on a
VPN is encrypted or scrambled. So what
does this do? This allows you to access
sometimes a corporate network or a
university network that might have
servers or services that are only
accessible if you are on physically or
if you are on virtually that particular
network. This ensures that even if
you're at home or in a cafe or an
airport, at least you have an encrypted
more secure connection to the campus or
the corporate network, at which point
the campus or company might be more
comfortable with you accessing those
services. Now, this does not prevent you
still from being hacked because if
you're running uh malware on your own
computer accidentally, doesn't matter if
you have an encrypted connection to the
company or campus, you might very well
have an infected connection now to the
company or campus. if you yourselves are
infected. But VPNs can also be used to
create the illusion that you're actually
in one country and not another. Why?
Well, if point A is where you are and
point B is somewhere in abroad, well to
the rest of the world, if you start
using this VPN, this virtual private
network, you will appear to have an IP
address is that is in that foreign
country because all of your internet
traffic for chatting, video
conferencing, the web will be sent
through that VPN by design. That's what
a VPN is for. and it will come out the
other end in that foreign country and
then continue on its way to the chat
service, the email service, the uh the
web service or the like. So each of
those services will think that you live
or are physically in that foreign
country even if you are not actually. So
what's the implication of this? A
virtual private network only guarantees
that the connection between you and that
point B is encrypted. It doesn't
necessarily mean that once you're out of
that VPN, it's going to stay encrypted,
especially if you're using still HTTP
and not HTTPS, but it does at least
encrypt everything between points A and
B. It also does change what your IP
address appears to be so that you will
indeed appear to have an IP address
that's from that foreign country and not
your domestic IP address, which might
have some value in covering your tracks
or decreasing the probability that
you'll be identified. But again, we've
seen so many other mechanisms today
whereby your browser can be
fingerprinted in the context of the web
that someone might still be able to
realize that okay, your IP is a
different today, but this still looks
like you even if they don't necessarily
know that you are David Men or or you
yourself, but it at least does solve at
least one problem, which is encrypting
end to end all of your traffic. Well,
there's another piece of software that's
been popular for some time called to the
onion router. So, this is a piece of
software that you can install on your
own Mac or PC or other device. And this
uses encryption to solve the problem a
different way using additional
encryption to try to give you a higher
probability of privacy. And here's a
picture that tour themselves puts on
their website and it has depicting here
you on a very old school PC connecting
to a whole bunch of nodes inside of this
tour network connected to ultimately
maybe the websites that you're visiting.
And what happens here is that when your
computer is running the tour software,
the tour software first figures out,
okay, who else in the world is using the
tour software? because it's going to use
those other computers to route your
traffic up, down, left, and right. And
kind of like the movies or TV where you
see a a a map of the world and the the
traffic is bouncing back and forth and
back and forth. That's kind of the
spirit of tour. And what happens is if
your computer here wants to send uh a
request to a website that's maybe over
here and it decides for instance to
route it through one 2 three computers.
What the tour software will do is
encrypt the request at least three
different times. Whatever web request
you are sending, whatever email you are
sending, whatever chat message you're
sending, whatever service you are using
between point A on the left and point B
on the right is going to be encrypted
with this node's public key with this
node's public key with this node's
public key. And so here's the onion in
to the onion router. You are encrypting
layer upon layer upon layer of data. So
that mathematically recall per our
discussion of public key cryptography
only this node can peel off one layer
only this node can peel off one layer
only this node can peel off one layer
using their own respective private keys
which undo the effect of your having
encrypted your traffic. So what you're
really doing here by choosing perhaps a
different path every request, a
different path every day is you are with
tour effectively covering your tracks in
some sense. And by design, the tour
software doesn't remember much
information at all. So it doesn't have
the sorts of logs that I propose can be
worrisome, at least in the context of
web servers. By design, tour is meant to
preserve your privacy with higher
probability. And so by design, it just
doesn't keep nearly as much information
around. Now, this isn't to say that if
you're doing this for malicious
purposes, trying to evade the
authorities, this isn't to say that this
computer, this computer, this computer
couldn't be subpoenaed, so to speak, by
some government entity, and they could
reconstruct the path that your data
took. But the point is that it's
generally quite laborious. By this time,
all of that data has disappeared from
those interior nodes, and so they don't
have much information to share. And so
increasingly it does provide you with
some higher probability of privacy by
layering your requests with encryption
encryption encryption and sort of
trusting that these interior nodes are
going to relay it to the final endpoint.
So something to consider if of interest
but realize too that because of how the
internet works with IP addresses because
of how the internet works with port
numbers it's still possible on a network
to know who is using tour for instance.
So if you happen to be the only person
at home, the only person on a company or
on a university network who's using tour
at the moment, it's being used for
malicious purposes, odds are you could
be targeted as the source of that
attack. And so realize in particular
that this just raises the bar to
detection. It raises the bar to your
privacy being invaded, but it does not,
as does none of the techn as do none of
the technologies we've discussed, give
you an absolute protection of these same
properties.
So there's one final mechanism when it
comes to preserving one's privacy that's
thankfully increasingly available to us
on devices on desktops and laptops and
especially on phones and that's this
notion of permissions which isn't
anything new but as iOS and Android and
other operating systems have evolved
increasingly you and I are being asked
by our operating systems do you want to
allow this not only do you want to allow
this program to run but do you want to
allow this program to access your camera
for instance, do you want this program
to access your microphone for instance?
Do you want this uh application to
access your contacts for instance? So on
the one hand we're being given much more
fine grained control which is a good
thing presumably. At the same time it's
also just pushing the decision on to you
and me. And very often with these
applications, as you've probably found,
well, if you don't enable the camera and
give access to the app, it just might
not work because they have some code in
their application that says if camera is
not on, then do not do anything useful.
So there's this tension between
usability and privacy in this case, but
thankfully there's finer grain controls
too. On iOS, for instance, you might be
prompted, do you want to give this app
access to this feature always or only
while using the application or never?
And that's certainly a good thing for
something like the camera or the
microphone where it would be nice to
trust that when you close the app and
put your phone in your pocket that it's
not still listening to or trying to
watch you from this built-in hardware.
Now, there is some feature that might
need to run all of the time, which
includes location-based services, which
is to say that our phones, especially
nowadays, can pretty effectively track
our location using GPS or Wi-Fi or some
other technology. Now, that's of course
useful if not necessary for using
mapping applications like maps or Google
Maps or the like that help us get
physically from point A to point B. But
very commonly, these applications, at
least by default, ask for access to your
geographic location always. Which means
just by walking down the street, even if
you're not following a map on your
phone, means that the app can still be
tracking where you're going. And
certainly among the Googles and the
Apples of the world nowadays or other
manufacturers, they certainly know
pretty much everywhere you and I are
going if we leave these location-based
services on by default. So this is an
example of something of which which of
which you should be mindful if only
because here is yet another example of
information that logically when you
think about it okay obviously that makes
sense they must be keeping track of my
like my location otherwise how could
they provide me with mapping services
but pause and think now perhaps exactly
what the implications are for you for
your privacy and just walking around
24/7 with these radios now in our
pockets
So even though there are quite a few
threats to our privacy online
especially, at least there are these
mechanisms that you and I can enable to
at least preserve some of the same.
Well, what have we done over the past
few weeks? We began with a look at how
we can secure our accounts, then our
data, then our systems, then our
software. And today, of course, focusing
on preserving our privacy. And by way of
the various technologies we've looked
at, the stories we've told, the
principles that we've introduced, we
hope that in the days, the weeks, and
the years to come, you can use all of
these first principles and these ideas
and these building blocks to extrapolate
to how new technologies work, to how new
threats might affect you, and to what
questions you should be asking of either
the software you use or the software you
develop to ensure that not only your
communications are secure, but also that
it has these privacy preserving
properties that you and your users and
your customers might want. This then was
CS50's introduction to cyber security
and this was CS50."

course. This course is perfect for
anyone who wants to learn about
Kubernetes, but it's designed for people
who want to take the certified
Kubernetes administrator or CKA
examination. My name is Bo KS and I'm
teaching this course. This course is
designed to provide a deep practical
understanding of Kubernetes
administration from foundational
concepts to advanced troubleshooting.
I'll give detailed explanations and
hands-on demonstrations for every topic
in the official CKA curriculum.
Kubernetes is an open-source container
orchestration platform that automates
the deployment, scaling, and management
of containerized applications.
In modern software development,
applications are often packaged into
lightweight portable units called
containers. While running a single
container is straightforward, managing
hundreds or thousands of them across a
fleet of machines presents significant
challenges. Kubernetes addresses these
challenges by providing a robust
framework for running distributed
systems resiliently. The core benefits
of Kubernetes include self-healing which
automatically restarts failed containers
and reschedules them on healthy nodes.
It also offers automatic scaling
allowing applications to scale up or
down based on resource usage. And
finally, it facilitates zero downtime
deployments, which is essential for
rolling out updates without interrupting
service. Mastery of Kubernetes is a
critical skill for DevOps engineers,
cloud administrators, and software
developers involved in deploying and
maintaining modern cloudnative
applications. The certified Kubernetes
administrator or CKA program was created
by the cloudnative computing foundation
and the Linux foundation to validate the
skills required to perform the
responsibilities of a Kubernetes
administrator. And the Linux Foundation
provided a grant to make this course
possible. The CKA exam is a rigorous
online proctored performance-based test
that requires solving multiple hands-on
tasks from a command line interface
within a 2-hour time limit. The exam
curriculum is divided into several
domains, each with a specific waiting as
of the latest curriculum update. These
are troubleshooting at 30%. Cluster
architecture installation and
configuration at 25%,
services and networking at 20%,
workloads and scheduling at 15%.
And storage at 10%. The significant
weight given to troubleshooting and
cluster installation underscores the
exam's focus on practical realorld
administration skills. During the exam,
candidates have access to the official
Kubernetes documentation, making it a
test of knowledge, application, and
problem solving speed rather than wrote
memorization.
The fundamental principle underpinning
Kubernetes is its declarative model.
Instead of issuing a series of
imperative commands like run this
container or stop that one, an
administrator defines the desired state
of the system in YAML manifest files.
These files describe what applications
should be running, how many replicas
they should have, what network policies
should be enforced, and so on. Once
these manifests are applied to the
cluster, Kubernetes controllers work
continuously in a control loop to
observe the actual state of the cluster
and make changes to reconcile it with
the desired state. If a pod crashes, a
controller notices the discrepancy
between the desired replica count and
the actual count and creates a new one.
This model is the foundation of
Kubernetes self-healing and automation
capabilities. A successful CKA must
think declaratively and be proficient in
reading, writing, and modifying these
YAML manifests.
Before diving into advanced
administrative tasks, a solid
understanding of the Kubernetes
architecture and its core components is
important. This section covers the
conceptual framework of a Kubernetes
cluster and provides a step-by-step
guide to setting up a local practice
environment that mirrors the tools and
configurations you will encounter in the
CKA exam. A Kubernetes cluster follows a
master slave or more accurately a
control plane worker node architecture.
The control plane acts as the brain
making global decisions and managing the
cluster state while the worker nodes are
the muscle running the actual
application workloads. The control plane
is the set of components responsible for
container orchestration and maintaining
the desired state of the cluster. It can
run on a single machine or be replicated
across multiple machines for high
availability. The cube API server is the
central hub and the front end of the
control plane. All communication to and
from the cluster goes through the API
server. It exposes a Kubernetes API,
validates and processes all API requests
and coordinates all processes between
control plane and worker node
components. ETCD is the cluster's single
source of truth. It's a consistent and
highly available distributed key value
store where all cluster data, its
configuration, state, and metadata is
stored. For security and consistency,
direct access to ECTD is restricted. All
interactions must go through the cube
API server. The cube scheduler acts as
the cluster's matchmaker. It watches for
newly created pods that do not yet have
a node assigned. For every such pod, the
scheduler finds the best node for it to
run on based on a complex set of
factors, including resource
requirements, hardware constraints,
affinity and anti-affffinity rules, and
data locality. The cube controller
manager is the autopilot of the cluster.
It runs various controller processes in
the background. Each controller is a
control loop that watches the shared
state of the cluster through the cube
API server and works to move the current
state towards the desired state.
Examples include the node controller
which handles node failures and the
replication controller which maintains
the correct number of pods. Worker nodes
are the machines where your applications
run. They are managed by the control
plane and contain all the necessary
services to run containers. The cublet
is the primary node agent that runs on
each worker node. It communicates with
the cube API server to receive
instructions and report the status of
the node and its containers. Its main
job is to ensure that the containers
described in pod specifications are
running and healthy. It manages the
entire life cycle of the containers on
its node. Qroxy is a network proxy that
runs on each node and is a fundamental
part of the Kubernetes service concept.
It maintains network rules on the node
which allow for network communication to
your pods from both inside and outside
the cluster. It can use various modes to
direct traffic destined for a services
virtual IP to the correct backend pod.
Finally, the container runtime is the
software responsible for running the
containers. Kubernetes supports several
container runtimes such as containered
and CRIO. The cublet communicates with
the container runtime using the
container runtime interface or CRI. To
manage container operations like pulling
images and starting and stopping
containers, Kubernetes objects are
persistent entities in the Kubernetes
system. By creating an object, you are
telling the Kubernetes system what you
want your cluster's workload to look
like. This is your your cluster's
desired state. Pods are the smallest and
most fundamental deployable unit in
Kubernetes. They represent a single
instance of a running process in your
cluster. A pod encapsulates one or more
tightly coupled containers which share
storage resources, a unique network IP,
and options that govern how the
container should run. While a pod can
contain multiple containers, the most
common pattern is one container per pod.
Replica sets and deployments. A replica
sets purpose is to maintain a stable set
of replica pods running at any given
time. It guarantees the availability of
a spec of specified number of identical
pods. A deployment is a high a higher
level object that manages replica sets
and provides declarative updates to
pods. You describe a desired state in a
deployment and the deployment controller
changes the actual state to the desired
state at a controlled rate. Deployments
are the standard and recommended way to
manage stateless applications in
Kubernetes services. Since pods are
ephemeral and their IP addresses can
change, a service provides a stable
endpoint to access a logical set of
pods. A service acts as an abstraction
defining a policy by which to access the
pods and provides a stable virtual IP
address or the cluster IP and a DNS
name. Any traffic sent to the service is
automatically load balanced to the
appropriate backend pods. Name spaces
provide a mechanism for isolating groups
of resources within a single cluster.
They are a way to divide cluster
resources between multiple users or
teams. The names of resources need to be
unique within a namespace but not across
name spaces. This allows different teams
to use the same resource names without
conflict. The CKA exam is entirely
hands-on, making practical experience
the most important component of
preparation. This section details how to
create a local Kubernetes cluster using
Cube ADM, the same tool used to
bootstrap production clusters. This
approach provides deep insight into the
cluster's inner workings, which is
invaluable for both the exam and real
world administration.
Managed Kubernetes services like GKE or
EKS abstract away many of these
foundational layers, but the CKA
certification validates your ability to
build and maintain a cluster from the
ground up on generic Linux machines.
Understanding why each setup step is
necessary is as important as knowing the
commands themselves. Before installing
Kubernetes, each machine or VM intended
to be a node in the cluster must meet
certain requirements. A compatible Linux
host, for example, Ubuntu 22.04 or Cynth
OS7, at least 2 GB of RAM per machine,
at least at least two CPUs for the
control plane node, and full network
connectivity between all machines. So,
our first step is to install a container
runtime. Kubernetes requires a container
runtime on each node to manage
containers. While Docker was
historically popular, the CKA exam
environment and modern clusters
typically use runtimes that directly
implement the CRI such as containered or
CIO. We'll install containered. So these
commands I'm about to show you must be
run on all nodes uh control plane and
workers. So first we're going to load
required kernel modules. Kubernetes
networking required relies on the
colonel's ability to see bridge traffic.
So we have cat eo f pseudo t etc
modules-loadad
dcads.
Overlay brnet filter and eof. So these
commands basically serve two main
purposes persistence and immediate
activation.
So first we create a new configuration
file. That's this right here. And the
content of the file simply lists the two
modules the overlay and BR net filter.
So these files in the this uh directory
are read by the system during boot. Any
module listed in these files will be
automatically loaded into the kernel
every time the system starts. And here's
the activation. And we're going to use
pseudo mod pro overlay and then pseudo
mod pro bret filter to activate those
right now. Then we don't have to reboot
anything. So kubernetes components can
start immediately and find the
networking features they need. And just
so you kind of understand them o
overlay. This is the preferred storage
driver used by modern container runtimes
like containered to build and manage
container images. Overlay FS allows a
container to use a readonly base image
layer and a writable layer on top making
container startup fast and efficient in
terms of disk space. And then the BR net
filter, it's a module that enables the
kernel to correctly process network
packets coming from aworked bridge.
Okay. Next, we'll configure CIS control
for networking. These next settings
ensure that IP tables correctly
processes processes bridge traffic which
is important for cube proxy and the CNI
plugin. So just like before we're
creating this configuration file and we
are putting these custom kernel
settings. So
basically these will be configured every
time we start the system and then we'll
just do this pseudo ciscontroller system
to immediately activate the commands. So
and like I said these are these
parameters are critical for how
Kubernetes internal networking managed
by qroxy and the CNI plugin handles data
packets. Now we can finally install
containered. So first we'll update
pseudo app to do pseudoapp get update
and then we just do pseudo app get
installed containered. Okay. And let me
clear that out again. So now we're going
to configure containered. We'll generate
the default configuration file and
modify it to use the system croup
driver. The cublet and the container
runtime must use the same croup driver
to properly manage resource limits.
Mismatches here are a common source of
cluster instability.
So first we will make a directory and
then we have pseudo containered config
default pipe pseudo tetc containered
config.tl TML and this and then this
line at the bottom pseudo set- I system
Cgroup equals false system croup equals
true and we have etc/ontainer config
tunnels. So basically finishing updating
the configuration like I was saying
before and then we'll clear out the
screen. Now we just have to restart and
enable containered. So, pseudo system
controller restart containered and then
pseudo systemcontroller
enable containered. Okay. Next, we're
going to install the Kubernetes
binaries. We'll install cube admlet and
cube controller on all nodes. These are
basically essential kubernetes tools and
ensure the operating system is
configured and correctly for stable
operation. So, let's disable swap. The
cublet requires swap to be disabled to
ensure predictable resource management
and performance. So pseudo swap off- a
and this line is basically to make this
persistent across reboots. We comment
out the swap line in slashct
stab. Okay. Now let's add the kubernetes
apt repository pseudo app get install.
That's why apt transport https
certificates curl gpg. Now this
directory we just have to make if it
doesn't already exist to prepare for our
next command. And this is going to
download the kubernetes signin key and
registers it with a. So we're adding
this so appgget knows where to look for
cube cube adm and cube controller. And
we'll do pseudoapp get update to make
sure we update the package lists. Now
we'll do pseudo app get install cublet
cubadm and cube controller what we'll
need for this tutorial. And which
service should be restarted? We'll just
do none for now. And then we'll do this
a mark hold which is going to prevent
accidental upgrades which is important
an important practice for maintaining a
stable cluster vision cluster version.
Okay. Next we're going to configure a
single node cluster. So for initial
practice a single node cluster is
sufficient. This involves initializing
the machine as a control plane and then
removing a taint that prevents user
workloads from running on it. So we have
this command pseudo cubadm init pod
network cider and then 10.244.0.016.
The pod network cider flag specifies the
AP address range for the pod network.
This is required by most CNI plugins. So
next we are going to configure cube
controller. So we'll first make the
directory. Then we copy the cluster
administrator configuration file created
by cube adm to the standard location.
And then this uh next command changes
the file ownership. So the current
nonroot user can securely interact with
the cluster using the cube controller
tool. So the result the user can now run
cube controller commands to manage the
cluster without needing pseudo. Okay.
Now I've just run this command to remove
the control plane taint. By default, the
control plane node is tainted uh to
prevent regular application pods from
running scheduled from being scheduled
on it. But for a single node cluster,
the taint must be removed. And now it
is. And now for this next command, we're
going to install a CNI plugin. The
cluster is not fully functional until a
container network interface or CNI
plugin is installed. Without it, pods
cannot communicate with each other and
core DNS will not start correctly. We'll
use flannel for this single node setup.
And now we can verify the cluster. We
can check that the node is in the ready
state and that all system pods in the
cube system name space are running. So
we'll do cube controller get nodes and
we can see that one's ready. And then
cube controller get pods- cube systems.
And we can see the pods are running.
Okay, we now have a functional single
node Kubernetes cluster ready for the
other things we'll be doing with
Kubernetes in this course.
This section covers the core
competencies of a Kubernetes
administrator.
Building, managing, and securing a
multi-node cluster. The tasks detailed
here are fundamental to the CKA exam and
represent a significant portion of its
total score. We'll expand upon the
single node setup to construct a
production style multi-node cluster,
manage its life cycle through upgrades
and backups, implement high
availability, and configure access
control and application management
tooling. Building a multi-node cluster
involves a coordinated setup process
across all machines. The following steps
assume you have at least two nodes, one
designated as the control plane and one
as a worker. The prerequisite steps from
part one must be completed on every node
that will be part of the cluster. This
includes ensuring unique host names, MAC
addresses, and product UU IDs. disabling
swap memory, configuring required kernel
modules and CIS control settings,
installing a container runtime and
ensuring its croup driver is set to
systemd and finally installing the
Kubernetes binaries cubeadm cublet and
cube control and placing them on hold.
The following steps I'm going to go over
assumes that you have two machines
running or two virtual machines. So, one
should be designated the control plane.
That's this one right here. And the
other is uh designated a worker. So the
one with the white background is the
worker.
Now I have two VMs running on my Mac OS
using UTM. Now you can follow along in
other ways as well, but there were some
extra settings I had to do to make sure
that they each have a different IP
address. when I did not have the VMs
running, there were some settings in
UTM. And just in case you're going to
use UTM or something like that, um, so
this is UTM. And to make sure they do
not have the same IP address, I had to
um, stop the VMs. I'm not going to do
that right now, but you can go into edit
and then you can go into network
preferences and then you can uh, change
the MAC address of one of them. They
have to have different MAC addresses.
And then also I had to change the
network mode to bridged. So basically I
had to go to the settings the network
tab and then change the network mode
from shared network to bridged. And then
I had to restart the virtual machines.
And so the prerequisite steps that we
already showed where we installed
everything must be completed on every
machine that will be part of the
cluster. So I've already configured both
these machines. the control plane and
the worker the in the same way as I saw
as we saw the setup earlier. So now
let's continue setting up the control
plane Linux or the virtual machine. This
one is the one that's going to manage
the cluster. So let's start by
removing the old cluster configuration.
We're going to tear down the existing CL
cluster that we made before because we
are going to now create it within a
using a slightly different method.
Now we have to get the IP address. This
is something we didn't do when we
created the cluster earlier. And then we
use the pod network cider. This IP range
is required by most network plugins
CNIs.
And for Calico, this is the common
default. And then we need to use the
private IP address of this control plane
VM. Other nodes will use this address to
communicate with it. So I'm just going
to copy the IP address and we'll paste
it at the end here. Okay. And that
worked. If you get an error, it's
possible you need to turn the swap off
again with pseudo swap off- a. Now, we
did that earlier, but sometimes if you
restart your machine or something like
that, it may not be off anymore. That's
one thing you have to look out for.
Okay. Well, the output of this command
is important. It provides a cube adm
join command containing a token and a
discovery token CA certificate hash.
So we need to copy this entire command
and save it. We'll need it to connect
the worker node. Next, we're going to
install a container network interface or
CNI plugin. So we're still on the
control plane node, the virtual machine.
So immediately after initialization, our
control plane node will have a not ready
status because it lacks a network
plugin. The cluster will not be
functional until a CNI is installed. So
let's install Calico. Calico is a
popular CNI that provides both
networking and network policy
enforcement. The CKA exam often involves
tasks related to network policies which
makes Calico an excellent choice for a
practice environment. So we'll just do
cubecontroller apply-f and then we have
this URL here for Calico. Okay, so we
got that installed and now we just want
to verify the CNI installation. After a
few moments, the calico pod should be
running in the cube system namespace and
the control plane node status should
change to ready. So we'll just run these
two commands. CubeController get
pods-cube system and cubecontroller get
nodes
and we can see from the output that the
pods are running and the status is
ready.
Okay, now we need to join the worker
node to the cluster. So we need to be on
the worker virtual machine. Remember the
one with the the white background. So
we're on the worker virtual machine and
we're going to connect it to the
cluster. We're going to run the cube adm
join command. So we need to paste in the
command or use the same command that we
saved from the control plane and
initialization step. And this command
must be run with root privileges. Okay,
we got that working. So, let's go back
to the control plane virtual machine and
we're going to verify verify the cluster
from the control plane. So, we'll return
to the control plane and we just want to
make sure everything is successfully
joined. So, I'm going to use
cubecontroller get nodes- o wide. The o
wide flag provides additional
information including the internal IP of
each node. And now we can see both
nodes, the the control plane and then
the worker node. So we now have a fully
functional production style multi-node
Kubernetes cluster. A key responsibility
of a Kubernetes administrator is
managing the cluster's life cycle which
includes performing version upgrades and
ensuring the cluster's state can be
recovered in case of a disaster. Cube
ADM provides a structured workflow for
upgrading a Kubernetes cluster. The
process must be done carefully upgrading
the control plane first followed by the
worker nodes one at a time to ensure
workload availability. So let's upgrade
the control plane. U so we'll run three
commands. One to the app mark uphold
unhold cube QD cube adm to up unhold the
package. Then we'll install the target
version
and then we will hold it again.
Now in this case um some of these
upgrades could also be downgrades. Um
you can use the same process whether
you're upgrading or downgrading to
another different version. And then we
want to check for upgrade compatibility
and view the target versions with um
plan pseudo cube admgrade plan.
Okay. Now we want to apply the upgrade
with cubeadm upgrade apply and then the
version. This command upgrades the
static pod manifest for the control
plane components like cube API server
etc etc.
Now let's upgrade cublet and cube
controller.
So we basically want to upgrade the
other binaries on the same node. Uh
again we'll unhold cubelet and cube
controller. Then we'll install the new
versions.
Then we will hold them again. Hold
cublet and cube controller again.
Now we want to restart the cublet. So we
just use a pseudo system controller
diamond damon reload and pseudo system
controller restart cublet.
Now we have to upgrade the worker nodes.
Uh in this case I just have one but
you'll want to repeat this process for
each worker node individually. The first
step in upgrading the worker nodes is
actually on the control plane node. So
first we need to safely evict all
workloads from the worker node we are
about to upgrade. So we're going to run
this um the cube controller drain and
then we get the node. We have the node
name from up there and ignore damon
sets. Okay. Now we go over to the worker
node and you can either go to it
directly like I'm doing or we can ssh
into it and we upgrade the binaries just
like we did before. So unhold cube adm
and cublet.
Then we can do app get update app get
install and then the the different the
updated versions of cubeadm and cublet.
And then we just have to hold them
again. hold cube adm and cublet. Now we
need to upgrade the node configuration
with cubadm upgrade node which is a
command that updates the local cublet
configuration for the worker node and
then restart the cublet. So system
control controller damon reload and
system controller restart cublet. Then
on the control plane virtual machine, we
want to mark the worker node as
schedulable again allowing the pods to
be placed on it with uncordon cube
controller uncordin
with the node to upgrade.
Now let's talk about backing up and
restoring
etc.
So on the control plane virtual machine
uh since ECCD stores the entire state of
the cluster having a reliable backup is
very important. These operations use the
etc DCTL or the etc controller command
line tool. So we need to perform a
backup. So on the cubeadm cluster the
etc server runs as a static pod. This
command here connects it to connects to
it using the required TLS certificates
to create a snapshot. DB file. If you
get any errors, um you do also have to
make sure that there's no swap. You may
have to run the pseudo swap off- a again
to get these commands to work. Okay. Now
we can perform a restore. This is a
destructive operation that replaces the
cluster state. So, first we stop the
cublet to prevent interference with
system controller stop cublet. Then we
restore the snapshot to a new directory
with this command. And then we're going
to have to manually edit the etc static
pod manifest
and then update its volume mount to
point to the new data directory.
So um to update it we'll use uh nano. So
we need to install nano and then we can
use nano to edit the the manifest for
etc.
And inside editor we need to find the
volume definition for the etc data
directory. We'll use the arrow keys to
scroll down to find the volume section.
uh under the the that volume find the
host path key and change its path to
varlibetcdrestored.
We need to add- restored. So then we
just need to save and exit nano control
X. The final step is to restart the
cublet to start the etc pod with the
restored data with system controller
start cublet. The cublet will detect the
change of the manifest and restart the
etc pod using the restored data. The
rest of the control plane components
will then restart and reconcile their
state based on the restored etc data.
A single control plane node represents a
single point of failure for for
production environments. A highly
available or HA control plane with
multiple replicated control plane nodes
is essential. Cube ADM supports two HA
topologies stacked control plane and
external ETCD. The stack topology where
ETCD members are coll-located on the
control plane nodes is simpler to set up
and common in CKA scenarios. An HA setup
requires a stable endpoint for all nodes
to communicate with the API server. This
is typically achieved with an external
load balancer. First, provision a load
balancer that sits in front of your
control plane nodes. Then, configure the
load balancer to forward TCP traffic on
a specific port to the same port on the
private IP addresses of all your control
plane nodes. Finally, the load balancer
should perform a TCP health check on
port 6443 to ensure it only routes
traffic to healthy cube API server
instances. Okay, I have an external load
balancer running at this IP address.
Just another one on my local network
here. So on the control plane node,
we're just going to run this cube ADM
init with the control plane endpoint.
Like I said, this is the load paler's IP
address and the port. And then we' use
the update upload search flag which is
critical for security for securely
sharing the cluster certificates with
the other control plane nodes that will
join. Now we're only going to be using
one control plane for example. And then
we are going to advertise the address of
this of this control plane. Now the IP
addresses have changed since the early
earlier part of the video.
So now this is going to give us two
commands. So this is the command that
says you can now join any number of the
control plane nodes running the
following command. So basically if we
had other control plane nodes we'd run
this command. And for the worker node
we can run this command. Okay. Now we'll
just run we'll just paste in the
command. And this is the standard worker
join command that we're going to use to
add the worker nodes to the AJ cluster.
All now nodes will now point to the load
balancer as the API server endpoint.
Role-based access control or RBAC is the
primary mechanism for regulating access
to resources within a Kubernetes
cluster. It determines what you can do
after you've proven who you are. A deep
understanding of RBAC is essential for
securing a cluster. RBAC is built on
four key API objects. A role which
contains a set of rules that represent
permissions. Roles are namespaced,
meaning they only grant access to
resources within a single namespace. A
cluster role is the same as RO but is
non-namespaced.
It can be used to grant permissions to
cluster scoped resources or to resources
across all namespaces. A role binding
grants the permissions defined in a role
to a set of users, groups or service
accounts. It's also namespaced and
connects a subject to a role within that
namespace. And finally, a cluster role
binding grants the permissions of a
cluster role to subjects clusterwide.
Okay, let's talk about granting readonly
access. I'm going to demonstrate the
standard workflow for creating a
dedicated service account for an
application and granting it restricted
readonly access to pods within a
specific name space. We're going to
follow the principle of least privilege.
We don't want to give an application
full admin rights if it only needs to
read some information. That's why we're
creating a special identity for an
application called a service account and
giving it just enough permission to read
pods in a specific name space and
nothing more. So we are so let's create
an isolated workspace for this
experiment. A namespace is like a
virtual cluster inside your main
cluster. Helps keeps things organized
and prevents us from accidentally
affecting other applications. So cube
controller create namespace RBAC test.
So the name space is called RBAC-
test. Okay, we're going to create a
service account. We need an identity for
our application. In Kubernetes, you
don't give permissions directly to a
pod. Instead, you give them to a service
account and then you tell the pod to use
that account. Think of it as a user but
for a program instead of a person. So
let's create a service account named dev
user. So this command right here we're
going to use to create a service account
called dev user in our new namespace.
So not the default one. Okay. Service
account dev user created.
Now step three define the permissions
with a role. So for the core of RBAC we
need to define a set of permissions. In
Kubernetes, a role is an object that
contains rules representing a set of
permissions within a single namespace.
So we're going to create a YAML file
named ro.yamel. So nanorrolly
and we're going to define a pod reader
role. So I'm going to paste this role in
here. This role will only allow read
only actions on our pods. So we have the
kind role metadata. We have the name
space the name. So then the rules are is
where we define what actions are
allowed. So for the resources pods that
means the permissions only apply only to
pods not deployments not services just
pods. And then we have the verbs get
list and watch. These are the allowed
actions. So you can get a single pod,
list all pods and watch for changes and
we're not including create, delete or
update. So that's what makes it read
only. So we'll just save this.
And now I'm going to apply the manifest
to the cluster. So cubecontroller apply
ro.yml.
And this command takes the blueprint
from our YAML file and creates the
actual RO object inside our Kubernetes
cluster.
Okay, step four is connect the user and
the RO with a RO binding. So far we have
a user, the dev user, and a set of
permissions pod reader, but they are not
connected. We need to bind them
together. A role binding does exactly
that. It grants the permissions defined
in RO to a user or a set of users. So
first we're going to create a file. So
um nano
rolebinding.yaml
and this is where we'll define our our
role binding. So
so I'm just going to paste in the text
of this here. So let's break this down.
We have our kind with role binding and
then we know the what the name space is.
We're using the name. So subjects this
defines who gets permission. So in our
case it's the service account named dev
user in this name space. And then we
have the role ref. This defines what
permissions they get. We're referencing
the pod reader role that we just
created. So I can save this. And now I
will apply the manifest to make the
connection official.
Okay, we got that created.
Now we'll verify the permissions. So
this is a pretty important step. Testing
our work. Did we configure everything
correctly? Kubernetes has a fantastic
built-in command to check this. So just
paste in the command here. It's the cube
controller o can I and it this is what
we use to ask the Kubernetes API server
if a user can perform a certain action.
So can I list pods? So that's the action
and then the - flag lets us impersonate
our service account. So, we put our
account name, the dev dev user, right in
there. And then we can just run this to
see if we can do it. So, it says yes,
that's what we wanted. So, now let's
test a negative case. Can our dev user
delete pods? So, I'm going to paste in
another command here. Can I delete pods
as the the users that we just created?
No. Uh we cannot delete pods. And there
you have it. The first command returned
yes and the second return no which
confirms our the RBAC policy is working
perfectly. Our dev user account can read
pods but cannot perform any destructive
actions. This is a fundamental pattern
for securing your Kubernetes
applications.
While cube controller apply-f is
fundamental, managing complex
applications with many interdependent
manifests can become cumbersome. Helm
and customize are two popular tools that
streamline this process. Helm is the de
facto package manager for Kubernetes. It
allows you to define, install, and
upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes
applications as packages called charts.
Charts are a collection of files that
describe a related set of Kubernetes
resources packaged as a single unit.
Values are part of a values.yaml file
which provides the default configuration
values that can be overridden at install
time. A release is an instance of a
chart running in a Kubernetes cluster.
Customize is a template-free tool for
customizing Kubernetes manifests. It's
built directly into cube controller via
the - k flag and works by applying
patches and overlays to a common set of
base YAML files. This approach avoids
the complexity of templating languages.
Okay, let's see this in action. First,
let's install Helm, which is the package
manager for Kubernetes. We'll install
we'll install it using the official
installation script, which is the
quickest way to get started on a Linux
system like our control plane. So this
command is going to download the
official helm installation script and
then pipe it directly to the bash shell
to be executed. This will install the
latest version of helm onto you into
user/local/bin.
Now we can just check to make sure it
works with helm version.
Okay, we got this installed. So let's
see things everything in action by
installing an engineext web server.
First, we need to tell Helm where to
find the charts we want to use. So, we
have this command here, Helm repo add
bit nami. And then we have the URL here.
So, we're adding the popular Bitnami
repository which contains hundreds of
readytouse charts. And it's been added
to our repositories. Now, we can do Helm
re Helm repo update.
And this is going to fetch the latest
list of charts from all our added repos.
And then we get this fun message, happy
helming. So now that helm knows where to
look, we can install our engineext
chart. So we have helm install my
engineext vietnami/engineex
set service.ype equals nodeport.
So this creates a new release. So we
have the name for our release that's my
engine X is the name that we're giving
it and the chart to install here and
then the set flag
uh will override a default value in the
charts configuration to expose engineext
using a node port service making it
accessible from outside the cluster and
just like that with one command Helm has
created deployment a service and another
and other resources the engineext chart
are needed. We do have some warnings,
but none of those will make this not
work. You can now manage the entire life
cycle of this application with commands
like helm upgrade, helm roll black, roll
back, and helm uninstall. It's very
powerful. Now, let's talk about
customize template free customization.
So, while helm uses a templating
language, customize takes a different
template-free approach. It lets you
define a common set of base YAML files
and then apply layers of customizations
or overlays on top of them. This is
perfect for when you have a core
application that needs slight
modifications for different environments
like de development, staging and
production. So let's set up a project to
see how it works. Imagine we have a
simple enginex application. So first
we'll create our base configuration.
This is the standard default version of
our app. So first I'm going to make a
directory my app/base.
And now and now we'll create our
deployment file. You can create the file
in any way you want. Previously I use
nano. Now we're just using cat. Here you
can see this deployment has one replica
and we have it we have the labels. We
have the the app, the name of the app.
We have containers engine x and the
image we're using. And every customized
directory needs a customization.yamel
file. That's what we're creating here.
This tells it which resources to manage.
So the resources are just the ones
specified in the deployment.yamel file
that we just created. Okay. Now that we
have our base, we can create an overlay
for our production environment. In
production, we need higher availability.
So, we want to run three replicas
instead of one. So, I'm going to make
our the production directory
the overlays production directory. And
now we're creating a patch.yaml file.
This file contains only the changes we
want to make. Customize will
strategically merge this into the base
deployment. So now we are saying that
it's going to be three replicas.
Okay. Now just like before we need to
make our customization.yamel file in the
production directory and we uh basically
this file for overlay points to the base
and then lists the patches to apply. So
we're just going to apply this
patch.yaml YAML file that we made.
So, we're all set. We have our base. We
have our production overlay that changes
the replica count. Now, to deploy our
production configuration, we use the
same cube controller apply command. You
can see it down at the bottom. And now
we but now we have a - K flag that will
point to our overlay directory.
So this will read the base apply the
production pass patch and then send the
final merge configuration to the
Kubernetes API server
and it is notifying that we should not
use bases we should use resources
but it looks like we can just fix that
with customizeedit
fix. Oh yeah we don't have the customize
command line tool. So we just have to
fix that manually
with nano
and then the name of our file and then
we can change this word bases to
resources and then we can just exit out
of that. Okay. So now we have that
updated.
So now the next time we run the
cubernetes cube controller apply we
won't see that warning but it's going to
work either way. Okay. Now let's see if
everything worked. We're going to run
cubecontroller getit deployment my app
and we can see that it has three it has
three replicas or zero out of three
replicas uh just as we specified in our
production overlay. We've successfully
customized our application without ever
touching the base files or dealing with
complex templates. It's a very clean and
declarative way to manage environment
specific configurations.
While they have different philosophies,
Helm and Customize can be used together.
A common pattern is to use Helm template
to generate the base manifests from a
chart and then use customize to apply
environment specific patches before
applying them to the cluster. And this
chart shows the key differences between
Helm and Customize.
Kubernetes is designed to be extensible.
Its core functionality can be enhanced
through standardized interfaces and by
adding custom resource types. The CRI or
container runtime interface is a plug-in
interface that enables the cublet to use
a wide variety of container runtimes
without needing to recompile Kubernetes.
The CNI or container network interface
is a specification for configuring
network interfaces for Linux containers.
It allows different networking solutions
to integrate with Kubernetes to provide
pod networking. The CSI or container
storage interface is a standard for
exposing storage systems to
containerized workloads. It allows
thirdparty storage vendors to develop
plugins that work across different
container orchestrators, including
Kubernetes, without having to add their
code to the core Kubernetes repository.
A custom resource definition or CRD is a
powerful feature that allows you to
extend the Kubernetes API with your own
custom resource types. If you want to
manage a new type of object like a
database, you can create a CRD for it
and then interact interact with it using
cube controller just like a built-in
resource like a pod. An operator is a
custom controller that uses CRDs to
manage applications and their
components. It follows Kubernetes
principles, notably the control loop, to
automate complex operational tasks. For
example, a database operator could
automate backups, failovers, and
upgrades for a database cluster defined
by a custom resource.
This part focuses on the core objects
used to run applications on Kubernetes.
It covers how to manage application life
cycles with deployments, how to inject
configuration data, how to automatically
scale workloads, and how to control
where and how pods are scheduled on the
clusters nodes. Deployments are the
standard way to run stateless
applications. They provide fine grain
control over updating and rolling back
application versions with zero downtime.
The default update strategy for
deployments is rolling update. This
strategy ensures that the application
remains available during an update by
incrementally replacing old pods with
new ones. The behavior of a rolling
update is controlled by two key
parameters in the deployment spec.
Spec.strategy.rollingupdate.mmax
unavailable is the maximum number of
pods that can be unavailable during the
update. Spec.st strategy.rollingupdate
Rolling update.mmax surge is the maximum
number of new pods that can be created
over the desired number of replicas.
A rolling update is Kubernetes elegant
solution to the challenge of updating a
running application. Instead of taking
everything down at once, Kubernetes
carefully replaces old pods with new
ones one by one, ensuring your
application remains available to users
throughout the entire process. So let's
see this in action. First, we need an
application to work with. Now, in a
previous section, we created an
application, but we're just going to
create one again for this section. We'll
create a simple engine X deployment
running an older version of the
software.
So I did nano deployment.yaml to create
this deployment file. And so this
manifest defines deployment named
engineext deployment that maintains
three replicas of pods. Each pod runs a
single container with the engineext
image and specifically the 1.24.0
which is an older version. So, I'll just
save this and then we can deploy it to
our cluster with cubecontroller
apply-floyment.yaml.
Okay, we got that deployed. Okay, so now
we're going to trigger the rolling
update. So, we're going to update our
application to a newer version of
EngineX. The simplest way to trigger a
rolling update is to change the
container image tag in the deployment
spec. We can do this directly from the
command line. So I have this command
here. QController set image
deployment/engineext
deployment. That's what we just created
up here. And then engineext equals
engineext 1.25.0.
Remember it was 1.24.0.
So this basically tells Kubernetes to
find the deployment, locate the
container name engine X and update its
image to engineext 1.25.0. So we can do
this. Okay, image updated. So this is
the cool part. Kubernetes is now
performing the rolling updates the
update in the background. We can watch
it happen from two different
perspectives. First we can use the
rollout status command. So if I paste
this in cubecontroller roll out status
and we put the name of the deployment
and you can see wait it waiting to
finish uh one out of three new replicas
have been updated. So this command will
block and give you live updates on the
rollout process. It's basically a highle
overview. Now I'm going to open up a new
another terminal tab and I'll zoom in a
bit. Here we can watch the individual
pods as they replaced. So we have
qcontroller get pods-l
and then this is the label that we're
looking for. The pods with that label-w
means we're going to get a real time
feed. Okay. Okay. And here's what it
looks like after they've all been
updated. Now they're running again after
they're stopped and created and running
again.
Kubernetes maintains a revision history
for each deployment, allowing you to
easily roll back to a previous stable
version if an update introduces a bug.
This triggers another rolling update.
This time replacing the new pods with
pods running the image from the previous
revision. Now let's talk about executing
and verifying rollbacks.
What if our new version 1.25.0 has a
critical bug? One of the most powerful
features of deployments is the built-in
revision history which acts as a safety
net. So let's see the history of changes
we've made to our deployment. So put in
this command cubecontroller rollout
history deployment engineext deployment.
Okay, we can see the list of revisions.
So revision one was our initial
deployment with 1.24.0 and then we have
our current update 1.25.0.
So let's roll back to the previous
version. Let's say the new version is
faulty. We can instantly revert to the
last known good configuration with a
simple undo command. So I'll just undo
the deployment. So now if we're going to
watch the pods again, we would see the
same rolling update process but in
reverse. Uh so it it go it terminates
the 1.25.0 pods and replace them with
the 1.24.0
pods. You can also roll back to a
specific version. So if we use this
command undo and then two revision
equals one. So this is useful if you
need to go back more than one step in
your deployment history. uh in our case
we only have one one or two steps.
It's a best practice to decouple
application code from configuration.
Kubernetes provides two primary
resources for this. Config maps for
nonsensitive data and secrets for
sensitive data. A config map is an API
object used to store non-confidential
data in key value pairs. Pods can
consume config maps as environment
variables, command line arguments, or as
configuration files in a volume. So
let's see how to create a config map
imperatively. So this line here is going
to create a config map named app config
with two key value pairs. See app.c
color is blue and app.m mode is
production. So see it says config map
created. You can also create a a config
map from a files contents. So here we're
going to put the retries equals 3 into
the file config.properties
and then cubecontroller create config
map app-config
from fileconfig.properties.
So we're creating it from that file. You
can also create a config map
declaratively. So for production it's
always better to define resources in
YAML files so you can check them into
version control. So I'm going to create
a file called config map.yamel
and then I'll paste in the code here or
the yaml and then you can see we have
the name and then we have the data. So
database URL is the URL ui theme is
dark. So these are the settings and now
after creating our config.yaml we just
have to do qcontroller apply to apply
the config map. A secret is an object
that stores sensitive information like
passwords, API keys, or TLS
certificates. The data in a secret is
stored in B 64 encoding. It's important
to understand that B 64 is an encoding,
not an encryption. It provides no real
security and can be easily decoded. True
security for secrets relies on enabling
encryption at rest for ATCD and using
RBAC to restrict access to the secrets
objects themselves. So let's look at the
creation method. So here's how to create
a secret imperatively. Kubernetes will
automatically base 64 encode the string
values here admin and secret the S3C
R3T.
So they'll be encoded and our secret our
db-credentials
is created and you can also create with
YAML creating a secrets declaratively.
So if I create this YAML file and I'll
paste in some YAML here. Uh so with when
using YAML you have a very convenient
field called string data. This lets you
provide plain text values and Kubernetes
will handle the base 64 encoding for you
automatically when the secret is
created. This is much easier than
encoding the values yourself. So if I
save this. Okay. Now let's talk about
using config maps and secrets in pods.
So I've created our configuration
objects. So we're now going to use them.
So one common method is to expose keys
from config maps and secrets as
environment variables inside a
container. So let's create a pod that
does this. So I'm going to create the
file pod config.yaml. So we're creating
a pod just like we've shown before and
we can inject a values from the config
map. So value from config map keyref. So
this is the config map's name and this
is the key. So we're pulling this value
from this the config map and putting it
into our theme environment variable. And
then we can inject a value from our
secret very similar way. Secret key ref
from db-credentials
and the password. And so that's going to
be injected into our db password
environment variable. So I'm just going
to save this and let's create this pod
with qcontroller reply podconfig.yml.
And now let's check its logs.
QController logs config demo pod. Okay.
Now if we look at the logs here, we can
see that the theme and the password have
been set. Now let's talk about mounting
as a volume. Another powerful method is
to mount a config map or secret as a
volume. This makes the data appear as
files inside the container which is
perfect for applications that expect to
read configuration from disk.
So let me just put in this YAML here.
This manifest tells Kubernetes to create
a volume called config volume using the
data from our app-configile
config map. It then mounts the volume
inside our container at /c/config.
So this is what we're mounting here. And
each key in the config map becomes a
file in that directory. So let's exit
out of this and we'll save it. So we'll
create this and check the logs. So
cubecontroller apply pod-vol.yamel YAML
and then cubecontroller logs
volume-demo-pod
and the output is retries equals 3 which
is the content of the file we created by
mounting our config map. This shows just
how flexible Kubernetes is for managing
application configuration.
Kubernetes can automatically scale the
number of pods in a workload based on
resource utilization. This is handled by
the horizontal pod autoscaler or HPA.
The HPA relies on a source of metrics to
make scaling decisions. The most common
source of basic CPU and memory metrics
is the metric server, a cluster add-on
that collects resource metrics from each
cublet and exposes them through the
cubernetes API. So this is how you
install the metric server. basically
just cubecontroller reply-f and then we
have the URL where we download the
metric server from and then we can see
metric server created. So we should be
able to verify the installation and
fetch metrics using this cube controller
top nodes. If you get an error that
sometimes can happen in self-hosted
Kubernetes clusters like this one and
it's trying to securely verify the
self-signed certificates of the nodes or
the cublets which it cannot do by
default. So the fix is to edit the
metric server deployment and add a
command line argument that tells it to
skip this verification. Now, you may not
have this problem, but we'll do
cubecontroller edit deployment metric
server and then and then we'll just go
down here to the args and then we can
just add an extra line here. Cubullet
cublet insecure TLS and I'll just save
and quit. We just finished editing that.
Now, we just have to wait a minute for
the pods to start and become ready. We
can always use get pods to check the
status. I mean cube controller get pods.
Okay, the metric server is running. So
we should be able to do get controller
top nodes. Okay, now we can see that we
can see the metrics here. And then we
can also do get cubecontroller top pods
a and we can see the metrics for the
pods. Okay, the metric server is working
correctly.
The HPA controller periodically queries
the metrics API and adjusts the replicas
field of a target resource to bring the
current metric value closer to the
target value you define. A critical
prerequisite for CPU or memory based
autoscaling is that the containers in
the target workload must have resource
requests defined. The HPA calculates
utilization as a percentage of these
requests. Without them, the HPA cannot
function. So the HPA needs a target to
scale. Let's create a simple PHP Apache
deployment. The most critical part of
this manifest is the resource request.
So do nano hba demo deployment.yml and
then we'll create the deployment. So
we'll look closely at the
resources.request.cpu
2000m
line. This is essential. It tells
Kubernetes that this pod needs about 20%
of a CPU core to run. The HPA uses this
request as a baseline. When we tell the
HPA to target 50% CPU utilization, it
means 50% of this 200 millores request.
Without a resource request, the HBA has
no idea what the processing percentage
is relative to and it won't work. So I'm
going to save that and let's apply this
manifest and then expose it as a service
so we can send traffic to it. So we
apply with cubecontroller apply and then
we'll create a cluster IP service named
PHP apache to explo expose the
deployment on port 80. Okay, now that we
have our application running let's
create the HPA the horizontal pod
autoscaler to manage it. We'll use a
simple cubecontroller autoscale command.
So this command here creates an HPA
resource. So the autoscale deployment a
PHP Apache. We're telling the HPA to
target our PHP Apache deployment. Then
the CPU percent 50. This is our goal.
The HPA will try to keep the average CPU
utilization across all pods at 50% of
their requested CPU. And then the min
equals 1. This is the minimum number of
replicas. The HPA will never scale down
below one pod. And then we have max 10,
which is our safety limit. The HPA will
never create more than 10 pods,
protecting us from runaway scaling event
that could crash our cluster or run up a
huge cloud bill. Okay, our HPA is ready,
but right now it's just sitting idle
because our application has no traffic.
Let's fix that. We'll run a temporary
pod that sits in an infinite loop
constantly sending requests to our PHP
Apache service. This will drive up the
CPU usage and trigger the autoscaler. So
this is what we're going to be running.
So this is going to be the loop while
true. And then basically it's just going
to So you see the -at runs the pod
interactively. The dash rm cleans it up
automatically when we exit. And we're
using a tiny busy box image. And this
command is a simple shell script that
downloads the homepage from our service
over and over again. Okay, it looks like
our server needs a file to serve. So, we
just need to create a file for it to
serve. So, so we're going to delete the
deployment and delete the service. We're
going to have to redo something here.
And then this command is going to create
a new config map named PHP-index
that contains a simple PHP script. The
script is designed to perform some
calculations to generate the CPU load
needed for our HPA demo. Now we need to
tell our deployment to mount the file
from our config map into Apache's web
root directory. And I added a new
section to the file. We have this volume
mounts section and then the the volume
section down here. So we'll save and
close the file and then we'll apply the
updated deployment and then we just have
to uh ex expose as a service again. Now
in one terminal we're going to watch HVA
with this cube control get HVA and then
I'm going to open up a new terminal and
then we'll run the load generator again.
Okay, that's working. So now over here
we can see we have the cube controller
get HPA-W
and we can watch the HPA status the
because we have the - W it's giving us a
live feed and we can see we can see the
initial state. So in the targets uh we
can see it's um a very low number 2% of
50 to 0% of 50 but then the load
increases. So a after a mint the metric
server reports the high CPU usage from
our load generator we see the target is
going to 270%
134%
this means that the current average CPU
is is like here is 270%
of our 50% target so now we can see um
as soon as the HPA sees the target is
exceeded it springs in action. So we'll
see the replica count. So see it was
114610.
It's come that's the maximum is 10. The
HPA is adding more pods to spread the
load. And then so uh since more pods are
being act added we can see the load goes
back down. Now we're just at 41%. So
everything's been stabilized. So we can
go over here and stop this. I'll just do
command or control C. If we go back over
here, we can now see a scale down if if
we wait a little bit. So now we can see
this has gone to 4%. 4% of 50 and then
eventually the replicas would also go
back down to one. So that's it. We just
witnessed a fully automated
resource-based scaling in Kubernetes.
This is a fundamental concept for
building resilient and efficient
applications.
Beyond basic configuration, Kubernetes
offers several mechanisms to create
robust self-healing application
deployments.
Health probes are checks performed by
the cublet to determine the health of a
container. A livveness probe determines
if a container is running. If the
livveness probe fails, the cublet kills
the container and the container is
subject to its restart policy. A
readiness probe determines if a
container is ready to serve traffic. If
the readiness probe fails, the endpoints
controller removes the pod's IP address
from the endpoints of all services that
match the pod. A startup probe indicates
whether the containerized application
has started successfully. If a startup
probe is configured, it disables
livveness and readiness checks until it
succeeds, protecting slow starting
applications from being killed
prematurely. Okay, let's get hands-on
and see how to make our applications
more robust and control exactly where
they run in our cluster. We'll start by
configuring health probes to teach
Kubernetes how to tell if our
application is truly health healthy. So,
we're going to create a pod with two
different types of probes. A readiness
probe to see if the app is ready for
traffic and a livveness probe to check
if it's still running correctly. Okay,
I'm creating this file pod probe.yaml
we'll use to set up set this up. Okay,
so here's our file. Let's break this
down before we apply it. Under readiness
probe, we're using an HTTP get probe.
This tells the Kubernetes the cublet to
send an HTTP get request to the
container's port 80 on the path just the
home path or slash. If it gets a
successful response, a 200 level status
code, the container is considered ready.
The initial delay seconds, the cublet
will wait five seconds after the
container starts before performing the
first readiness check, which gives our
app time to start up. And then we have
the period seconds of 10. The cublet
will perform this readiness check check
every 10 seconds. And then under
liveness probe, we're using a TCP socket
probe. That's right here. And this is a
simpler check. The cublet just tries to
obtain a TCP connection on port 80. If
it can connect, the app is considered
alive. And uh these ones are just the
same as before. Okay. So we can save
this and we'll start. We'll create the
pod controller reply. So we got that
created. Now to now to see this in
action, we will do cubecontrol describe
pod. And if we look at this events
section, we can see the messages from
the cublet as it executes the probes.
You'll see it successfully checked the
liveness and readiness of the container.
Now let's see what happen when a probe
fails. The readiness probe is the
easiest to demonstrate. Let's say we
deploy a new version with a typo in the
health check endpoint. We can simulate
this by deleting the pod and uh changing
the path and a readiness probe to
something that doesn't exist. So do
cubec control delete pod probe demo and
then we'll go into the editing and then
so for this path we'll just change this
to bad and then we can just save this
again and then we just have to reapply
it and then we can go back to the
describe pod. Now I'm going to do get
pod uh probe demo. We can see it's zero
out of one already. The pro the pod is
running but it's not ready to accept
traffic. And then if we do the describe
again, we can see the readiness probe
fails. HTB probe failed with status 404.
If this pod were part of a service,
Kubernetes would already have removed it
from the pool of available endpoints,
protecting our users from serious
errors. This is an this is an important
tool for zero downtime deployments.
Setting resource requests and limits is
important for stable cluster operation.
Requests are the amount of CPU and
memory that is guaranteed for a
container. The Kubernetes uses the
request value to decide which node to
place the pod on. Limits are the maximum
amount of CPU memory that a container is
allowed to use. The cublet enforces
these limits. If a container exceeds its
CPU limit, it will be throttled. If it
exceeds its memory limit, it will be
terminated with an oom killed or out of
memory error. The relationship between
resource requests, scheduling, and
autoscaling is a critical system to
understand. A failure to set requests
prevents the HPA from functioning.
Setting requests too high can cause pods
to become stuck in a pending state if no
single node has enough allocatable
resources to satisfy the request.
Setting limits too low can cause
applications to be killed unexpectedly
under load. A competent administrator
must grasp this entire causal chain to
design and troubleshoot workloads
effectively.
The Kubernetes scheduler makes
intelligent decisions about where to
place pods. Administrators can influence
these decisions using several
mechanisms. Node affinity attracts pods
to a set of nodes based on labels on the
nodes. It allows you to constrain which
nodes your pod is eligible to be
scheduled on. There are two types.
Required during scheduling ignored
during execution, which is a hard
requirement. The scheduler will only
place the pod on a node that matches the
rule. And preferred during scheduling
ignored during execution, which is a
soft requirement. The scheduler will try
to find a node that matches the rule,
but will schedule the pod elsewhere if
it cannot. Now, let's control where our
pods get scheduled. Node affinity is
like telling a pod, I'd like you to run
on nodes that have this specific
characteristic. We do this with labels.
So, uh, first let's add a label to our
worker node. So, I do cubecontroller get
nodes to get the nodes. We can see our
worker node is just ks worker. So,
cubecontroller label node and we're on
the control plane node, but we can label
the worker node from here. And so we're
giving it the label disk type equals
SSD. Uh so we're kind of pretending like
it has a solid state drive. Okay, we got
that labeled. So now we can create a pod
that requires this label. So I'm going
to create a file affinity pod.yaml.
And inside the affinity section here, uh
we are setting a hard requirement. The
match expressions part says the
scheduler must place the key the the pod
on a node where the disk type label has
a value that is in this list of values
here which in this case is just SSD. So
we're just going to close that or save
that and close it. And then I'll apply
with cubecontroller apply-finity
pod.yml.
And to verify that it worked, we'll get
our pods and use the - o wide flag,
which shows us which node each pod is
running on. And let me just zoom out a
little bit so it's easier to see this.
And we can see the SSD pod which is
being run on the KS worker node because
that's the only node that matched our
affinity rule. Actually, in this case,
that's the only node we even have. But
if we had multiple nodes, then we this
would make sure that the SSD pod or it's
only worker node we have. And that's how
you would make it go to a very specific
worker node. The scheduler correctly
ignored the control plane node because
it didn't have the required label. It
did not get scheduled on the control
plane node. Taints and tolerations work
together to ensure that pods are not
scheduled onto inappropriate nodes. A
taint is applied to a node which marks
it as repelling certain pods. A
toleration is applied to a pod allowing
it to be scheduled on a node with a
matching taint. Taints have one of three
effects. No schedule, which means no new
pods will be scheduled on the tainted
node unless they have a matching
toleration. Prefer no schedule, which
means the scheduler will try to avoid
placing pods without a matching
toleration on the node. and no execute
which evicts any running pods from the
node that do not tolerate the taint. So
let's taint our worker node. So we will
add a taint that says this node is
reserved for GPU application. So unless
it's GPU no schedule. Um so the no
schedule effect means no new pods will
be scheduled on this node unless they
have a matching toleration. Okay, so
it's tainted now. Now let's try to
schedule a regular engineext pod without
any special permission. So it's created
and if we do get pods o wide and normal
pod this is one we just created we can
see it's not on any node because uh it
in it avoided the tainted worker node in
a real cluster. It would say pending if
no other nodes are available. So now
let's create a special pod that can run
on our GPU node. So we're creating this
file toleration pod.yaml and we can see
that we have a value of GPU effect no
schedule. So let's close this save it
and we can apply that. And then we will
go to our get pods again. And we can see
our GPU pod did get scheduled onto our
worker node here. It has the right key
to bypass the no trespassing sign. So
this is how you create a dedicated nodes
for special workloads ensuring that only
the right applications can run on them.
Networking is a central and complex part
of Kubernetes. This section covers how
Kubernetes facilitates communication
between pods, exposes applications to
internal and external traffic, and
secures network pathways. A solid grasp
of these concepts is important for
deploying and troubleshooting
multicomponent applications. The
fundamental networking model in
Kubernetes is that every pod receives
its own unique IP address within the
cluster. Crucially, every pod can
communicate with every other pod on any
other node without needing network
address translation ornat. This flat
networking model is implemented by a
container network interface or CNI
plug-in. When you install a CNI like
Calico or Flannel, it takes
responsibility for assigning IP
addresses to pods and configuring the
necessary routing on each node to enable
this direct communication. While pods
have unique IPs, they are ephemeral.
They can be created and destroyed and
their IPs can change. This makes direct
communication with pod IPs unreliable.
The service object solves this problem
by providing a stable abstraction layer
over a logical set of pods. A service
gets a stable virtual IP address or the
cluster IP and a DNS name and it uses a
selector to identify the group of
backend pods it should forward traffic
to. There are several types of services
each designed for a different use case.
This is the default service type. It
exposes the service on a cluster
internal IP address. This makes the
service reachable only from within the
cluster. It's the standard way to enable
communication between different
microservices running inside the same
cluster. Okay, let's see how Kubernetes
networking works in practice. We'll
start with the most fundamental object
for exposing applications which is the
service. So this is about the cluster IP
service. we need an application to
expose. So this time we'll create a
simple enginex deployment with two
replicas. The important thing to notice
here is that Kubernetes will
automatically add the label app equals
my app to the pods it creates. Okay, we
got that created. If you've been
following along, you may have to do
delete deployment my app to delete the
one that we already created earlier in
this tutorial because I want to make
sure it's um different for this section
of the tutorial. So now that our pods
are running, we'll create um a cluster
IP service to give them a stable
internal IP address. So like usual,
we'll do this declaratively using a YAML
file. So I'm going to create this file
cluster IP service.yaml. And let's look
at this file. We have the type of
cluster IP, which is a default, but
we're being explicit here. The most
important line selector app my app, the
critical link. Um, this tells a service,
find all the pods in this name space
that have the label app equals my app
and send traffic to them. It's the
bridge between the service and the pods.
So, I will exit this, save it, and now
we'll apply it. So, now that the service
is created, we can test it. Since it's a
cluster IP, it's only accessible from
inside the cluster. So, we will launch a
temporary pod and use it as a shell to
test our connection. That's what this
line is doing right here. Okay. Now that
we're inside our temporary pod, we can
access our EngineX application simply by
using the services name. So, I'm just
going to w get my app service. And there
it is, the EngineX welcome page. This
proves our service is currently routing
traffic to our backend pods. Now we'll
just type in exit to destroy our
temporary pod.
A node port service exposes the
application on a static port on each
node's IP address. A node port service
automatically creates a cluster IP
service and the node port routes traffic
to this internal cluster IP. This is
useful for development or for exposing a
service when a cloud load balancer is
not available. Now let's expose our
application to the outside world using a
node port. This is great for development
or when you don't have a cloud load
balancer. So let's create a file called
no nodeport service.yaml.
And the only major change here is this
type nodeport. So let's create this. So
I'll save it. And now we'll just apply
the node port service. Uh what we
created that and to access this we need
two pieces of information. the IP
address of one of our nodes and the port
that Kuberneti Kubernetes uh assigned.
So let's get the service details to find
the port. So in the output we can look
at the port column and that is our node
port the 32149.
Now we'll do the get nodes wide to make
sure we can get our worker nodes IP
address which is right here
192.1681.161.
So we'll just try doing a curl hp
slash and then we can put in the IP
address and then the node port number.
Okay. And we can see the engineext
welcome page. So we've successfully
accessed our cluster from the outside.
And now look at this. Um, I've been
running Kubernetes in a virtual machine
on my Mac OS. And now I just went to a
web web browser on my Mac OS, not even
in the virtual machine. And I can still
access the engineext welcome page from
that URL from the IP address and the
port number.
Creating a load balancer service
automatically provisions a node port and
a cluster IP service to which the
external load balancer will route
traffic. As each service requires its
own load balancer and public IP. Ingress
and the newer gateway API provide more
sophisticated ways to manage external
access enabling L7 or HTTP/HTPS
routing. An ingress is a Kubernetes API
object that manages external access to
the services in a cluster, typically
HTTP. It can provide load balancing, SSL
termination, and namebased virtual
hosting. An ingress resource itself does
nothing. It requires an ingress
controller to be running in the cluster
to be fulfilled. The ingress controller
is a reverse proxy that watches the
Kubernetes API for ingress resources and
configures itself accordingly. Now,
let's talk about path-based routing with
ingress. What if we have multiple
services but only want to use one
external IP? That's what ingress is used
for. It's a smart router for our
cluster. So, first we need to install an
ingress controller. We'll use the
popular EngineX ingress controller.
Okay. Now, let's deploy two different
applications. We'll use a simple echo
server image that just echoes back
information about the request. So here
we are going to deploy and expose the
first app. Create deployment app one and
then we get the echo server and then we
expose it. And so that one is done. And
now we'll do the same thing with app
two. And so we got that one ready as
well. Okay. Now for the core of the
demo, we'll create an ingress resource
that defines our routing roles. So let
me start by creating a YAML file. And
now we have this file that says if an
incoming request is going to slapp one,
route it to our app one service. And
then if it's going to app 2, route it to
our app 2 service. So I will save that
and then we can apply it just with
cubecontroller apply ingress. YAML.
Okay. Now we need to test it. Uh there's
kind of a few ways. If uh we could get
the external IP, but we're not going to
have an external IP because we're just
running it locally. But the load
balancer service automatically creates a
node port as a fallback. And we can use
this port along with the worker nodes IP
address to access the ingress
controller. So let's get the details of
the ingress engineext controller service
to find out the port it's exposed on. So
here we can see it's 32733.
And basically this is very similar to
what we did just very recently in the
tutorial where we get the IP address of
our worker node and then we can just
combine it with the port here. Okay. We
can run this curl command with the IP
address and the port number we got and
then the slash app one and we got it.
Now let's go to app two and it works.
The first command returns a response
from the app one pod. The second returns
a response from app 2. So we've
successfully read traffic to two
different services using a single IP
address and different URL paths. So
that's the power of ingress.
The gateway API is an official
Kubernetes project that represents the
next generation of Ingress. It's
designed to be more expressive,
flexible, and role oriented. It
decouples the configuration into three
main resource types. Gateway class is a
cluster scoped template defining a type
of load balancer. Gateway defines where
and how the load balancer listens for
traffic. And finally, HTTP route and
others like TCP route defines protocol
specific routing rules. The separation
of roles allows infrastructure teams to
manage the gateways while application
teams manage their own routing rules
safely.
While a load balancer service is
effective for exposing a single service,
it can be inefficient and costly. By
default, all pods in a Kubernetes
cluster can communicate with all other
pods. Network policies act as a firewall
for pods, allowing you to control
traffic flow at the IP address and port
level or layer 3 and 4. To enforce
network policies, you must use a CNI
plugin that supports them, such as
Calico, Celium, or WeaveNet. A common
and highly recommended security practice
is to start with a default deny policy
that blocks all traffic and then
explicitly add allow rules for required
communication paths. Let's talk about
securing an application with network
policies. By default, any pod can talk
to any other pod. Let's lock that down
using network policies which act as a
firewall. So, we're going to create a
default policy, a default deny policy,
which is a security best practice. So we
got this file deny all and then we got a
this is how you make it the pod selector
it's empty so select all p all pods and
then it it we're providing no ingress
rules which means it blocks all incoming
traffic so we can save that we can apply
it and then I'll just create a engineext
server really quick and then we will
expose it deploy it so I'm going to try
to connect so basically we're creating a
temporary shell. And then I'm going to
run this wget command with a timeout of
two because we expect it to fail. Okay,
it failed, which is perfect. Our deny
policy is working. Now, let's create a
specific allow rule. We'll create a
policy that allows our web server, but
only from pods that have the the label
access true. Okay. So, I'll create a new
YAML file and then we're allowing from
uh from pods that have the label access
equals true. So, I will save that. I
will apply it. And now we'll run our
client pod again, but this time we will
give it a label access true. Okay. Now,
we should be able to get the EngineX
welcome page. We have successfully
implemented a firewall inside our
cluster, locking down traffic and only
allowing specific required connections.
Core DNS is the default DNS server for
Kubernetes. It's a flexible extensible
DNS server that provides service
discovery within the cluster. When you
create a service, core DNS automatically
creates DNS records that allow other
pods in the cluster to resolve the
service by its name. The standard DNS
records follow this pattern. For a
service, it's service name.namespace.
SVC.cluster.local.
And for a pod, it's
pod-iped.namespace.pod.cluster.local.
CoreDNS is configured via a config map
in the cube system namespace which
contains a core file. The core file uses
a plug-in base architecture to process
DNS queries. Key default plugins include
Kubernetes which answers DNS queries
based on Kubernetes services and pods.
Forward which forwards queries that
cannot be resolved within the cluster to
an upstream DNS server. and cache which
provides a caching layer to improve
performance. Okay, now let's talk about
customizing core DNS. By default, it
knows how to find any service we create.
But what if our pods need to talk to a
server on a private corporate network?
Let's say we have an internal domain
like uh my.com that can only be resolved
by our company's private DNS server.
We're going to customize core DNS to
teach it how to resolve these private
addresses all without disrupting its
normal cluster duties. So the first step
is to inspect the current DNS
configuration. So before we change
anything, let's look at the default
configuration. Core DNS is configured
via a config map located in the cube
system name space and we can edit it
directly. So we have the config map and
this is a live config map in the
cluster. So we'll see a key called core
file. This is the main configuration. So
notice this block the col53.
The dot means the block is the default
for any query. Inside you'll see a
forward plugin pointing to the
etc/resolve.comp.
This is the default behavior. If core
DNS can't resolve a name without the
cluster like google.com, it forwards the
request to the same upstream DNS servers
that the node itself uses. You'll also
see the reload plugin, which is the line
right here. This is important. It means
cordiness watches this file for changes
and will automatically apply them
without needing a restart. It's what
allows us to do this live edit safely.
So, we're going to add a custom forward
for forwarding rule. We're going to add
a new specific server block. This block
will only handle queries for our
internal domain, which is going to be uh
myc.com. So, let's go down past this
curly brace right here, right before
kind. And I have to press I to go to
insert mode. And now I'm going to add a
new block for our internal domain. Okay.
So we have the domain 53 errors and we
have errors cast 30 and then the forward
where it's going to be forwarding to. So
basically the my corp 53 defines a new
DNS zone. U core DNS now knows that any
query ending in my corp.com should be
handled by this block specifically. CDN
DNS always picks the most specific
matching block. So this will be used
before the default dot block for these
queries. Where it says errors, that just
tells it to log any errors to standard
output. The cache 30, we're telling it
to uh cache responses for 30 seconds to
reduce load on our internal server. And
then the forward line is the key part.
It tells core DNS to forward any query
it receives in this block to our private
DNS server, which we are saying is at
the IP address 10.10.0.53.
So let's save this. So I'll hit escape
and then colon wq. Okay. Now let's
verify the custom rule works. So the
final which is the final most important
step. We need to test the nest
resolution from inside a pod. So let's
run a temporary pod with some networking
tools. So I'll just run the temporary
pod with this. I'll use a busy box image
and use and get an interactive shell.
So, we'll use this nsookup command to
query for a fake server on our corporate
domain. And even though the server
doesn't exist, okay, there it goes. So,
even though the server doesn't exist, it
should return a response from our fake
internal DNS.
While many containerized applications
are stateless, stateful applications
like databases require storage that
persists beyond the life cycle of a
single pod. Kubernetes provides a
powerful and abstract storage framework
built around persistent volumes,
persistent volume claims, and storage
classes. It's important to distinguish
between the different volume concepts in
Kubernetes. A volume is a directory
containing data that is accessible to
the containers in a pod. The life cycle
of a volume is tied to the life cycle of
the pod that encloses it. When the pod
ceases to exist, the volume is destroyed
and its data is lost. This is suitable
for ephemeral data. A persistent volume
or PV is a piece of storage in the
cluster that has been provisioned by an
administrator or dynamically provisioned
using a storage class. It's a resource
in the cluster just like a CPU or
memory. The key feature of a PV is that
its life cycle is independent of any
individual pod that uses it. When a pod
is deleted, the data in the PV persists.
A persistent volume claim or PVC is a
request for storage by a user. A
developer creates a PVC specifying the
required size and access mode without
needing to know the details of the
underlying storage infrastructure. The
PVC acts as a claim on a PV resource.
When a user creates a PVC, the
Kubernetes control plane looks for a PV
that can satisfy the claims
requirements. If a suitable available PV
is found, the control plane binds the
PVC to that PV. This is a onetoone
mapping. Once bound, no other PVC can
claim that PV. A pod can then request
the storage by referencing the PVC in
its volume definition. When defining PVs
and PVCs, two of the most important
specifications are the access mode and
the reclaim policy. Access modes define
how a volume can be mounted by nodes in
the cluster. The chosen access mode must
be supported by the underlying storage
provider. The primary access modes are
read write once or RWO which means the
volume can be mounted as read write by a
single node. This is the most common
access mode and is supported by most
volume types. Read only mini or ROX
which means the volume can be mounted as
read only by many nodes simultaneously.
read write mini or RWX which means the
volume can be mounted as read write by
many nodes simultaneously. This is
supported by network file systems like
NFS or SFS and read write once pod or
RWOP which is a newer model that
restricts volume access to a single pod.
This is the most restrictive and secure
option. The reclaim policy of a
persistent volume tells the cluster what
to do with the volume after its bound
persistent volume claim has been
deleted. A retain policy means that when
the PVC is deleted, the PV remains. The
volume, its data, and its underlying
storage asset are not deleted. The
cluster administrator must manually
clean up the volume and its data. This
is the safest policy for production
data. A delete policy means that when
the PVC is deleted, the PV and the
associated external storage asset are
automatically deleted. This is often the
default for dynamically provisioned
volumes. A recycle policy performs a
basic scrub on the volume and makes it
available again for a new claim. This
policy is no longer recommended due to
security concerns and has been replaced
by dynamic provisioning. Okay.
Kubernetes storage. We're going to start
with the foundational manual method
called static provisioning which is a
great way to understand the building
blocks of how Kubernetes handles
persistent data. So in this example, I'm
going to play two roles. The first I'll
be the cluster administrator who is
responsible for creating the available
storage. Then I'll switch hats and
become the application developer who
needs to request and use the storage. So
the admin's job with the admin's hat on,
my first job is to make some storage
available to the cluster. So I'll define
a persistent volume or PV in a YAML
file. So nanopv.yaml.
So let's break this down. For the
capacity, I'm making 5 GB of storage.
Then the access mode is readwrite once
which means that the volume can only be
mounted for reading and writing by a
single node at a time. And then the
storage class name is manual which means
we're using uh which basically is a
custom name I've created which is like a
label. It's how developers will find and
request this specific type of storage.
And then the host path is simply maps to
a directory on the nodes file system.
But be careful. This is great for local
demos, but you would never use this in
production because the data is tied to a
single node. So, let's apply this. I'm
going to save this
and then we'll apply the file to create
a PV. Now, let's see what we've done.
So, we'll do cube control get pv. Okay.
So, we can see right there the status is
available. It's like a reserve parking
spot, empty and waiting for a car to
claim it. So, let's go to step two,
which uh basically I'm switching hats.
I'm a developer who needs to store data
for my application. I don't need to know
about the underlying storage. I just
need to make a request. This request is
a persistent volume claim or PVC. So,
I'll do nano pvc.yaml.
So, this is what I want. I'm requesting
storage with the storage class name
manual. So this tells Kubernetes to find
a PV with that same class name. And then
I'm also requesting a readwrite once
access which must match the PV. I'm
asking for 2 gigabytes. Kubernetes will
find the smallest available PV that can
satisfy the request and our 5 GB volume
is a perfect match. So I'll save that
and then I will apply it. And now we can
list both our PV and PVC's at the same
time. Um, whips with a comma. And let me
zoom out a little bit. Okay, now we can
see it all on one screen here. So we can
now see the status of this is bound. The
developer's claim has been successfully
matched with the administrators volume.
Kubernetes will now hold this PV for our
PVC until we release it. So now let's
talk about using the PVC in a pod. The
final step is to actually use the
storage in an application. So we'll
create a pod that references our PVC. So
we'll start with creating a YAML file
pod storage.yaml. And then under
volumes, we're defining our a volume for
our pod named my storage. and we're
telling it to get its storage from the
persistent volume claim named task pv
claim. Then in the volume mounts
section, we mount that volume into our
engineext container at this path here
which is the web route. So we'll save
that and then we will apply. Okay,
that's it. Our EngineX pod is now
running and any files it writes to its
website directory will actually be saved
to the /mount/data on our host node. The
data is now persistent and will survive
even if this pod is deleted and
recreated.
Manually creating PVs is inflexible and
doesn't scale well. Dynamic provisioning
automates the creation of PVs. Instead
of pre-provisioning PVs, an
administrator defines one or more
storage class objects. A storage class
provides a way for administrators to
describe the classes of storage they
offer. Each storage class specifies a
provisioner which knows how to create
the storage and parameters specific to
that provisioner. When a user creates a
PVC that specifies a storage class name,
the corresponding provisioner is
triggered to automatically create a
matching PV and bind it to the PVC.
Dynamic provisioning with storage
classes. That static method was a lot of
work for the admin. Now let's look at
the modern automated way. Dynamic
provisioning. Here the admin just sets
up a template and storage is created on
demand. So let's inspect the storage
class. The template for creating storage
is called a storage class. Most
Kubernetes environments come with a
default one already set up. So let's see
what we have with get storage class.
Okay, none are found. But don't worry
that none is found. This is completely
normal and expected for a cluster you've
built yourself with cube ADM. Cloud
providers like Google Cloud or AWS
automatically provide a default storage
class that's that's linked to their
block storage services. But our local
cluster doesn't have one because
Kubernetes has no idea what kind of
storage hardware we have available. So
we need to install one ourselves. For a
local lab environment like ours, the
easiest solution is to install a host
path provisioner. This will create a
storage class that provisions storage by
simply creating directories on our
worker nodes local disk. But before we
install it, it's important to understand
that this hostpad path method is
fantastic for learning and development,
but it should never be used in a real
production environment. It ties all of
our data to the disk of a single node,
which is not durable or highly
available. So with that invi in mind,
we're going to install the rancher local
path provisioner. So this command that I
have here will download its manifest and
create all the necessary components in
our cluster. Once that's installed, we
can run our git storage command. And we
can see that there is now a storage
command or a storage class here. So our
cluster now has a way to automatically
provide storage. So let's see this in
action. This is the magic of dynamic
provisioning. As an application
developer, I don't need to ask an admin
to create storage for me anymore. I can
just request it by creating a persistent
volume plane or PVC. So I'm going to
create a file named
my PVC.yaml
to define our storage request. So we can
see we're going to be using the storage
class we just created local path and
this volume can be mounted by a single
node and we're requesting one gigabyte.
So let me save that and then we will
apply it. So we'll do cubec controller
get PVC. We can see this claim is
pending and basically that's what we
want to see. It's waiting the storage
provisioner is waiting for a pod that
actually uses this PVC to be created
before it binds.
Troubleshooting is the most heavily
weighted domain in the CKA exam,
reflecting its importance in the
day-to-day work of a Kubernetes
administrator. A systematic and logical
approach is key to efficiently
diagnosing and resolving issues in a
complex distributed system like
Kubernetes. A chaotic approach to
troubleshooting leads to wasted time and
potential misdiagnosis.
A structured methodology is essential
especially in a timed exam environment.
The recommended approach involves five
steps. First, identify the problem.
Clearly define what is not working. Is a
pod crashing? Is a service unreachable?
Is the cluster unresponsive? Start with
a highle check like cube controller get
pods. Second, gather information.
collect logs, events, and resource
definitions to understand the context of
the failure. The cube controller
describe command is one of the most
powerful tools for this step. Third,
analyze the data. Examine the collected
information to form a hypothesis about
the root cause. Look for error messages,
status conditions, and relevant events.
Fourth, implement a solution. Apply a
fix based on your hypothesis. This might
involve editing a YAML manifest,
correcting a command, or restarting a
component. And fifth, verify the
solution. Confirm that the fix has
resolved the issue and has not
introduced any new problems. When
troubleshooting, it's often effective to
work from the application layer down to
the infrastructure layer. Pod, service,
node, cluster components.
Pod failures are the most common issues
an administrator will face. Pods can
fail to start or crash during runtime
for many reasons. The status of a pod
provides the first clue to what might be
wrong. A pending status means the pod
has been accepted by the cluster, but
one or more of its containers has not
been created yet. This could be because
it's waiting to be scheduled or is
downloading images. Container creating
means the pod has been scheduled to a
node but the container runtime is in the
process of starting a container. Image
pull back off or error image pull means
the cublet was an unable to pull the
container image from the registry. Crash
loop back off means a container in the
pod started but then executed with an
error. The cublet is repeatedly trying
to restart it but it keeps crashing. An
error status means the pod has failed
and the phase is not succeeded and om
killed means the container was
terminated because it exceeded its
memory limit. The most common reason for
a pod to be stuck in pending is a
scheduling failure. This can be due to
insufficient resources, failing node
affinity anti-affffinity rules, the node
being tainted and the pod lacking a
toleration or an unbound persistent
volume claim. The cube controller
describe pod command is the most
important tool here. The event section
at the bottom will provide a clear
reason such as 0/3 nodes are available
three insufficient CPU. If the cause is
resource related, check node capacity
with cube controller describe node. The
cause is usually an incorrect image name
or tag in the pod manifest, an error
authenticating with a private registry,
or the registry being unreachable. Your
best debug step here is to again use
cubecontroller describe pod. The events
will show a failed event with the
message failed to pull image and a
specific error. This is often the most
complex issue as it indicates a problem
within the application or its
configuration. The cause is likely an
error in the application code or a
misconfiguration, a failing liveness
probe or incorrect file permissions. The
most critical step here is to check the
logs. The logs will almost always
contain the error message or stack trace
that reveals the root cause. You can
also check the pod description to look
for clues and the container's exit code.
If the container starts but crashes too
quickly to get logs, you may need to
modify its command to keep it alive for
debugging. For example, change the
command to sleep 3600 and then use
cubecontroller exec to get a shell
inside.
Kubernetes provides another mechanism
for containers to report fatal events.
Termination messages. A container can
write a brief message to a file and
Kubernetes will surface this message in
the last state.
The container status which is visible in
the output of cube control describe pod.
This can be useful for providing a
concise summary of a failure when full
logs are too verbose.
If applications are failing clusterwide,
the problem may lie with the nodes or
the control plane itself. Nodes can be
in several states. The most common
problematic states are not ready and
scheduling disabled. A not ready node
means the cublet on the node is not
reporting a healthy status to the
control plane. This could be because the
cublet process is not running. The node
has a network partition preventing it
from reaching the API server or the
underlying machine is down. Your first
debug step here is to SSH into the
affected node and check the status of
the cublet service. If it's not running,
try starting it. You can also examine
the cublet logs for errors. A scheduling
disabled node means the scheduler will
not place any new pods on it. The cause
is usually that an administrator
manually cordone the node often for
maintenance. The fix is to use the cube
controller uncordone command
on a cube ADM installed cluster. The
control plane components run as static
pods. Their YAML manifests are located
in etc/ubernetes/manifests
on the control plane node. The cublet on
that node is responsible for ensuring
these pods are running. API service
failure. If the API server is down, cube
controller commands will fail with a
connection refused error. To debug SSH
into the control plane node, check if
the cube API server container is running
using the container runtimes command
line interface. Check its logs. And
finally, inspect its manifest file for
syntax errors or incorrect parameters.
scheduler or controller manager failure.
Symptoms include new pods remaining
pending indefinitely in the case of a
scheduler failure or deployments not
creating new pods for a controller
manager failure. The process for
debugging is the same as for the API
server. SSH into the control plane node
and inspect the corresponding static pod
and its logs.
Service connectivity issues can be
complex. A systematic check is the best
approach. Assume you have a client pod
that cannot connect to a service. First,
check DNS resolution. From the client
pod, try to resolve the service name
with NS lookup. If this fails, the
problem is likely with core DNS. Second,
check the service and endpoints. Verify
that the service exists and that it has
selected the correct backend pods using
cubecontroller describe service. If the
endpoints list is empty, it means the
services selector does not match the
labels on any running pods. Correct the
labels on the pods or the selector in
the service. Third, check pod
connectivity. Try to connect directly to
a backend pod's IP address from the
client pod. If this fails, the issue is
at a lower level, possibly with the CNI
plugin or a network policy. And finally,
check network policies. If network
policies are in effect, they might be
blocking the traffic. Temporarily delete
any relevant policies to see if
connectivity is restored. If it is, the
policy needs to be adjusted to allow the
required traffic.
Understanding
resource consumption is important to
diagnosing performance issues and
scheduling failures. The cube control
top command which relies on the metric
server is the primary tool for this. You
can check node resource usage to get an
overview of the CPU and memory
utilization of each node. This helps
identify nodes that are under pressure,
which could explain why pods are being
throttled or evicted. You can also drill
down to see the resource usage of
individual pods. This is invaluable for
diagnosing OOM killed errors, for
example, by comparing usage to the pod's
memory limit and for tuning HPA and for
tuning HPA targets by observing typical
CPU usage under load.
This guide provides a comprehensive
hands-on pathway to preparing for the
certified Kubernetes administrator exam.
By progressing throughout each section
from foundational architecture to
advanced troubleshooting, candidates
will build not only the theoretical
knowledge, but also the critical command
line muscle memory required to succeed.
The core themes that emerge are the
importance of a declarative mindset, a
deep understanding of the cluster's
underlying components, and a systematic
approach to problem solving. The CKA is
not a test of memorization, but of
practical application. Success hinges on
the ability to quickly and accurately
diagnose issues within a live Kubernetes
environment, manipulate resources using
Cube controller and YAML, and manage the
entire cluster life cycle with tools
like CubeADM. By diligently working
through the demonstrations and labs
presented here, aspiring administrators
will be well equipped to tackle the
challenges of the CKA exam and more
importantly to effectively manage
production Kubernetes clusters in the
real world. Thanks for watching and good
luck on your certified Kubernetes
administrator exam."

life. And I think there's a couple
reasons for that. One, because you have
to have conviction in yourself. Two, I
would never want to work for a company
that look down on me advocating for
myself because the one thing I'm going
to do for the rest of my life is
advocate for myself cuz nobody else is
going to do it for me. That's number
two. And three, if you look at it from
just a financial perspective, a company
has put potentially six figure amount of
dollars behind recruiting you. That's
not going to go away because you
advocate for yourself. Well, they've
probably spent $50 to $75,000 just you.
And if you say, ""Hey, I have a competing
offer,"" which by the way is the best way
to have leverage. The answer to your
question, ""Do we still have leverage?""
is just being a desirable candidate,
having other opportunities, just go get
offers, get actual numbers, figure out
what people are making, and then come to
the table with, ""Hey, I love your
company. I'd love to work here, but, you
know, let's be honest, I need it to be
worth my time."" Um, you know, to set me
up for success. And you know, also I
don't want to come into work every day
and worry about, oh my god, I'm not
making enough. That's just going to make
me a bad employee."

do to demonstrate that you have that

And they want people, especially in this
market, that can hit the ground running

things we've always rebelled against is
nobody wants to hire the aspiring.
Nobody wants to hire the even entry
level at this point. They want someone
that can get to work immediately. And if
you're not projecting that in everything
that you do as part of your application
process, you're getting left to the
wayside by somebody else that can
package their experience in a way that
makes sense in the context of that job.
And now that can happen in a lot of
different ways, like of course better
resume, better LinkedIn, all the stuff
that just has to be buttoned up or else
you're just competing against the horde
with no no armor. But there's also
referrals. How do I use other folks in
my network to put a stamp on my
experience so that someone can more
implicitly trust that I'm able to do the
things that I say I can You."
