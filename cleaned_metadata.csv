with it in this course you will learn how to build real ai powered features like the ones you see in apps from google amazon and beyond well start by building a solid foundation understanding language models tokens context windows choosing the right models model settings and prompt engineering then well build projects starting with a chatbot that can answer questions about an imaginary theme park helping visitors find what they need faster next well create a tool that analyzes customer feedback and delivers clear actionable insights so users can make shorter decisions in seconds and finally well wrap up with powerful opensource integrations you can run anywhere along the way you will learn clean architecture principles follow best practices and work with modern tools like bun tailwind shatsen prisma and olama by the end you will have the skills and confidence to build ai powered apps people actually want to use im mash hamadani a software engineer with over 20 years of experience and ive taught millions how to code and become professional software engineers through my youtube channel and online school codewithmarshcom if youre new here make sure to subscribe as i upload new videos all the time now lets jump in and get started before we dive in lets talk about what youll need to know to get the most out of this course the ideal student is someone who already knows the basics of frontend development and wants to bring ai into their applications to make them more engaging and smarter that means you should be comfortable with modern javascript and typescript things like arrow functions destructuring promises and async and await you should also know how to build simple react applications you should know how to create components work with jsx and use the state and effect hooks just the basics you dont need to be a react expert if you know a bit of backend development and databases thats great but not required the same goes with ai you dont need any prior experience i will walk you through everything step by step if that sounds like you youre ready to get started music assuming that youre the right student for this course let me give you a quick overview of how its structured and what to expect first let me tell you what this course is not if youre looking for one of those build an app with ai in 1 hour miracles you know where you paste a few prompts into chat gpt sit back with the latte and poof your billion dollar startup is ready this isnt that course we are not doing vip coding here were building smart features with ai the kind that actually make your apps more useful and more engaging and well do it the right way so you understand exactly whats going on under the hood all right heres how the course is laid out in section one well start with the foundations youll learn what language models are what they can do and how to work with them well talk about tokens context windows model settings like temperature and how to call models this section sets you up with the concepts you need before we dive into building section two is all about setting up a modern full stack project from scratch now we could use nexjs js here but i decided not to because not everybody uses it or even likes it and some developers prefer to keep the front end and back end completely separate so in this course well keep the back end and front end completely separate this helps you clearly see how the two parts talk to each other well use a modern stack with bun express react tailwind and chaten and dont worry if you havent used these tools before ill teach you everything from scratch now if you prefer nexjs js you can still apply everything you learn in this course to a nextjs project the principles are exactly the same section 3 is our first big project a chatbot that can answer questions about an imaginary theme park to help visitors find the information they need faster well start with the back end build it step by step and then refactor it using clean architecture principles once the back end is solid well build the front end the same way well add features improve the ui and make the chatbot better with each lesson this is where i want you to code along with me dont just watch understand the code the problems we run into and why we solve them the way we do if it feels like im going too fast just watch one lesson at a time take notes and then repeat it the lessons are short and focused so you wont need to remember a lot at once in section four well dive into prompt engineering the art of writing prompts that actually get the results you want you will learn how to give context control output format use examples handle errors and reduce hallucinations section five is another full stack project this time a product review summarizer you have probably seen this on a lot of websites a quick summary of reviews so you can decide faster well build our own version from scratch complete with a database and prisma migrations its a bigger more complex project than the chatbot so well get to explore a lot of techniques and best practices that most courses skip and heres the cool part what you learn here isnt just for summarizing text you can apply the same techniques to build all kinds of ai powered features finally section six is about working with opensource models youll learn why they matter how to find them how to run them locally and how to integrate them into our applications this opens up a whole new world where youre not tied to commercial apis now throughout the course ill share tips tricks and shortcuts you dont want to miss thats why its important to watch every lesson in order and code along especially during the projects this is a handson course and you will get the most out of it by being active from the very beginning oh and by the way what youre watching here on youtube is actually the first two hours of my full 7hour course im giving you this part for free so you can get a feel for my teaching style and see if you want to go deeper next were going to set up our development environment music before we dive into coding lets quickly set up our development environment first make sure you have the latest version of node on your machine so open up a terminal window and run nodev look on this machine im running node version 2217 so make sure you have the same version or higher if not head over to nodejsorg and download the latest version now for coding well be using vs code youre welcome to use your preferred editor but i highly encourage you to use vs code because throughout the course im going to show you a lot of cool shortcuts and useful plugins that not only help you write code faster they also make your job more fun and enjoyable so thats all you need for now nodejs and vs code well install any other tools as we go through the course all right with your environment ready now lets get started music welcome back in this section well lay the foundation for everything well build in this course well explore what language models are what we can do with them and how to use them effectively in real world applications well also cover practical concepts like tokens cost model selection and key settings that shape the models behavior even if you have used chat jp before this section will give you a solid mental model so when we start building youll know exactly how and why things work the way they do now lets jump in and get started since chat jpt came out the software world has changed fast new models are being released every month new tools new apis new expectations and new job titles one of the most exciting ones is ai engineer you have probably seen it pop up in job postings but what exactly is that well its not the same as a machine learning engineer machine learning engineers build and train models they clean data tune architectures and optimize training pipelines its mathheavy and research focused ai engineers on the other hand use pretrained models especially large language models to build smarter applications they dont need to understand the math behind the model they need to understand how to use it and how to integrate it into real world apps its a lot like using a database as a software engineer you dont need to know how mysql works internally you just need to know how to query it structure your data and build a reliable product in the same way as an ai engineer your job is to understand how to use these powerful ai models to solve real problems right now companies around the world are hiring engineers who know how to build ai powered features things like summarization translation intelligent search automation and personalized ux let me show you just a few examples amazon now shows an ai generated summary of product reviews on the product page this saves shoppers time and increases conversion by making the buying decision faster youll see the same pattern in many other applications where ai is being used to surface quick takeaways from long threads as another example active campaign which is a marketing platform lets marketers use ai to generate full email campaigns with just a few prompts instead of starting from scratch they get instant draft content they can publish and send heres another example on twitter or x if you see a post in another language youll often see a translate link behind the scenes a large language model detects the language determines your local and generates a translated version instantly this feature is becoming standard across social platforms and news applications heres another example platforms like youtube and twitch use ai to automatically flag things like spam hate speech or inappropriate content it helps keep communities safe without needing thousands of human moderators watching everything in real time heres another example freshesk which is a customer support platform uses ai to automatically categorize prioritize and route incoming support tickets so instead of agents manually sorting through every request the system sends each ticket to the right team and that means agents spend less time organizing and more time solving lets look at another example on redfin which is a platform for finding homes when we are viewing a property listing theres a builtin chat assistant that can answer questions about that specific property so instead of waiting to talk to an agent users can get the basic info they need right away and these are just a few examples the possibilities are endless everyday developers are adding smart features like these into their applications not just for novelty but to save time reduce costs and build smarter more helpful experiences i believe that going forward every software engineer will be expected to know how to work with ai models just like were expected to work with databases today you will need to know about large language models or llms prompt engineering retrieval augmented generation or rag vector databases building agents and so on this course is your first step into that world so if youre a developer and you want to keep up with where the industry is headed youre in the right place in the next lesson well break down what a large language model actually is in simple practical terms now that you understand why learning ai matters lets start unpacking the fundamentals in this lesson were going to answer a basic but important question what is a large language model lets break it down at its core a language model is a system thats trained to understand and generate human language there are several language models available today some are commercial like gpt by openai gemini by google claude by anthropic grock by xai which is elon musks company we also have open source models like llama by meta mistral by european company also named mistl and many many more theyre called large because theyre trained on massive amounts of text everything from books and articles to forums code documentation and more through this training they learn statistical patterns in a language things like grammar sentence structure tone common facts and phrasing so when we prompt an llm with lets say the capital of france is it doesnt look up the answer it simply predicts what a helpful response should look like based on patterns it has seen during training its like autocomplete but on steroids in practice a large language model is a giant mathematical structure usually multiple gigabytes in size made up of billions of parameters those parameters represent patterns in language like grammar facts tone and style these models dont understand language the way we do they dont have beliefs or intelligence theyre just very good at predicting what comes next the output is often so well written so fluent on structure that it feels like theres intelligence behind the scenes but there isnt its just mass and probability based entirely on training data thats why if you ask chat gpt the same question multiple times well often get slightly different answers its not repeating a stored response its generating new output each time based on likelihood not truth and that brings us to a very important point because these models dont understand what theyre saying the quality of training data is everything if a model is trained unbiased inaccurate or lowquality data its responses will reflect that thats why some models appear politically biased or why some models give completely false answers with total certainty it all comes back to the data these days many people use language models to generate code and its impressive at first but heres the issue these models are trained on billions of lines of code from public repositories including github and a huge portion of that code is poorly written outdated filled with antiatterns or just broken the model doesnt know that it simply learns whats common not necessarily whats correct or maintainable so when it generates code it might look clean sound confident even compile but it could be buggy insecure or full of bad practices thats the danger of blindly trusting model generated code we get something that looks professional but isnt always reliable so once again i want to emphasize that training matters a lot a model is only as good as the data its trained on garbage in garbage out if it learns from clean highquality code and accurate language data it performs well if it trains on messy biased or incorrect data the responses can be misleading or flatout wrong now training a large model from scratch isnt just about data it also requires enormous amounts of compute power were talking thousands of gpus weeks or months of continuous training and infrastructure that only a handful of companies in the world can afford thats why most of us dont train models ourselves as developers our job isnt to become machine learning engineers its to understand how to talk to these models via prompting how to handle their limitations and how to integrate them into our applications to build smarter features just like we dont need to build our own database engine we just need to know how to use one thats the mindset you will develop throughout this course in the next few lessons well dig deeper into how these models work things like tokens cost and how to pick the right one for the job so i told you that as a developer you need to learn how to integrate language models into your applications now let me show you what that actually looks like think about a typical application structure we have a front end maybe built with react or something similar a back end a database for storing our application data and now a language model ready to generate or process content the llm is usually not the center of our application its a supporting system we send it input or a prompt we get a response and use that response to enhance the user experience and the way we use it depends on our feature for example a very common use case is summarization i showed you how amazon uses that to summarize reviews this is getting very common in modern applications we can also use llms for generating content like emails product descriptions social media posts and so on another common use case is text classification we can use a model to categorize input for example is this spam or not is this review positive or negative is this support ticket about billing login or cancellation we can ask llms to generate responses as json objects like this that means our back end can easily parse the response store it and make decisions based on it we can also use llms for translating text from one language to another i showed you how twitter or x does this also the new ios does that to translate texts in real time another great application of language models is in extracting information for example we can give an llm some messy text like a pdf and ask it to pull out structured data like invoice number amount names addresses and so on we can also use llms to build and integrate chat bots into our applications we can build chat bots that answer questions based on user data or business documents and so on all of these use cases follow the same pattern text in text out we give the model a prompt and it gives us back a response the response can be plain text it can be an array a json object a number an image or whatever is useful now that you have seen what llms can do lets look at whats actually inside them in the next lesson well talk about how these models work under the hood music now that you know what language models are and what we can do with them lets take a closer look at something that plays a big role in how we use them effectively and thats tokens what are tokens well when we send a prompt to a language model it doesnt process the input as plain text instead it breaks the text down into smaller units called tokens these tokens can be whole words parts of words punctuation even emojis or spaces so tokens arent the same as characters or words they fall somewhere in between to see this in action here on google search for openai tokenizer on this page you can type a prompt here or click show example look this piece of text has 252 characters and its broken down into 53 tokens down below you can see these tokens colorcoded so each piece represents a token now why does this matter because tokens directly impact cost lets take open as an example at the time of this recording generating 1 million output tokens with gpt40 mini costs 60 with gpt41 the same task would cost 8 thats 13 times more so if youre summarizing long documents or generating large amounts of content token usage and therefore cost can add up quickly thats why when choosing a model cost should be one of the key factors we shouldnt just go for the latest or most powerful model think about what your app actually needs its kind of like buying a phone you dont always need the latest iphone pro max sometimes a midrange phone gives you everything you need same logic applies here so tokens cost money but theres also a limit to how many tokens a model can handle at once that limit is called the context window the context window includes our prompt which is the input the models response and the chat history thats if were building a conversational experience again all of this is measured in tokens for example gpt4 mini has a context window of about 128000 tokens gpt 41 can handle around 1 million tokens mistrol which is an opensource model supports around 32000 tokens so if we send a very long prompt and hit the token limit or the context window the model will stop even in the middle of a sentence thats why its important to know how much context our model can handle but again we dont always need the largest context window or the biggest model mistrol for example might be perfectly sufficient for tasks like summarizing a blog post or classifying a support ticket it all depends on the needs of our application in the next lesson im going to show you how to count tokens programmatically so we can estimate cost and stay within limits before sending a request music all right now let me show you how to count tokens in code so open up a terminal window lets go to our desktop or somewhere on your machine and create a directory called playground this is going to be our playground project next we cd into this directory and run npm inity to create a packagejson file without answering basic questions about our project like its name version and so on so heres our packagejson file great now were going to install a library called tick token this is the tokenizer used by open ai models so different ai models different platforms have their own tokenizer library okay good now to open this in vs code were on code space period now if this doesnt work on your machine just drag and drop this directory onto vs code all right now we add a new file here indexjs js on the top we import a function called get encoding from tick token next we call get encoding and give it an argument the argument is an encoding here we have a few options these options or these encodings are dictionaries that map token ids to the actual tokens for example we might have a token id lets say 9004 that maps to the word hello okay so were going to pick cl 100k underline base that is short for chat language and 100k means in this dictionary we have about 100000 unique tokens so we get an encoding and store it in a constant next we call encoding encode and give it a piece of text like hello world this is the first test of tick token library okay next we get our tokens and store them in a constant and finally we log them on the console okay now lets open up a terminal window here by pressing control and backtick now lets run our application by running node indexjs all right we got a syntax error saying cannot use import statement outside a module why are we getting this because by default node interprets our javascript files as common js modules in common js modules we have a different format for importing functions so instead of this syntax which is called es module syntax we have a different syntax which is called commonjs syntax so we have to write code like const get encoding equals require t take token that is the common js format which is older nobody uses that anymore so to tell nodejs to use the new format we have to go to our package json file we can open it right here packagejson json we set the type property to module okay now back to the terminal lets rerun indexjs all right look we got an array of 13 items where each item is a number each number is a token id that maps to an actual token so when working with large amount of text we can use the tick token library to count tokens before sending a prompt to a language model hey just a quick reminder as i told you at the beginning of this video what youre watching right now is actually the first 2 hours of my full 7hour course on building ai powered apps so once you finish this tutorial if you want to learn more check out the link in the description to enroll in the complete course i would love to see you inside music these days there are hundreds of ai models out there and new ones are released almost every week so which model should we choose there is no single right answer the model we choose really depends on our application and its requirements in this lesson im going to give you a framework to make that decision now im not going to give you a fixed list of model names to choose because model names change quickly so instead were going to focus on the criteria that matter when choosing a model the first question we need to ask is how smart does the model have to be if we want to solve complex problems we want a model with stronger reasoning but if we just need to extract text classify a review or summarize a short paragraph we dont need the top tier model a smaller model is good enough to do the job the next question is how fast do we need a response bigger models are often slower especially when generating long outputs if youre building a realtime user experience like autocomplete quick summaries or short form answers well want a faster model the next question is what kinds of input and output are we going to send to and receive from a model text is the most common but newer models can also process images audio video or even a combination of those these are called large multimodal models or lmms so if our application involves anything beyond text for example describing whats in an image then we need a multimodal model the other factor is cost and i told you that this is based on the number of tokens so if youre processing long documents or generating a lot of content cost can add up quickly the next factor is the context window we talked about this before thats how much text the model can process at once and that includes our input the models response and the chat history if youre building a conversational experience if youre summarizing long documents analyzing code bases or having long back and forth conversations we need a model with a large context window the other factor is privacy if our application is processing sensitive data like patients medical records we probably dont want to send that data to openai servers this is where opensource selfhosted models can help well talk about that later in the course now to see this in action on google search for openai models on this page we can see the featured models at the time of this video we have gpt41 o4 mini and 03 now up here we can click compare models and compare these three models or any other models youre interested in now look 03 is their most powerful reasoning model you can see that indicated down here but this is also the slowest of all three models so there is no best single model if youre building an application that requires solving complex problems then we need a model with strong reasoning capability but otherwise if all we want to do is lets say summarize documents or extract structured data we can go with a simpler model now all these three models as you can see are multimodel models because they support text and image as the input but for the output they can only generate text so if you need to generate images in our application then we have to pick a different model at the time of this video we have a model called gpt image one now this model can support text and image as the input but it can only generate images in the output so it cannot generate any text now that aside down below you can see the pricing we have different prices for input and output so if we need to process large documents like contracts cost can add up pretty quickly so always compare the cost of models and go with the one that fits your application now moving on below that we have the context window of these models so this model has the context window of 200000 token this other model has a context window of about 1 million tokens now we also have another factor here thats max output tokens thats the number of tokens that can be in one response so this model even though it has a larger context window it can process more text or longer conversations but each response can be a maximum of 32000 tokens in contrast with this model our responses can be three times larger the other factor we have here is the knowledge cutoff and thats when the training of these models stopped so sometimes you can find older models that dont have uptoate knowledge of the world but they could be perfect for your application so once again there is no best model all right were done with this lesson in the next lesson were going to talk about model settings and see how different parameters affect the output music in this lesson well take a look at the settings that control how a language model behaves so here on the openai website on the models page lets grab gpt 41 on this page you can see all the details about this model like its level of intelligence the speed the price of input and output tokens as well as the modalities we can also see the context window max output tokens and the knowledge cutoff date now up here we can try this in the playground first we have to log in all right heres the model playground now the first time you want to use this you have to add credit to your account so up here click the settings icon then go to the billing page on this page you can add your debit or credit card and add some credit to your account once you do that now lets go back to the playground so the model is gpt41 we can change this to any models now all these models have a few common settings were going to talk about in this lesson the first one is text format here we have three options we have text which is plain text as well as json object and json schema lets see the differences in action so im going to go with text and send a prompt like give me three benefits of exercising so this gives us a short answer in plain text we have all seen this before now lets see what happens if we change this to json object now we repeat the prompt and say give me three benefits of exercising but we also add as a json object now take a look the model generated a json object with this format so we have an object with a single property called benefits of exercising which is an array of strings now if the response is not colorcoded on your machine just click this icon with this you can toggle between plain text and json format okay so json is useful if you want to parse the response in our application but what if we expect a different type of json object so instead of having a property like benefits of exercising lets say we want to have a property like exercise which would be an object with another property called benefits this is where we can use a json schema so we change the format to json schema in this box we should define the shape of our json objects now this format is a little bit complicated so its easier to generate it using ai here we can describe the kind of json object we expect in the response for example we can say generate a json object like the following so we want to have an object in this object we want to have a property called exercise which would be an object itself now inside this object we want to have a property called benefits which would be an array so we give it an example and then have it create this schema for us all right look so heres the name of the schema exercise schema and here we have more details about this schema so this is an object with these properties in this object we have a property called exercise which is an object itself with these properties in this object we have a property called benefits which is an array heres a description saying a list of benefits associated with the exercise next we have information about the types of items in this object so each element or each item is a string and heres a description of each element next we have the validation properties like required so the benefits property is required and no additional properties are allowed of course we can always change this to fit our application so lets go with the schema save now we repeat the last prompt and say give me three benefits of exercising as a json object all right take a look this time the model generated a different kind of json object so we have this object with a property called exercise which is an object with a property called benefits which is an array of strings so thats text format now lets go back to plain text then we have temperature with this we can control how random or creative the response can be this is a value between 0 and 2 but we never set it to extreme values heres a guideline we use a low temperature like 2 to4 for logical precise answers like summarization answering factual questions and so on we use higher temperature like a value between 7 to 10 zero for creative expressive tasks like brainstorming writing marketing copy and so on so its best to stick to this range dont go with extreme values like zero or two because the model can go crazy let me show you an example so here we have set the temperature to two now lets say write a story about a robot look what happens the model starts generating a story about a robot but as we progress look its generating gibberish there is nonsense coming out because the model is getting extremely creative this is the problem with really high temperatures so a good rule of thumb is to set it to 7 this is a good balance between logical and creative responses next we have max tokens and this sets the maximum length of the response now the value we set here really depends on what problem were trying to solve if you want to generate something short like a tweet we have to go with a lower value otherwise we may waste our tokens and pay more than we need but when using lower values keep in mind that the response can be cut off mids sentence let me show you so im going to set max tokens to 50 now once again were going to say write a story about a robot all right so it says in the quiet town of maplewood there was a small robot named pixel pixel was built by a kind inventor mrs rivera who wanted to help but look the sentence is cut off so to prevent this we have to be more precise with our prompt this is one of the prompt engineering techniques there are many more techniques well cover later in the course so here we can say write a story about a robot in 50 tokens or less write a complete answer without cutting off mid sentence all right now with this second story look its saying from that day on orbit became the twins favorite friend always helping those in need robot heart glowing with happiness beautiful so that was max tokens we also have top p this is another way to control randomness but it works a bit differently than temperature lets say as part of generating the response the current token is ant and here are all the possible options for the next word now next to each token you can see its probability based on the training data if we set top p to one we tell the model to use the full range of possibilities so any of these words or any of these tokens can be used to generate the response but if we use a lower top p like3 that makes the model focus only on the most likely next words so once again top is another way to control randomness it works differently from temperature in practice we usually change one or the other but not both if youre not sure which one to use stick with temperature and set top p to one so these are all the common settings we also have store logs which is used for logging and debugging by default its enabled which means all our prompts will be logged on openais servers to see them we go to the dashboard then we go to the logs on this page you can see all the prompts we have sent to openai we have the input the output the model and the date time if we click any of these items we can see more details so up here we can click details we can see the exact day time as well as the id of the response so each response has a unique identifier and this is useful for creating the conversation state so the model remembers our previous responses well talk about this later in the course we can also see the model that was used the number of tokens the response format max output tokens temperature and so on all right now let me show you how we can call models in code to do that first you have to create an api key so on the top lets go to the settings page then we go to api keys and create a new secret key we give it a name this could be the name of our application like my playground app next we assign it to a project we have the default project but we can also create multiple projects and assign different keys to different projects now lets create the key good lets copy this back to vs code we remove all the code here and declare a constant called openai api key reset it to this key now i got to emphasize this is just for demonstration in a real application we should never store api keys in the source code because with that anyone who has access to your source code can use your api key and youll be the one paying for it so as a best practice we should always store the keys outside of our source code using environment variables well talk about that later when we start building projects next we should install the openai library so we open a terminal window and run npm install open ai all right good now this library is just a wrapper around open aai api so it gives us a class with a bunch of methods that we use behind the scene its going to make http calls to the api exposed by openai if you go to the docs and look at the libraries page you can see that they also have official libraries or sdks for javascript python net java and go there are also a bunch of libraries built and maintained by community for other languages so back to the code on the top first we import the openai class from the openai module next we create an instance of this class so we declare a constant called client because this is a client to open aai platform we set it to a new instance of open aai and provide an object and here we set api key to open aai api key next we call client responsescreate and give it an object here we can set the model to lets say gpt41 we set the input to our prompt like write a story about a robot we can also set the other settings we talked about in the previous lesson like temperature lets set it to 7 and we set max output tokens to lets say 50 now this method returns an api promise so we have to await it to get the response so lets await this and get the response and finally we log the response on the console okay now back to the terminal lets run node indexjs now the terminal freezes because we are waiting for the response to be generated but later well enable streaming so you can see the response as its being generated okay now here we have a bunch of properties in the response the one we use most of the time is output text this is the response generated by the model but we also have a few other useful properties we have usage where we can see the number of input and output tokens now in this case im not entirely sure why input tokens is zero but output tokens is 50 we also have top p which is set to one by default we have temperature we have store so this response is logged on openai servers and also up here we have the unique identifier for this response later when we build a chatbot well use this to maintain a conversation state so the chatbot remembers the conversation history now back to the code lets see how we can enable streaming to do that first we set stream to true now to see this clearly lets increase max output tokens and set it to 250 now when we set stream to true we no longer get a response object instead we get a stream object so lets rename this by pressing f2 to stream now this stream is what we call an async iterable what does it mean well an iterable is an object that we can iterate over like an array so here we use a for loop and say for const event of stream so we are iterating over the stream getting one event at a time now i told you that this stream object is an async iterable so to iterate over it we have to use the await keyword because these events are generated at runtime so we dont get them all in one hit we get them as they are being produced okay so we iterate over the stream object and then log the event on the console now back to the terminal lets rerun our program all right now look were printing these event objects as we are receiving them lets scroll off and take a look at a few of them so look each event has a type property in this case the type is responseoutput textta this is the event that represents a chunk of text or a token being generated at runtime type each of these events has a sequence number so this is 252 next one is 253 here we have a delta property that is the token that is being generated so heres one token then we have another token so to print the response in the terminal as its being generated we just have to print the delta property so back to the code lets print eventta and rerun our program so these are the tokens that are being generated but the problem is at the beginning and at the end we get a bunch of undefined messages in the terminal the reason for that is because not all events contain the delta property the delta property only exists in events that contain a chunk of text being generated but we have other events that represent the beginning and the end of this operation so the proper way to do this is by checking if event delta is defined then we print it on the terminal so lets rerun our program okay were getting this tokens no more undefined messages beautiful but we dont want to print each token on a new line the reason this happens is because consolelog log always adds a new line character at the end so to print these tokens next to each other we have to take a different approach we have to call process std out which represents the standard output or the console window this object has a right method we call this and pass the delta now lets rerun our program okay this is the same experience we have when we use chat gpt so that brings us to the end of this section in the next section well start setting up a modern full stack project so i will see you in the next section welcome back before we start building we need to set up a clean modern full stack project one well use as the foundation for everything in this course now if you have done any research you have probably seen tons of templates and github starters for full stack applications and while some of them are great i decided not to use any of them i didnt want this course to depend on someone elses setup or introduce tools we havent covered also we will not be using nexjs in case you dont know its a powerful full stack framework built on top of react but not everybody likes it and it comes with its own learning curve i didnt want this to be a prerequisite for this course so instead well set everything up from scratch using tools like bun vit and express this gives us full control no hidden magic and a setup thats easy to understand and easy to scale along the way well add tailwind for styling set up sha cn ui for components format our code with prettier and automate our workflow with husky by the end of this section well have a solid full stack foundation thats lightweight clean and fully ours now lets jump in and get started before we start creating our project there is a tool i want to introduce that well use throughout the course and thats bun if you havent heard of it before bun is a modern javascript runtime kind of like nodejs but faster and more integrated with node we typically rely on multiple tools we use npm to install packages ts node to run typescript and something like nodemon to restart the server when we make changes with spun we get all of that in one tool its a runtime a package manager a taskr runner and even a typescript transpiler allin one so it can run typescript files out of the box and we dont need to install a bunch of extra tools just to get started now if youre more comfortable using node thats totally fine everything im going to show you can be done with node as well but if you follow along with bon you will probably find the experience cleaner and honestly a lot more enjoyable so head over to bondsh and here on the homepage find the installation instruction for your operating system just copy this command and run it in a terminal window now follow the instructions in the terminal so here on mac we have to execute this command execbinzsh now to verify that bon is installed properly we run bon version so on this machine im running bun version 1217 in the next lesson well talk about our project structure now to create our project structure we open a terminal window we go to somewhere on our machine im going to go to my desktop next we create a directory lets call it my app or whatever you want we cd into this directory and run bun in it this is the same as npm in it so it creates a packagejson json file as well as some additional files lets go ahead first we answer this question to select a project template we have blank react and library lets select blank so this created a few files we have a git ignore file a rule file for the cursor editor an index file a typescript configuration file and a readme file it also installed typescript so now lets open this with vs code so heres what we get we have a directory for the cursor editor im not using cursor so its safe to delete this we have our node modules directory a git ignore file a bond lock file an index file which is just a console lock statement our package json file just like a node project a readmi file and a typescript configuration file now to set up a full stack project were going to use something called a workspace which is a feature built into bun that lets us manage multiple sub projects like a client and a server application from a single place its also available in node projects so by convention we put our sub projects inside a directory called packages so here we add a directory called packages and then we add a subdirectory for our client app and one more for our server app next we go to our packagejson file and declare our workspaces so here we add a new property called workspaces and set it to an array of strings here we type the path to our sub packages so we go to the packages directory and grab the client directory and one more for the server directory now theres a shorthand syntax here we can replace client with an asterisk to say all directories under packages should be treated as workspaces so lets delete the second entry this is good so our project structure is ready over the next few lessons well create the client and server applications independently now i also want to initialize a git repository here so lets open a terminal window and run git in it good and make our first commit initial commit next well create our backend project now to create our server application here in the terminal we go to the packagesserver directory and run boninit one more time to create the sub project in this directory we select blank now back to our project here in the server directory we have the same files you saw in the previous lesson we dont need the cursor directory so lets get rid of it and clean up our project now back to the terminal next we shall install express as our web server in node projects we run npm install or npmi in bun projects we run bun at so with node projects we have two different tools node for running our code and npm for installing dependencies but in bun projects all these features are integrated into bun so we run bun at express okay we should also install express types for typescript as a development dependency to do that we run bun atd typesexpress good now back to our project look here in the server directory we have this packagejson file and in this file we have express as a dependency and also express types as a development dependency so in this project so far we have two separate packagejson files one in the root directory and one inside the server directory later when we create the client project well also have a packagejson file in our client directory okay now what is interesting about this structure is that in this setup we dont have different node modules in our server and client applications so we dont have a node modules directory inside the server directory we only have one at the top level where we have all the client and server dependencies so right now we have express as well as all its dependencies installed in this directory okay so we have installed express now lets create a basic web server so we go to the server directory and open indexts here on the top first we import the express function from the express module we call this function and get an object which we call app next we declare a constant called port we can initialize it from an environment variable to do that we use processnport so if we pass port as an environment variable we can pick it up here this is useful in production environments but otherwise if this environment variable is not defined we can give this a default value of 3000 next we define a route so here we call appget and give it two arguments a path like a forward slash which represents the root of our web server and a function that gets executed when we receive a request at this endpoint this function should have two arguments a request and a response here we use a lambda function and in this function we just want to send the hello world message to the client so we call response send and pass hello world okay now so far we have been writing plain javascript code there is no typescript here but we can annotate these arguments with types so on the top we can import the request and response types from the express module and then we can annotate these parameters with request and response okay so we have defined a route and a route handler next we should start our web server so we call applisten and give it two arguments a port and a callback function that gets executed when the web server is up and running so again we use a lambda function and here we can say consolelog now im going to replace single quotes with back tick so we can use template literal so here we can say server is running on http localhost port now here we use a template literal so we add a dollar sign and curly braces to insert port dynamically okay so thats pretty much it now to run this we go back to the terminal and here in the server directory we run bun run indexts okay our server is running so if you hold down command on mac or control on windows and click this it opens our web browser so our web server is set up properly beautiful now instead of running this command every time we can define a custom command like on start just like we do with node projects so lets stop this process by pressing control and c now we should go to our packagejson file here in vs code we can hold down command on mac or control on windows and press p to quickly find files if we type packagejson you can see we have two files one in the root directory and one in the server directory so here in the server packagejson we define our custom scripts so we add the scripts property heres our first script we call it start and set it to bun run indexts we also define a custom script called dev for running our application in watch mode so anytime we make changes to our files bun will automatically restart our web server we set this to bun run indexts just like before but here we use the watch option make sure to add this right after bun and before run okay now back in the terminal lets test our commands so first we run bun start because this is a builtin command okay our web server is running again lets verify it beautiful lets stop this and try the other command now dev is a custom command so we cannot run bundev instead we should run bun rundev now bun is watching our files so if we go to the index ts in the server directory and make a small change lets remove the exclamation mark this should restart our web server so if we go back to the browser and refresh the exclamation is gone earlier in the course i told you that we shouldnt store api keys in the source code for example here we dont want to declare a constant like api key and set it to whatever because with this anyone who has access to our source code can use this api key and well be the one paying for it so the right way to manage api keys is using environment variables thats what im going to show you in this lesson so lets go back to our terminal window and stop this process now if youre on a mac or linux you can use the export command if youre on windows you should use the set command with these commands we can set an environment variable which is a variable stored at the operating system level so we give it a name like open aai underline api underline key now by convention we use capital letters for environment variables so we set this to a value like 1 2 3 4 now back to indexts lets remove this line from here in this route handler i want to temporarily return our api key to do that we use the process object we go to env or and access open aai underline api underline key make sure to spell it properly now back to the terminal lets restart our application and go to the homepage refresh this verifies that we could successfully read the environment variable in our application beautiful but theres a problem with this approach with this approach every time we want to start our application first we have to set our environment variables and this is very tedious so this is where we use a library called env to streamline this process let me show you how to do that first we stop this process next here in the server package we install env oren next we go to our project and here in the server directory we add a new file called env now if you look at this git ignore file you can see that env files are by default excluded from our git repository so in the future when we push this repository to github the variables that we declare here will not be exposed to the public so this is for our private use here we can set open ai underline api underline key to lets use a different value like abcd to differentiate from the former value now to load this in our code we go to indexts on the top first we import object from env module then we call envconfig this should be the first line in our module what this does is it goes in this file it reads all the variables we have declared here and stores them as environment variables before running our application you will see that in a second so back to the terminal lets restart our application all right look env is injecting environment variables from our env file so back to the browser lets refresh but the value has not changed whats going on well the variable that we declared earlier in the terminal window overwrites the variables that we have declared in our env file to fix this issue we have to remove the environment variable we set earlier so lets stop this if youre on mac or linux use onset followed by the name of the environment variable like open ai underline api key if youre on windows use the set command and set the environment variable to an empty value okay now lets restart our application and refresh the homepage okay heres the updated value beautiful so now im going to replace this with my actual api key so back to our env file im going to replace abcd with a real api key beautiful now there is a problem here the problem is that if we commit our code to a git repository someone else cloning this has no idea what environment variables they should set so to help them here we duplicate this file and rename it to envexample example this file is not going to be excluded from our git repository so others can see what variables they should set in this file we keep the variable names but we remove the actual values now the last part back to indexts lets revert this code back and return hello world to the client so were done setting up our api key now the final step we make a commit and say manage open aai api key now one more thing before we finish this lesson if you make any changes in this env file you have to restart the application so bund will not detect the changes here which means you have to go to the terminal stop this process and restart the application so the new values are injected into the environment variables next were going to create our client project music now to create our front end application were going to use vit vit is a very popular build tool for frontend applications you have probably seen it before so here on vitdev lets go to get started on this page you can see the command for creating a new vit project so with npm we run npm create vit at latest we also have support for bun lets copy this command now back to vs code lets open a new terminal window so in this application were going to have two terminal windows open one for the server one for the client now we can rename this for clarity so im going to rename this to server and the second terminal window to client we can also color code them if you want change color lets make the server green and the client yellow is fine now lets go to the packagesclient directory paste that command but dont execute it yet because if you do so vit will create a subdirectory here which is not what we want so here we add a period which means create the front end application in the current directory lets go ahead first we select our framework which is going to be react next we select a variant were going to go with typescript okay now back to our project look here in the client directory we have a typical react project created with vit there is nothing magical here in this directory we also have a packagejson file so currently we have three package json files one at the root one for our server application and the other for the client application now back to the terminal the next step is to install dependencies using bun so we can run bon install or bon i this installs all the dependencies inside our top level node modules directory so once again were not going to have different node modules in client and server applications all right now that the dependencies are installed we can run our application by running bun rundev so dev is a custom script that is defined in our client packagejson file lets review that packagejson json in the client directory look so here we have these scripts dev build lint and so on so lets run our client application beautiful now lets make sure its working properly all right heres our react project lovely so lets wrap up this lesson by making a commit create the front end all right now to connect our client and server applications were going to go to our server application and define a new endpoint so we press command np on mac or control np on windows and go to indexts the one in the server directory now were going to grab this route handler and duplicate it now let me show you a cool shortcut on the top under the selection menu look we have this command copy line down the shortcut on mac is option shift and down so with this line selected if i hold down shift option and press down these few lines get duplicated now im going to change the path to apihello and instead of returning plain text i want to return a json object so lets pass an object and give it a property like message and set it to hello world now before going further lets test this so back to the browser here on our server application lets send a request to apihello okay this is our json object beautiful now if this is not pretty formatted on your machine just install this chrome extension json formatter now lets move on to the client part so were going to go to apptsx this is the container for our client application now were going to delete all the import statements we should also delete all the code inside this function but we are not going to manually select these lines im going to show you another cool shortcut so we put the cursor on the first line now on the top under the selection menu look at the shortcut for this command expand selection on mac its control shift command and right so with the cursor here im going to hold down shift control and command now if i press the right arrow the selection will expand if i press the left arrow the selection will shrink take a look so i press the right arrow now this word is selected i press the right arrow again now the entire line is selected lets keep going now the entire body of this function is selected but not the curly braces we can keep going now the braces are selected if we keep going the entire function definition is selected obviously thats not what we want so im still holding shift control and command with my left hand now if we press the left arrow we can shrink the selection and delete the code in this function now here were going to declare a state variable so we use the state hook initialize it to an empty string and call it message now were going to write a very basic react code to make an api call so we use the effect hook now i know some people are going to have a heart attack saying this but this is just for a quick demo there are better ways to make api calls well look at that later in the course so here we use the fetch function to send a request to apihello then when the promise is resolved we get the response we convert it to a json object and then we get the data and here we set the message to data message now as the second argument to the effect hook we pass an empty array as our dependencies so this code is executed only once this is just basic react stuff you should be familiar with this concept and finally we return a paragraph where we render our message now if you run our application this is going to fail because the api endpoint doesnt exist in our client application so if you go to our client application and send a request to apihello obviously its not going to work this is only available in our server application so to solve this issue were going to set up a proxy to automatically forward all requests starting with appi to our server application to do that we go to vitconfigts in this object we add a server property next we set proxy to an object and here we map requests from api to http localhost port 3000 and that means if you send a request to lets say apihello this will be automatically forwarded to localhost port 3000 apihello okay so with that in place lets test our application back to the browser lets go to our client application refresh there you go we have the hello world message but its displayed in the center of the screen which is not what we want so back to vs code lets go to indexcss and delete all these styles well come back and work on styling in the future so back to the browser all right looking good so lets wrap up this lesson by making a commit and here we say connect the front end and back end with our current setup every time we want to start this application we have to open two terminal windows one to start the server using one rundev and the other to start the client using the same command this is tedious so in this lesson im going to show you a simple way to start both applications using a single command first we stop the client and the server now we open a new terminal window make sure this is pointing to the root of the project here we install a dependency as a development dependency called concurrently make sure to spell it properly with this library we can start multiple applications using a single command to do this we go to indexts in the root directory now currently we have a console lock statement lets get rid of this instead we import the concurrently function from the concurrently module we call this function and give it an array of commands each command is for starting one application so heres one object here we should set a few properties the first one is name we set this to server next is command we set this to bun rundev this is the command that we run were starting our server application right next we set cwd or current working directory to packagesserver so we want to run this command from this directory now optionally we can assign a prefix color here because with this approach were going to have a single terminal window so to differentiate between client and server messages we can assign them different colors so for server we can use cyan now lets duplicate this again we put the cursor somewhere here hold down shift control command and press right to expand selection now the entire object is selected now lets duplicate it with shift option and down good now we add a comma here and make a few changes so this one is going to be client again we run our client application using the same command but from a different directory also lets change the color to green good so with this setup to start both applications we should run indexts from our root directory now to simplify things were going to go to the packagejson file in the root directory and define a custom script here so scripts we can define a dev script and set it to bun run indexts now back to the terminal so were in the root directory here we run bun rundev this started both applications you can see server messages are in cyan and client messages are in green lets make sure our setup is working so back to the browser lets refresh beautiful so with this we no longer need the server and client terminal windows lets clean things up and make a commit to wrap up this lesson run both apps together all right lets talk about styling our application to style our application were going to use tailwind css now if you havent used tailwind before its a utility first css framework which means it gives us a bunch of small descriptive css classes like flex pt4 which is short for padding top four text center and so on so we can use these classes in our markup to style our elements with this all the styling is here so we dont go back and forth between a css file and a css file now some people love this others not so much but in this course our focus isnt on styling its on building ai powered features so well keep styling to minimum and well use tailwind because its a very popular framework and if youre not familiar with it i highly recommend to learn it because its something that comes up in job descriptions a lot so head over to tailwindscom now lets go to the documentation and follow the installation instructions so we are using vit lets see what we have to do first we have to create our project which we have done so far next to install tailwind we have to install two libraries now were not going to use npm so lets grab these two libraries back to vs code lets open a new terminal window and go to packagesclient next we run bon add and paste these two libraries all right good now back to the documentation the next step is configuring the vit plugin so were going to go to vitconfigts import tailwind css on the top and add it in the list of plugins so lets grab this line copy it and go to vitconfigts we paste it here and then add it in the list of plugins this is a function so we should call it okay next we should import tailwind css in our root css file so lets grab this line and go to indexcss paste it here i believe this is the last step so thats it now we can start our application and start building so lets go to apptsx and style this message here we set class name lets set it to font bold and by the way i highly recommend to install tailwind extension in vs code to get auto completion here so here on the extensions panel search for tailwind css okay this is the extension im using tailwind css intellisense 10 million downloads all right so lets try font bold heres what we get that looks good now lets give it some padding so we can add in a padding of four which is equivalent to padding of one ram so this utility class is a container for this st padding of one ram which is 16 pixels now take a look we have some padding around the text we can also make the text larger lets try text 3x large okay thats better so that was the basics of tailwind as we go through the course im going to show you some additional features so lets wrap up this lesson by making a commit and say setup tailwind css all right we set up tailwind now were going to set up a ui component library to speed things up and thats shatzen in case you havent used it before its a collection of beautifully designed accessible and customizable components here on their homepage at uishhatsencom you can see various examples they have all these beautiful modern customizable components that we can easily add to our projects so lets follow the documentation lets go to the docs first we select our framework which is vit now we have created our project so lets move on next we should add tailwind because chaten is built with tailwind we can move on from this step we did it in the previous lesson we also imported tailwind in our indexcss file so now we should modify our typescript configuration file now in the current version of vit projects we have three typescript configuration files we have to modify two of them one of them is tsconfigjson json in this file we should add the compiler options so lets select these few lines copy now back to vs code here in the client directory look we have three typescript configuration files heres the base one with base settings that is shared between the others we have one for our react application or front end stuff and one for node which is used for tooling so first lets go to tsconfigjson and paste compiler options now back to the documentation next we should modify tsconfigappjson which is used by our react app in this file we already have the compiler options property so we should only select base url and paths lets copy these now lets go to tsconfigappjson so heres the compiler options we just paste these two properties on the top back to the documentation lets move on next we should update our v configuration file first we have to install node types so lets copy this line back to our terminal make sure youre in the client directory paste it okay now back to the docs in our v config file first we have to import path we should also import tailwind css which we did in the previous lesson so lets just grab the first import statement copy it and go to vit configts we paste it on the top back to the docs now while configuring vit we should add these two plugins react and tailwind which we did before we just have to add the resolve property so copy this and i like to order these alphabetically so after plugins i add resolve okay were almost there now back to the docs with this we can run the shatian cli with this cli we can easily add components to our project so were going to use bonx which is like npx for running packages lets copy this line back to the terminal again make sure youre in the client directory paste it all right chaten is asking what color we want to use as our base color we have a few options neutral gray zinc stone and so on what is the difference well back to their website on the top lets go to the colors page look this is an example of neutral colors then we have stone which has a warmer tone we have zinc which has a cooler tone slate gray and so on so that is the difference im going to go with neutral now this cli created a file called componentsjson which keeps track of the components we have installed let me show you componentsjson its just some internal stuff were not going to modify this this is used internally by the cli later when we install components those components will be listed here okay now this cli also modified our indexcss file lets take a quick look index css so in the previous lesson we only added tailwind css now we have a bunch of additional stuff for our theme so all the base variables for our colors padding stuff theyre all defined in our css file and we can always modify this in the future okay so back to the documentation lets move on to the next step now youre ready to install components so if you go to the components page you can see all the components in this lesson im going to add a button you can see a preview up here you can see an example in the code now on the same page you can see the installation instructions so we use bonx again to use shatn cli to add this button lets copy this line and run it in the terminal great now this button component is part of our project take a look we have all the source code here we can make any changes we want all these classes are tailwind classes so we can customize this button to achieve the look and feel were looking for okay now lets see how we can use this so we go to apptsx first lets wrap this expression in parenthesis so we can break it down into multiple lines now below the paragraph i want to add a button so we add a button component this is defined in components uibutton lets import it we give it the text like click me now because we have multiple elements we have to wrap them inside a root element okay back to the browser heres what we get beautiful but the button is too close to the edge of the screen so lets convert this to a div and give it a class of p4 now we can remove p4 from our text now take a look okay thats better so lets wrap up this lesson we make a commit and say setup shaden ui in this lesson were going to set up prettier prettier is a tool that automatically formats our code so we dont have to think about things like spacing indentation or semicolons that means fewer distractions fewer style debates and code thats easier to read for us or anyone else working on this project so there are a number of steps you have to follow pay close attention to what im doing even if you have set up prettier before first we go to the extensions panel and find the prettier extension if you havent installed it go ahead and install it next were going to define our styling rules now by default predier comes with its own rules but we can override them by creating a prettier rc file so here in the root of our project we add a file called prettier rc make sure to spell it properly here we add a json object where we define our formatting rules now there are a number of settings you can customize you can look at the prettier documentation but at a minimum you want to set single quote to true this is my personal preference i prefer single quotes to double quotes and by that im talking about javascript code not json because in json we cannot have single quotes like this okay so were going to use single quotes in this project next we set semi to true that will terminate our lines with a semicolon again my personal preference next we set trading comma to es5 this setting controls whether or not prettier adds a comma at the end of the last item in things like arrays objects or function arguments when they are written on multiple lines now if we set this to es5 this tells priier to add trailing commas where valid in es5 that means objects arrays functional arguments but not in function definitions or inline arrow functions okay the next setting were going to set is print width the default is 80 we keep that and also tab width which is the number of spaces for indentation the default is two im going to change it to three now to see this in action lets go to apptsx now in this file were using single quotes im going to change these single quotes to double and also remove the semicolon now were going to go to the command pallet we can find it under the view menu the shortcut is shift command and p on mac here search for format document now the first time you execute this command vs code will ask you about the default formatter select prettier once you do that format your code now look the double quotes are replaced with single quotes we have a semicolon and we have consistent tab width now we can also configure vs code to automatically format our code whenever we save our files to do that we go to the settings so settings the shortcut is command and comma on mac here search for format on save make sure its enabled with this if you remove this semicolon but save this file prettier automatically formats this code now we can also format our code from the command line and this is useful before committing our code to git and sharing it with others to do that first we have to install predier as a development dependency so open a terminal window a new terminal window pointing to the root of our project lets run bon adder we add this to the root of our project because we dont want this to be specific to the client or the server application okay lets install this next we go to the packagejson json file in the root of our project in this file we have a script or a command for running both applications next were going to define a command for formatting the entire codebase we set this to prettier dright period which means start from the current directory now as part of formatting our files we dont want to format third party code stored in the node modules directory so here were going to add a new file in the root of our project called predier ignore this is similar to git ignore in this file we can list all the files or directories that should be ignored by predier so at a minimum we add node modules and also its good to add bunlock this is a lock file used by bun for installing dependencies we should never touch this with this in place now we go back to the terminal in the root of our project and run bun run format all right so this formatted all the files in this project with this we can wrap up this lesson and say setup prettier music in the last lesson i showed you how we can format our code before committing it to git and i told you that this is a good practice to follow before committing our code to git and sharing it with others but theres a problem what if we forget to run this command before we make a commit this is where husky comes in with husky we can automate our git workflow so we can run certain commands like formatting our code or running tests before committing or pushing our code to get started go to typicodegithubio iohusky now lets go to the get started page first we have to install husky as a development dependency so lets copy this command back to the vs code open a terminal window pointing to the root of the project lets run this command good back to the documentation next we have to initialize husky what this does is it creates a precomit script in the husky directory ill show you that in a second so lets run bonex husky in it in the terminal window good now back to our project so here we have the husky directory in this directory we have this precommit script in this file we can add any commands that should be executed before committing our code by default it tries to run one test for running our tests because this is a good practice to follow but in this project we dont have any tests so instead we should run bun run format but theres a problem here with this command well format our entire codebase and that means as our project gets larger as we add more files this operation is going to get slower but theres a second problem if we have worked on a certain feature and modified only lets say two files this command will potentially format other files that are not formatted and well put them in our commit which can be misleading so later when we look at our git history if you open a commit well see a bunch of files that are modified just as a result of formatting so instead of formatting the entire codebase we should format only the staged files to do that were going to use a separate library called lint staged with this library we can execute tasks on staged files so back to the terminal lets install lintstaged as a development dependency lint dash staged all right good now back to our precommit script were going to replace this command with bonex lint dash staged so when were going to make a commit well run lint staged next we should tell lintstaged what task to perform on what files to do that we go in the root of our project and add a new file called lintstagedrc make sure to spell it properly in this file we add a json object where keys are file patterns like we can say any file with any name but with one of these extensions so in braces we add js jsx ts tsx and css now for the value we specify the command that should be executed for stage files that match this pattern in this case were going to run prettier dright now earlier we added a period but were not going to use that here because this will format the entire codebase starting from the current directory but in this case we only want to write or format files that match this pattern okay so to recap next time were going to commit husky will run the precommit script in this script were running lint staged lint stage will look at this file it figures out that it should run prettier on files that match this pattern okay now to see this in action lets go to apptsx and make a few changes first im going to add an exclamation mark here but im going to also mess up with formatting and also remove this semicolon now im not going to save this file because if i do so predator will automatically format this file in my vs code i have set up autosaving so under file menu we have autosave enabled which means the file is saved but its not automatically formatted formatting only happens when we explicitly save this file okay now lets go and make a commit so here we can say setup husky now there is a problem at the time of this recording i believe this is a temporary issue with vs code hopefully that doesnt happen when youre watching this video or maybe this is a problem with my setup so when i make a commit look we get this error saying bonex command not found heres whats happening so vs code is complaining that the bonex command that we have referenced in our precommit script cannot be found now this doesnt happen if we make a commit from the terminal window so one way to solve this is by adding all the files here and then making a commit lets say setup husky okay the commit is done and now we can verify that our app tsx is formatted so lets go to apptsx look the file is beautifully formatted and we have this semicolon here but what if this happens on your machine and you dont want to commit from the terminal the solution for that is to replace bonex with npx so we go to our precommit script and replace bonex with npx i know this is not ideal is kind of like a hack because we decided to use bun for the entire project but if you really like the source control panel in vs code and prefer to make commits this way you have to replace bonex with npx lets make sure this works so back to appsx again lets make a change here remove the semicolon and mess up with formatting lets make a commit im going to say test husky okay no problem but im not going to keep this commit in our history so back to the terminal lets run git log d one line so heres our commit history now the head pointer is pointing to this commit test husky we want to get rid of it and have the head point to this previous commit so the way we do that is by running get reset d hard then we get the head pointer and go one step back lets go ahead good now lets verify that everything looks good get log one line now the head pointer is pointing to this commit beautiful so were done with this section in the next section well start building our first project music chatbots are everywhere now theyre becoming a core part of modern applications so in this section were going to build one together from scratch at first glance it looks simple a text box a send button and a list of messages but behind the scenes theres a lot going on theres subtle ux details state management challenges and edge cases that are easy to overlook if you havent built one before so grab yourself a cup of coffee and lets get started now this section is a little bit longer so ive broken it down into two segments in this segment well start by building the backend for chatbot first well create a basic api that receives a message and returns a response from an ai model once thats working well gradually improve it by adding input validation error handling and making sure its robust and clean then well reorganize our code to keep things modular and easy to maintain by the end of this segment well have a fully functional production ready backend ready to plug into our front end so lets jump in in this lesson were going to build a simple api endpoint that receives a message from the user and returns a response to get started first we open a new terminal window and go to packagesserver and install openai so one addi good next we go to indexts in our server application on the top first we import open aai from openai once we run config then we create a new instance of openai with our api key so lets declare a constant called client and set it to new openai here we set api key to we go to process environment and grab open ai underline api underline key okay next we define a new endpoint for receiving prompts from the user so we call apppost now in this case were not going to use that get method because were not just getting information were submitting data to the server so we have to send an http post request to this endpoint now for the path lets go with api chat next we add a request handler so request and response now in this function first we should grab the users prompt from the request so this request object has a body property lets say in the object that we sent to the server we have a property like prompt we get that and store it in a constant a cleaner way is to use dstructuring so instead of accessing the prompt property we grab request body and dstructure it to grab the prompt property thats cleaner next we send this to openai so we call client responsescreate we pass an object first we set the model now what model are we going to use back to the openai website look here on the models page we have different categories of models we have reasoning models which are used for solving complex multistep tasks like coding problems we have another category flagship chat models theyre highly intelligent chat models then we have costop optimized models these are smaller and faster we also have research models runtime models image generation models and so on for a chatbot we can go with one of these costs optimized models because we want a small model that can quickly respond to the users queries we dont need reasoning we dont need to solve complex problems so for comparison lets compare a couple of these in terms of their performance and price im going to compare 04 mini with gpt 40 mini so on the top lets compare models here we have 04 mini lets also compare gpt40 mini now mini has various flavors we have mini audio realtime and so on were going to grab this base model now compare these two models so for omi is the fastest of all these models its a multimodal model so in the input we can pass text and image now compare the prices for this model the price of 1 million input tokens is 15 cents now compare that to this other model its 10 times more so it makes more sense to use this model for our chat application now what about context window the context window of this model is 128000 compared to this other model but for a chatbot lets say this is going to be a customer assistant usually we dont have long conversations we dont need a very large context window users come ask a few questions and move on so i believe 128000 tokens is a good size for the context window so back to the code lets set the model to gpt40 mini next we set input to users prompt its good to set a temperature now in the chatbot responses should be accurate and consistent we dont need creativity here so we should stick with lower temperatures somewhere between 2 to 4 im going to go with 02 but we can always modify this in the future theres no hard and fast rule this is more an art than science we have to test different temperatures to see what kind of responses we like more now its also good to set max output tokens otherwise the responses are going to be long but in a chat application for a chatbot we should have relatively short responses so im going to set this to 100 tokens and again we can always come back and adjust this so we call this method we await the call and get the response because we are using await we have to mark this function as async so we have the response the final step is to return a json object to the client so we call responsejson we pass an object and here we add a property like message we set it to response output text were almost done theres just one step missing look in this function were extracting the prompt from the request body by default this is not going to work unless we tell express to automatically parse json object from the request body the way we do that is by adding a middleware function so on the top once we create an app we call app dot use here we call expressjson this returns a middleware function that gets executed before passing that request to our request handler so in an express application we can have one or more middleware functions these middleware functions can be used for parsing request data for enforcing security rules for login and so on so once we install the json middleware well be able to access requestbody otherwise this is going to be undefined in other words the json middleware gets executed before our request handler it parses the json object in the request body and stores it in requestbody were done with our first step next im going to show you how to test this endpoint all right now to test our api endpoint lets go to the extensions panel and search for postman this is a very useful extension for testing api endpoints its also available as a standalone application in the past i used to use the application but recently ive been using the extension more its kind of more convenient so lets go ahead and install this once you do this go to the command pallet you can find it under the view menu the shortcut is shift command and p on mac and probably shift control p on windows here search for show postman you get this panel the first time you have to create an account and sign in i know its a pain in the neck but trust me its completely worth it it only takes a minute with this we can save your http requests in your account and share them across your different machines so you dont have to recreate them every time but you can also share your requests with other members in your team its very convenient were going to create a new http request were going to send a post request to http localhost port 3000 api chat next we go in the body tab select raw for the type of data we want to send and from this dropown list we select json now here we add a json object to send to the server so we add a json object we give it a property called prompt and set it to lets say what is the capital of france lets send this request all right we got a response with a status of 200 now let me put this side by side so you can see clearly we can toggle the view mode so heres our request and heres our response we have a message saying the capital of france is paris beautiful so our api is working lets move on to the next lesson right now our chatbot doesnt have a memory so if you ask a followup question it doesnt remember our previous questions let me show you so here im going to change the prompt to what was my previous question lets see what it says it says i cant access previous interactions or questions so how can we solve this well one very basic way to solve this is by declaring a global variable for keeping track of the last response id this is a temporary solution were going to do things step by step so outside of our route handler we declare a global variable like last response id now in terms of the type this can be either a string if we have a valid response id or null the first time were going to initialize this to null now every time we get a response from openai we update last response id we set it to response id now when calling the create method in this options object we can pass previous response id to establish a conversation history so lets set this to last response id and test our api again back to postman lets start by asking what is the capital of france it says the capital of france is paris great now lets ask what was my previous question it says your previous question was about the capital of france great so we have built memory into this chatbot but there is a problem back to our code with this global variable we can only keep track of the last response id for one conversation but in a real application we can have multiple users and each user can have multiple conversations so the right way to address this is by using a map or a dictionary so instead of one global variable we declare a map lets call it conversations we set it to a new map that here we specify the type of keys and values im going to go with string and string i will explain what it means in a second so in this dictionary or in this map were going to map conversation ids to last response id in that conversation for example we might have a conversation conversation one and the last response id in that conversation can be 100 similarly we can have another conversation and in that conversation in that thread the last response id might be 200 so were going to replace this single global variable with a map now in our route handler first we should get the conversation id from the body of the request so lets grab it from this object lets call it conversation id now this is the same experience we have in chat gpt for example when we ask a new question lets say what is the capital of france look what happens in the url this client application created a gwid or a globally unique identifier to represent this conversation so the client is sending the conversation id to the server now back to our code we have the conversation id once we get a response we should update the last response id in that conversation to do that we call conversations set as the key we provide conversation id and as the value we provide response do id and also when setting the previous response id we should get the last response id of the current conversation so we call conversations that get we pass conversation id and get the last response id lets test this so back to postman im going to start with what is the capital of france it says the capital of france is paris now i forgot to pass the conversation id so lets add conversation id here now we can use a grid or just a simple string like con one lets start again okay now in the same conversation im going to ask what was my previous question now its not updating this is a glitch with postman extension i dont know if it happens on your machine or not but if you go to the raw tab you can see the updated response sometimes it doesnt update on the pretty tab so if that happens you can simply close this window and reopen it alternatively you can use the raw or preview tabs so here it says your previous question was about the capital of france great now lets open a new conversation and in that conversation ask what was my previous question lets see what happens again the pretty tab is not updating so lets go to the raw tab it says i cant access previous questions or conversations great lets ask a different question here and say what is after one after one the next number is two now lets repeat what was my last question it says your last question was what is after one now if you ask the same question but go to a different conversation it says your last question was what was my previous question so its properly keeping track of the conversation history now back to our code so using a map we can keep track of the last response in each conversation now in this implementation we are storing these values in memory in a real application like chat gpt we should store these values in the database but thats more complicated were not going to do any database work in this project because we just want to focus on foundations later in the course we have another project that involves some database work in the last lesson we assumed that everything would go smoothly but in a real world application we cant rely on that we need to make sure that the request body contains valid data more specifically we want to make sure that prompt is a string between 1 and 1000 characters and conversation id is a valid gwid or globally unique identifier just like the guid we have here on chat gpt so how can we implement these validation rules this is where we use zot zot is a very popular data validation library used in react applications so lets open a terminal window here in the server directory lets add zot all right good now with zot we can define the shape of our objects like incoming request data and easily validate them so lets go to indexts first on the top we import z from zot now down here outside of our route handler lets declare a constant called chat schema we set it to zobject and here we pass an object for defining the shape of our incoming request data so in the request we want to have a property called prompt this should be a string so we set it to z dot string now here we can chain various methods for defining validation rules for example we can call min to specify a minimum length lets say a minimum of one character now here optionally we can provide a custom error message like prompt is required now we can chain additional methods for defining additional validation rules for example we can apply a max length of 100 characters now why do we do this because we want to prevent a bad user from posting a large amount of text and potentially bringing down our system or at a minimum we want to prevent them from wasting our tokens so we should always apply constraint on the min and max length of our strings again we provide a custom error and say prompt is too long max 1000 characters now when adding multiple validation rules i like to break my code down into multiple lines that makes it easier to see things like this thats better so thats the prompt property now in our request we also want to have a property called conversation id this should also be a string but here we dont want to apply a min and max length instead we want to make sure that this is a valid uyu id thats short for universally unique identifier so uyu id or gwit theyre the same thing now that we have a chat schema we go to our route handler the first thing were going to do is validate our incoming request data so here we call chat schema safe parse and pass request this returns an object we store it in a constant called parse result next we check if parse result is not successful then we set the status of the response to 400 which means bad request this is the standard error code we use when the client sends bad data to the server also in the body of the response we want to add a json object to provide error messages to the client we can get that object from parse result dot error dot format okay now finally we return so the rest of this method is not executed now lets test this so lets go to the postman window lets see what happens if we pass an empty string for the prompt all right heres what we get we get an object with three properties errors which contains common errors as well as prompt and conversation id which contain specific error messages for these properties so for prompt we have an error saying prompt is required and for conversation id we have another error saying invalid uyu id now lets see what happens if we pass a few white spaces so with this we have a string that is at least one character long but a string with white spaces is not a valid prompt so lets see what happens the error for the prompt property is gone which is not good so to prevent this we have to go back to our schema and before applying min and max rules first we trim the string with this we get rid of the white spaces at the beginning or end of our string now lets send this request one more time all right the error for the prompt property is back great so lets pass a valid prompt like what is the capital of france now for conversation id we need to pass a valid gwid how do we do that well we can install an extension for generating grids so here search for gwid or uiu id there are a lot of different extensions i use this one uu id generator now back to our request editor we put the cursor here bring up the command pallet and search for uyu id we have two commands the first one is generate uu id at cursor lets select this command now we have this uu id copy to clipboard lets replace con one with this valid uiu id now we send this request okay its gone through and we got a response from openai music all right now that we have added basic input validation the next step is to handle unexpected errors more gracefully in this lesson well update our api to catch and respond to runtime errors and return a proper error message to the client so look on this line where we try to get a response from openai this line might fail for various reasons maybe the network is down maybe openai servers are down perhaps we run out of tokens many different things can go wrong right now we are not handling errors so to demonstrate this i want to add an exclamation mark here to represent an invalid model now lets see what happens when we send a request to our api all right we get this html document if you preview it heres what we get error 400 the requested model does not exist and down below we have our full stack trace so we can see on which line this error has occurred this is not a good response to return from our api so instead were going to handle this error and return a proper error message to the client to do that were going to add a try catch block in our route handler so try catch in the try block we add our happy path so we add all the code for getting a response updating the conversations map and returning the response we get all this code and put it inside the try block okay now because this line for extracting the prompt and conversation id is closely related to the rest of the code i want to bring this down and put it inside the try block as well for clarity now in the catch block we handle errors in case something goes wrong first we want to set the status to 500 which means internal server error and then we want to return a json object with an error property saying failed to generate a response okay now lets see what happens if we send another request to our api all right heres what we get we get a proper error message that we can show on the client music right now there is too much happening in our chat api we have some code for managing conversation state we have our schema definition we have data validation the call to open ai theres so much happening in this file theres no real separation of concerns everything is just mixed together its kind of like a chaotic closet its hard to find a particular tshirt in this closet so now were going to refactor or reorganize our code refactoring means changing the structure of the code without changing its functionality its like reorganizing a chaotic closet were not going to add or remove clothes were just going to move everything where it belongs so were going to have different sections where each section has one and only one purpose so over the next few lessons were going to refactor our code and introduce a few layers into our application each layer will be focused and have a single responsibility at the very top well have controllers controllers are responsible for receiving http requests and returning http responses they act like a gateway into our application theyre kind of like a receptionist in a building below controllers were going to have services and this is where well have the actual application logic for example in our chat api the piece of code for calling openai to generate a response belongs to this layer belongs to a service below services well have repositories and this is where we have data so anytime we need to get or store a piece of data we worked with a repository where that data exists we dont care it could be in the memory or in a database if you follow this architecture our codebase is going to be much easier to maintain if something breaks or needs to change we know exactly where to look it also improves readability because each layer or module has one clear purpose and overall it makes our application more scalable because we can reuse and test each piece independently and plug them into new features later without duplicating code so over the next few lessons were going to refactor our code and extract these layers one by one music so we talked about the layered architecture in the previous lesson now in this architecture the direction of dependency between layers is always from top to bottom so controllers can talk to services and services can talk to repositories but not the other way around so the most fundamental layer in our application is the repository layer in this lesson well introduce a repository and then in the next lesson well introduce a service that will use our repository so i told you that repositories are for data access anytime we need to get or store a piece of data we should use a repository now back to our code look here we have this line to keep track of our conversations and these two statements for getting and storing the last response in a conversation all these pieces are about data access and should be encapsulated inside a repository so back to our project here in the server directory we add a new folder called repositories and in this folder we add a new file called conversation repositoryts now back to indexts first we grab this piece of code for declaring the conversations map we cut it and move it into our repository now in this implementation we are storing data in memory this is what we call implementation detail now when defining our modules we dont want to expose implementation detail so we dont want to export this constant from this module instead we should export what we call the public interface of the module let me give you a metaphor think of a remote control a remote control has a bunch of buttons on the outside that we use but it also has a complex electronic board on the inside that we dont care about thats the implementation detail and the buttons on the outside are the public interface so when creating this module we want to keep the implementation detail private and only export the public interface in this application we need two functions for getting and setting the last response id so we export a function called get last response id we give it a parameter conversation id of type string now we go to our indexts and grab this piece of code cut it and move it into our module and of course we return the result with this in place we go to indexts ts and here we call get last response and pass the conversation id similarly we export another function called set last response id we give it two parameters conversation id which is a string and response id which is also a string now we go back to indexts ts and grab this statement cut it and move it into this function we just have to make a tiny change all right good now back to indexts here we call set last response id and give it two arguments conversation id and response id now with this change we have kept the implementation detail private and only exported these two functions that means this indexts module doesnt know anything about where the data is stored right now its in memory if in the future we decide to modify our repository and store the data in a database this module is not going to be affected because its only dependent on these two functions for getting and setting the last response id theres just a tiny problem here with our current implementation these two functions look kind of like utility functions the responsibility or the layer they belong to is not quite clear so here were going to take a different approach were going to go to our repository instead of exporting these to standalone functions were going to export a constant called conversation repository this is an object with two methods im going to grab this function definition copy it paste it here now lets also do the same for this other function so now were exporting an object called conversation repository with these two methods now we can remove these functions save back to indexts now on the top we have these two errors because these functions no longer are exported so instead we import conversation repository from this module now down here we prefix these function calls with conversation repository like this now its quite clear in the code that were asking the conversation repository to give us the last response id so that was our first step in the next lesson were going to introduce the chat service all right now were going to introduce a service and this is where well have the actual application logic so i told you that controllers act as gateways a controller receives an http request it validates it if its valid it calls a service to do the job so a service shouldnt know anything about http requests and responses now here in our chat api up to this point we are working with the request object and down here we are working with the response so all the code in between belongs to a service so lets go to our project and here in the server directory add a new directory called services in this directory we add a new file called chatservicets ts now here we export an object called chat service and give it a single method that is send message here we need two parameters prompt which is a string and conversation id which is also a string now back to our index module lets grab this piece of code for calling openai to generate a response and also this line for updating the last response id in our conversation so lets cut these lines and move them to our chat service now here we need to import the conversation repository so real quick okay now we have an error on this line because we are using the await keyword so lets mark this as async we should also bring the client object from our index module so back to the index module now let me show you another cool shortcut press command and p on mac or control and p on windows earlier we used this shortcut to jump to a file in our project now here if we type an at sign we can jump to a symbol in this file a symbol can be a variable a constant a function and so on so here i want to find the client object there you go now we can grab these few lines cut and move them into this module now lets import open ai good now in this implementation this client object again is implementation detail so we dont want to export it outside of this module so this is the only module in our application where we know what llm were going to use if tomorrow we decide to move away from open aai and use a different llm this is the only module we should modify so the consumer of this module which is going to be our index module shouldnt know what llm we are using under the hood that is the implementation detail and what we are exporting here is the public interface okay so we dont have any errors in this module now lets go back to our index module on the top we can remove this line for importing conversation repository as well as open aai so our index module is getting leaner with each refactoring we have been doing okay now we have an error down here so first we extract the prompt and conversation id from the request body right after we call chat service dot send message we give it two arguments prompt and conversation id we await the call and get a response now here we have an error because i forgot to return the response object from our service so after we get the response we update the last response id in our conversation repository and finally we should return the response okay no more errors everything is working but theres a hidden problem here look here we are getting this response object but this object is specific to the open ai platform so here we are using the output text property to return a message to the client but what if tomorrow we use a different llm like gemini and the response object we get from gemini doesnt have a property called output text so back to our chat service this chat service object that we are exposing is what we call a leaky abstraction what does it mean well this is an abstraction over open aai because it hides the complexity it hides the details the consumers of this module like our index module dont know what llm we are using under the hood so the chat service is an abstraction over open aai but its a leaky abstraction because some of the details are being exposed to the outside to the consumers in this case we are returning this response object which is specific to the openai platform thats why we say this service is a leaky abstraction to solve this problem we have to introduce a new type that would be platform agnostic this will represent a response from an llm so up here lets define an interface we can also use a type it doesnt really make a difference we call this chat response and give it two properties at a minimum we need an id which is a string and a message which is also a string next we annotate this method with its return type it should return a promise of chat response okay now we have an error because down here were returning this response object which is not an instance of the type that we just defined so we have to return a custom object here we add two properties id which we set to response id and message which we set to responseoutput text so if tomorrow we decide to use a different llm and that llm doesnt have an output text property this is the only place in our codebase we have to modify in other words this module this chat service encapsulates all the details for working with an llm and exposes a simple interface that is our chat service with the send message method okay now back to our index module here we have to change output text to message okay no more errors now one last thing before we finish this lesson i just noticed that in our chat service we are using the wrong model so lets remove this exclamation mark great were done with this lesson in the next lesson well introduce a controller earlier i told you that a controller is a gateway to our application it receives an http request and returns an http response as part of this first it validates the request data if its invalid it returns an error otherwise it calls one or more services to perform some functionality and finally it returns a response to the client so now were going to grab all the code inside this function or this route handler and move it to a controller so back to our project here in our server application lets add a new directory called controllers inside this directory we add a new file called chatcontrollerts in this module we export an object called chat controller and give it a method called send message with two parameters request and response now while this code works its better to explicitly import these types from express so on the top import type request and response from express now back to our index module earlier we talked about the shortcut for extending selection you can find it up here on mac its control shift command and right so the cursor is here im going to hold shift control and command with my left hand and keep pressing the right arrow to extend the selection now we have the semicolon now the entire line keep going we have this entire try catch block lets keep going and now we have the entire body of this function selected cut lets paste it into our chat controller and save the changes now lets see whats happening so were using the chat service lets import it on the top were using await so lets make this method async also we need the chat schema so back to our index module once again command p on mac or controlmp on windows we type an at sign and find chat schema again we extend the selection grab this object cut it and move it to our controller module here we need to import z from zod good no more errors here now in this implementation this chat schema is implementation detail and this chat controller is the public interface so the consumer of this module which is the index module shouldnt know what library we are using for validating data that is implementation detail in other words its none of index modules business the index module just needs a method for sending a message to the application how the request is validated doesnt matter right now we are using zot tomorrow we might use a different library if we decide to replace zot with something else this is the only module we want to modify we dont want to modify both this module as well as the index module okay so no more errors here now back to the index module were going to replace this lambda function with chat controller dot send message now jump to the top lets remove this unused import statements so we can press command and period on mac or control and period on windows and delete all unused imports so again our index module is getting cleaner with each refactoring but were not done yet theres one more refactoring which well do next music right now all of our route definitions are in indexts that works fine for small projects but as our application grows keeping everything one file can get messy so in this lesson well move our route definitions into a separate file its a small change but it helps keep our code clean modular and easier to maintain as we add more endpoints so back to our project here in the server application we add a new file called routets in this file first we import express from express now back to indexts lets grab all our definitions cut and paste them here now here were using the request and response types so lets import them from express import type request and response okay good now in this module we are not going to work with the app instead were going to work with a router so here we create a router we set this object to express router on this router we register our endpoints now let me show you another cool shortcut lets say we want to rename all instances of app to router with app selected under the selection menu look at the shortcut for select all occurrences on mac its shift command and l on windows its probably shift control and l so im going to press shift command and l now we have multicursor editing all instances of app are selected so we press backspace and replace them all with router now to jump out of multicursor editing we press the escape button twice okay good now down the bottom we should import chat controller okay now technically in a real application we shouldnt have our route handlers we should only have a reference to a function inside a controller but we added these earlier for demonstration as part of setting up our full stack project these are oneliners im not worried about them at this point so we dont need to change them now finally at the end we export the router as the default object from this module im using default because this is the only object we should export from this module now back to our index module on the top we dont need this line anymore lets remove it and also chat controller instead we import router from the current folder routes so we configure our environment variables next we create an application we use the json middleware right after we add our router okay so these three lines are closely related theyre all about setting up our app theyre a little bit different from initializing the port so i like to add a line break between the two so we create the app initialize the port and finally start the app now our index module is much cleaner we only have the necessary code for starting the application all the details are somewhere else now lets review what we have done so far so we created the routes module where we have our routes or endpoints now right now we only have a single file for this purpose but as our application grows we might have various route files for different functional areas in our application for example we can have a route file for registering all the routes related to products and categories we can have another route file for managing orders we can have another route file for admin endpoints and so on okay so in this route file we are using the chat controller as our route handler lets take a quick look at this method this controller is the gateway to our application it receives an http request validates it if its valid it asks the service to do the job and finally it returns a response now in our service we have the application logic so for a chat api we have the code for calling an llm to generate a response and updating the last response id in our conversation repository in our repository we only have data access code there is no http request here there is no llm call there is no middleware setup so over the past few refactorings we broke down indexts into a set of small and focused modules each having a single responsibility the repository has data access code the service has application logic the controller acts as the gateway and the routes has all the route definitions so were done with implementing the back end over the next few lessons well start building the front end now that the back end is ready its time to move on to the front end just like we did with the back end were going to build a fully functioning chatbot step by step and once everything works the way it should well take time to refactor and organize our code to keep it clean and modular lets jump in and thats it for this tutorial what you just watched is the first two hours of my full 7hour course on building ai powered apps if you enjoy this and want to keep going the full course covers everything in much more depth youll find the link in the description i would love to have you join me in the full course and i cant wait to see

in part one we covered the fundamentals things like dependency injection and working with relational databases using spring data jpa with that foundation in place youre now ready to take the next step building real world apis in this part of the course were going to build and deploy the backend for an ecommerce application well build a clean well ststructured rest api using best practices you will learn how to implement authentication and rolebased access control how to handle payment processing with stripe and how to structure your codebase like a professional developer if youre looking for a comprehensive easy to follow well ststructured and practical course that takes you from zero to hero this is the right course for you just like part one this course is packed with handson lessons capstone projects and real world exercises designed to help you truly absorb what youre learning if youre serious about becoming a springwood developer this part will give you the experience and confidence to build and deploy production grade applications im mash hamadani a software engineer with over 20 years of experience and ive taught millions how to code and become professional software engineers through my youtube channel and online school codewithmarshcom if youre new here make sure to subscribe as we upload new videos all the time if youre ready to take your spring boot skills to the next level lets jump in and start building now let me explain how ive structured this course so you always know whats coming next and how each section builds on the last well start with a quick introduction to how the web works and how spring mvc helps us handle web requests if you have never done web development before this section is a great introduction and explains all the essential concepts you need to know next well learn how to build rest apis which are simply the parts of your application that expose data and functionality to clients like your front end or a mobile app then well move on to validating incoming data making sure users dont send us invalid or incomplete information like a product with no name or a negative price this is a critical part of building reliable apis after that well build a shopping cart system just like you would find in a real ecommerce application you will learn how to let users add products to their cart update quantities and clear the cart when they are done next well protect our apis so only logged in users can access certain parts of the application you will learn how to handle user authentication password security and restrict access based on user roles like admin versus regular user with authentication in place well move on to building the checkout and order features so users will be able to place orders and well make sure that they can only see their own order history not anyone elses then well integrate stripe to process real payments well generate a checkout page handle payment results and make sure everything updates automatically once the payment is complete finally well take the whole project live well deploy the application and database to the cloud configure everything for production and test the live version using postman this way you will understand how real applications go from your laptop to the real world by the end of this course youll have a productionready ecommerce backend with proper architecture security and deployment but more importantly youll have the skills and confidence to build real world spring boot applications from music scratch before we dive into spring boot lets quickly go over the prerequisites for this course this is an intermediate level course so there are a few things you need to be comfortable with to follow along first you should have a solid understanding of java you should be comfortable with concepts like classes interfaces and objectoriented programming if you need a refresher ive covered all of these topics in my ultimate java series i put the link below this video next you should have a basic understanding of relational databases you should know concepts like tables primary and foreign keys relationships and writing basic sql queries if you need a refresher on databases and sql check out my complete sql mastery course again link is below this video now because this is part two of my spring boot series you should ideally have completed part one or be familiar with concepts like dependency injection and beans flyway migrations entities and relationships repositories and writing custom queries if youre not familiar with these concepts i highly recommend watching part one of the course before continuing youll find the link below this video now assuming that you are the right student for this course now lets get started music all right now lets set up our development environment and look at the source code well be using in this course ive created two github repositories for this course we have the spring api starter repository which is the project we built in the first part of the course but ive done some cleanup and removed some of the playground code we had before this will be our starting point so you will clone this repository and code along with me then we have the finished repository which contains the full project well build by the end of the course in this repository we have a commit for each lesson so in case you get stuck you can always compare your code with the code i write in each lesson so head over to githubcommadanispring api starter now under code lets grab the url for this repository i have set up ssh on my machine so thats what im going to use but in case you have not set this up properly you can grab the https url copy this now open a terminal window and somewhere on your machine type git clone and paste the url good so in this folder we have spring api starter now in this course just like the first part ill be using intellij idea ultimate you can use any id you like but i highly recommend intellij because it has builtin support for spring boot and makes development a lot easier also throughout the course ill be showing you a lot of intelligj shortcuts and useful tools that will speed up your workflow so if you want to follow along i encourage you to use intelligj as well and by the way if youre using the community edition you wont get some of the features im going to show you in this course okay so lets go ahead and open our project all right heres our project lets open it all right heres the project that we built in the first part of the course but ive done some clean up and removed the stuff we dont need anymore so here in the source directory we currently have two packages entities and repositories in the entities package we have address category product profile and user ive removed the tag entity because were not going to use that in this course we had it in part one only for you to practice many to many relationships now in the repositories package we have a repository for each of these entities our repositories are empty so we dont have any custom queries here well add them as we go through this course okay now in the resources directory under migration we have a single migration so i merged all of the migrations that we created in the first part into a single migration for creating our database tables now lets go to applicationyamel and update our database settings so in this course just like the first part we are using mysql as our database engine so make sure you have mysql on your machine and then set the username and password to whatever you have configured now lets run the application with control and r intelligj is suggesting to enable annotation processing this is for lombok we covered this in part one so lets enable that good now we dont have any errors our application started on port 8080 if we head over to localhost port 8080 we get a white label error page because we havent built the homepage yet now back to intelligj lets verify that our database tables are created properly so we open the database window and add a new data source to mysql on this window we set our credentials and set the database name to store underline api now lets test the connection succeeded beautiful okay heres our database and in this database we have seven tables so this verifies that flyway successfully created our database now let me give you a few tips on how to get the most out of this course this is a handson projectbased course which means you should be coding along with spin right from the start there is a lot were going to build and a lot of new concepts to absorb this isnt a course you can just watch passively if you really want to learn and retain the material you need to be active now to keep the course efficient and respect your time ive edited out long pauses repetitive typing and other distractions youll also see me use intelligjs autocomp completion a lot to write code quickly if youre not fast with your keyboard or if you ever feel like the videos are moving too quickly heres what i recommend watch the lesson once take a few quick notes and then go back and code it at your own pace now throughout the course you will see plenty of exercises and capstone projects these arent filler theyre where the real learning happens if you just watch the videos you might feel like youre keeping up but unless you pause and try things on your own you wont learn much so please take the exercises seriously they will help you build confidence and make everything stick quite frankly this is a big course and theres a lot to learn dont feel like you need to rush take your time practice what you learn and go through it at a pace that works for you all right now lets jump in and get started welcome back in this section were going to explore spring mvc thats a framework within the spring ecosystem thats designed for building web applications well start by understanding how the web works in this lesson well cover some of the key concepts and terms used in web development if you have never done web development before make sure to watch this lesson it will give you the foundational knowledge you need to follow along after that well talk about what spring mvc is its building blocks and well see them in action youll learn how spring boot can be used to build both traditional web applications as well as modern apis by the end of this section youll have a solid understanding of how spring mvc works and how to use it to build web applications now lets jump in and get started music before we dive into building web applications with spring boot lets take a step back and understand how the web actually works if you have never done web development before this lesson will give you the foundational knowledge you need when you open a website in your browser your computer called the client sends a request to another computer called the server the server then sends back a response which the browser displays as a web page now this communication happens using a protocol called http which is short for hypertext transfer protocol its just a set of rules that computers follow to send and receive data over the internet so every time you visit a website your browser sends an http request to fetch the page the server processes the request and sends back an http response with the content of the page now whats inside a request and a response well an http request typically has a few key parts it has a method which specifies what action you want to perform the most common ones are get to retrieve data and post to send data an http request also has a url which is the address of the resource you are requesting like googlecom or amazoncomroucts an http request also has headers which contain extra information sent with the request like what kind of browser youre using or authentication details now an http request can optionally have a body that contains data for the server this is used when we need to send information to the server like when we submit a form now the response from the server also has a structure the response has a status code which tells us whether the request was successful or not there are many status codes but the common ones are 200 which means okay everything worked we also have 404 that means not found you have probably seen this before an http response also has headers that include metadata about the response like the type of content being sent an http response also has a body and this is the main content returned by the server it could be a complete web page or just some raw data depending on how the application is designed now lets talk about how web pages are structured and how they are delivered to the browser web pages are built using a language called html which is short for hypertext markup language html defines the structure of a web page like what text appears where where images go and how different elements are arranged now there are two ways web pages can be generated and displayed to the user one way is for the server to generate the entire web page before sending it to the browser this is called serverside rendering or ssr meaning the rendering or generation of a web page is done on the server so the server builds the page with all its content and structure and then sends it to the client this is how traditional web applications have worked for a long time the advantage is that the page loads completely when it arrives and search engines can easily understand it but there is another way modern applications work instead of sending a fully built web page the server can just send the raw data and let the client or the browser generate the page itself this approach is called client side rendering or csr meaning the rendering or generation of the page is done on the client okay so in this case the server doesnt return an html page but instead sends data in a format called json thats short for javascript object notation its the syntax we use for representing objects in javascript so we represent an object with curly braces and inside the object we have a bunch of key value pairs so in this approach the server sends data as json and the javascript code running in the browser then takes the data and dynamically generates the web page we use javascript frameworks like react angular and vue to take care of rendering of the page in the browser now this type of interaction where the server provides raw data instead of a full page is made possible through something called an api an api or application programming interface is simply a way for applications to communicate with each other in this case the back end exposes an api and the front end which can be built with react angular vue or other frameworks consumes it to render web pages but apis arent just for frontend applications other applications like mobile apps and even ai agents which are getting very popular these days can consume apis to retrieve and process data now you might be asking where does spring boot fit into all of this well with spring boot we can build both types of backends we can build a server that generates and returns a full html page meaning ssr but we can also build a server that returns raw json data and allow clients to generate the web page thats csr or client side rendering in this section im going to show you both approaches but because apis are the modern approach for the rest of the course well primarily focus on building apis with spring boot now that you understand how the web works lets talk about spring mvc spring mvc is a framework for building web applications it gives us all the tools we need to handle http requests generate web pages and return data to clients its part of the larger spring ecosystem and spring boot makes it really easy to use but why is it called mvc well mvc is short for model view controller its a popular design pattern for organizing our code and making it clean and maintainable in spring mvc we have three main components model view and controller the model handles the data and business logic the view is what the user sees like an html page displayed in the browser and controller is the middleman it takes a request processes it and decides what response to send back heres what happens when a user visits a web page in a spring mvc application lets say the user opens examplecombooks in their browser the browser sends a request to the books endpoint spring mvc receives the request and passes it to a controller thats listening for requests to the books endpoint the controller processes the request it might talk to a database and fetch some data and then it returns a response which can be an html page or some json data this is how spring mvc organizes our code to handle requests efficiently over the next few lessons were going to see each of these building blocks in action so here is the current homepage of our website we dont have a homepage now lets see how we can use a controller and a view to build a homepage for our website back to our project we go in the source directory main java and in this package we add a new package called controllers now in this package we add a new java class called home controller now to make this a controller we should annotate it with the controller annotation that is defined in the stereotype package with this annotation we are marking this class as a bean we talked about beans in the first part of the course but let me give you a quick refresher a bean is an object that is managed by a spring so when we mark this class with the controller annotation were telling spring that this is a bean so when the application starts spring will be able to create an instance of this class and manage that instance okay now to handle requests sent to our homepage we add a method here public string thats the name of the view that we want to return we can call the method anything we want but by convention we use index for the homepage now here we should return the name of our view which should be an html file so lets change this to indexhtml html next we should annotate this with request mapping and as an argument we provide an endpoint a forward slash represents the root of our website so when the user sends a request to the root of our website this method will be called and then it will return indexhtml to the client okay now lets build this view so back to our project we go in the resources directory and add a new directory called static this is where we add our static resources like html pages css files javascript files and so on now in this directory we add a new file indexhtml now to generate html content we type html col 5 and press tap so here we have a basic html page we press tab and here inside the body element we add a heading so we type h1 and press tab and in between these tags we type hello world now dont worry if youre not familiar with html were not going to do a lot of html work in this course okay now lets restart our application with ctrl and r good back to our homepage lets refresh and heres our homepage beautiful now lets add another endpoint so back to our home controller lets select these few lines and press command and d on mac or control and d on windows to duplicate them now were going to change the other endpoint to hello so if you send a request to the hello endpoint this other method will be called lets change it to say hello now we can return the same view or a different view for simplicity im going to return the same view lets restart our application again now if we hit hello we get the same result as before now lets right click on this page and look at page source we see the full html markup for this page this is what the server has returned to the client this is serverside rendering or ssr in action this is how traditional web applications work but later in the section im going to show you how we can build modern apis that return only data to the client and then its up to the client to take that data and generate an html page so we have created a simple controller that returns a static html page but this page doesnt have any dynamic content in the next lesson well talk about view templates which let us generate dynamic html pages music in the last lesson we created a controller that returned a static html page now to make this dynamic we have to use a template engine a template engine is a tool that allows us to create dynamic web pages by embedding variables and logic inside html files now we have several template engines for java applications we have jsp which is short for java server pages its an old technology nobody uses that anymore we also have freemaker mustache and time leaf which is the most popular template engine for spring boot applications so back to our project lets add time leaf to this project first we should go to our palm file to open that file we press shift command and o on mac or shift control and o on windows and type pom now in this file we add a starter dependency so we press command andn on mac or control andn on windows to bring up the generate context menu then we select add starter and here we search for thyme leaf by the way its time leaf its not th leaf ive seen some people call it thy leaf thats not the right pronunciation so lets add this to our project okay now back to our project here in the resources directory we add a new directory called templates by default springwood looks for time leaf templates in this directory next we should move indexhtml into this new directory okay now lets open indexhtml now time leaf has a bunch of attributes that enhances html with these attributes we can render content dynamically but to use those attributes first we have to define a namespace so we go to our html tag and type xml ns that is short for namespace colon now look intelligj is suggesting the code we have to add so we simply press tab to complete the code so with this we are saying that here were going to use attributes that will start with th and these attributes are defined by this website timeleaforg so now instead of rendering hello world statically we want to render it dynamically we want to pass the name of a person and render it here to do that we remove the content instead we type th here we can see all the time leaf attributes the one were going to use in this lesson is text and with this we can set the text of an html element dynamically now we set this to a time leaf expression first we type single quotes to represent a string here we say hello followed by a space now we want to concatenate this string with the name of a person now we want to insert the name dynamically to do that we type a dollar sign followed by curly braces and inside the braces we type the name of a variable in this case name now this variable is not correctly initialized in the next lesson ill show you how to use models to pass data from controllers to music views now to pass data from our controller to our view we go back to our controller and we give this method a parameter of type model now we have two types here one is an interface declared in this package spring framework the other one is a class that is defined in a different package make sure to import the first one so we import this now a model is basically a container for data we can use it to pass data from a controller to a view so here we call model add attribute and pass two arguments each attribute has a name and a value the name of the attribute should be the name of the variable we have used in our view so here we provide name and set the value to lets say my name mosh now here we have a little warning because intelligj cannot find this view now that were using time leaf views we should remove html here so intelligj knows that we are working with the time leaf template with this if you hold down command on mac or control on windows and then click this we can jump directly to the view similarly if you hold down command on mac or control on windows and click the variable will jump to the line where you have set that variable okay now if you dont want to use your mouse you can press command and b on mac or control and b on windows okay now we dont need the second endpoint anymore so lets remove this and restart our application now back to the homepage lets refresh and heres my name so this is how we can use a template engine to render data dynamically in the next lesson i will show you how to return json data instead of html from our music controller you have learned how we can use spring boot to return html pages to clients but what if we want to return raw data let me show you how to do that back to our project here in the controllers package we add a new class called message controller now were going to annotate this with a different annotation and that is rest controller now rest has nothing to do with having a nap its short for representational state transfer i know its one of those fancy computer science terms but in simple words rest is a set of rules that define how web applications communicate over http quite often you hear the terms rest or restful apis an api is just an interface that allows applications to talk to each other a rest or a restful api is an api that follows a set of standard rules okay so we annotate message controller with rest controller and with this were essentially building an api now were going to expose this on a particular endpoint so just like before we add a method here now this method doesnt have to return a string it can return a string it can return a number or an object any kind of data we want to return first lets return a string now lets call this say hello and expose it at slash hello okay now lets return hello world lets restart the application now if you go to our browser and hit the hello endpoint we get hello world but let me show you something interesting lets right click here and look at the page source look we only have the data unlike before we dont have any html markup now in this example were returning a simple string but we can return a complex object so back to our project lets wrap this string inside a message object we go to our project here in the entities package lets add a new java class message we give it a field private string text now we need a constructor and a getter we can manually create those or we can use lombok because were using lombok in this project just like part one so we use all arcs constructor and getter now back to our controller here we wrap hello world inside a message object okay and of course we should change the return type to message lets restart the application back to the browser lets refresh look now we have a json object so this syntax is what we use in javascript for representing objects so a curly brace represents an object and here we have a key value pair the key is text and the value is hello world so spring boot can automatically convert our java objects into json objects we dont have to worry about that kind of conversion now here im using a chrome extension thats why my json object is pretty formatted if youre not getting the same result install this extension called json formatter okay so this is how we can build apis with spring boot now with this api in place other applications can consume our data and do whatever they want for example a frontend application built with react angular or vue can take this data and generate html pages on the client thats one way a mobile app can also take our data and show it to the user but not only that even an ai agent can take our data and use it as part of implementing an automated workflow that is why in modern applications we prefer to build apis instead of returning full html markup to clients so for the rest of the course our focus will be on building apis in the next section well go deeper into building apis well talk about handling different types of http requests processing user input and returning meaningful responses so i will see you in the next section hey guys thanks for sticking with me so far just a quick break if youre enjoying this tutorial i wanted to let you know that this is just the first hour of my complete spring boot course the full course is 9 hours long and takes you way beyond the basics well build the backend for an actual ecommerce application with authentication rolebased access control shopping cart functionality payment processing with stripe and full deployment to the cloud so after you watch this tutorial if you want to learn more and level up your skills you can enroll in the full course using the link in the description all right lets keep going welcome back in this section were going to dive into building restful apis with spring boot if you have ever wondered how backend systems expose data to frontend applications mobile apps or even other services this is where it all comes together well start by creating our first restful api and learning how to test it using postman then well explore how to handle dynamic routes set http status codes and use dtos or data transfer objects to structure our responses properly you will also learn how to customize api responses extract query parameters and work with request header and body data from there well dive into the core crowd operations and even handle more advanced scenarios like actionbased updates by the end of this section youll have a solid understanding of how to build restful apis that can power web and mobile applications so lets jump in and get started music in this lesson were going to build our first restful api well create an endpoint at users that fetches all users from the database and returns them in json format so back to our project here in the controllers package we add a new class user controller then we annotate this with rest controller next we define a method that returns a list lets import it a list of user and this is the user class we have defined in the entities package now intelligj is suggesting to call this get all users thats a good name so we press tab good now in this method we should use our user repository to fetch the users from the database if i type user repository and press enter intelligj automatically adds this as a field in this class and initializes it using this constructor but in this project we are using lombok so this constructor is really unnecessary we can make our code more concise but here we have to apply the all args constructor annotation now back to our method here we call user repositoryfindall find all and return the result now we have a compilation error because our method should return a list of user but our repository is returning an iterable of user now in case you are not familiar with iterables iterable is an interface that represents a collection of elements that can be iterated over its the parent interface for list so every list object is an iterable but not every iterable is a list now here we have two options one option is to convert this iterable to a list but thats really unnecessary because we dont need any additional functionality that comes with lists a better solution is to change the return type of the method to iterable okay now to expose this at users we apply request mapping and provide slash users now in the previous section i told you that http requests have a property called method which can be get for getting data post for creating data put for updating data and delete for deleting data were going to see examples of this throughout this section for now were focusing on get now request mapping by default uses the get method but here we have another annotation thats an alias for request mapping and that is get mapping so we apply get mapping and provide users as an argument its a little bit shorter than request mapping so i prefer to use get mapping here okay so this endpoint is ready now before testing it lets populate our database with a couple of users so here in the database window we open the users table lets add a new user im going to call this user one user one at domaincom password whatever lets add one more user two user 2 at domaincom with the same password now we submit changes good lets restart our application lovely now back to the browser lets hit the users endpoint and here are our users but theres a big problem here can you see its the password field our passwords are exposed to the outside world but dont worry were going to come back and fix this later in this section so our first endpoint is ready next im going to show you an alternative way for testing our apis now while we can call apis using a browser or even command line tools a better approach is to use postman postman is a very powerful tool designed for testing and interacting with apis so if you dont have it on your machine head over to postmancomd downloads and download the latest version for your operating system now let me give you a quick tour of how postman works along with a few useful features you need to know so here on the homepage we can click plus to add a new tab now up here we can see the request method so we have get for getting data we also have post for creating data put for updating it patch and so on so we can send a get request to our new endpoint now down here we have a bunch of tabs for modifying our requests so we can go to the params tab and add query parameters well talk about this later in the section we also have authorization we have headers on this tab we can see all the request headers by default the autogenerated ones are hidden we can click and see them so these headers as you can see are key value pairs for example user agent represents the browser which is set to postman runtime in this case now practically speaking we use headers for including metadata when calling apis a common application of this is for including api keys or authentication details again well look at this later in this section here on the body tab we can include data when calling an api and this is useful for creating and updating data now we dont need to make any changes here so lets send this request now down here you can see information about the response so the status is 200 which means okay this is the time it took to get the response this is the size of the response and down here you can see the body this is the same output we had in our browser right but here we also have preview and i believe this only works if you have created an account with postman which is free with preview we can see the data in the tabular format its pretty useful now we also have a tab for viewing the response headers again these are key value pairs for example we have content type that is set to applicationjson this is the type of data that the server is sending to the client so this is the basics of postman going forward well use this tool for calling our music api so far we have built a simple api for fetching all users but what if we want to fetch a specific user by their id with restful conventions we have to expose a new endpoint where we can pass the id of a user lets see how we can implement this so back to our user controller lets add a new method that returns a user object we call this get user and give it an id parameter the type of the parameter should be long because this is the same type we used as the id of the user entity lets have a quick look here so in our user class id is a lock okay now we have to expose this at a new endpoint so we call get mapping tab this is our new endpoint users id now because id is a parameter we have to wrap it in braces and also we have to apply the pass variable annotation here with this well be able to pass id dynamically to this route okay now in this method we call user repository now intelligj is suggesting the code lets press tab so we call find by id now in the first part of the course you learn that find by id returns an optional object so here we have to decide what should happen if we cannot find this user there are two options we can throw an exception or return an alternative value like no in this case were going to call or else and provide null as an alternative value and then finally we return the result to the client now currently we have repeated users in two places this is a little bit ugly we can make our code more concise by mapping our controller to the users endpoint so up here we apply request mapping in this case we dont want to use get mapping because later were going to implement other methods for creating and updating users so we cannot use get mapping so we apply request mapping and as an argument provide users with this we can simplify our code so we remove users from here and that means we dont need to pass any arguments so no parenthesis is needed and down here again we remove users so the argument is slash id okay now lets restart our application back to postman lets hit users one okay heres our first user beautiful now whatever value we pass here by default is treated as a string but under the hood spring will automatically convert that value to a long and that means if we pass a value that cannot be converted to a long like a were going to get an error okay now lets see what happens if we try to fetch a user that doesnt exist lets say user 10 we dont get any errors the body of the response is empty but the status is 200 this is not restful in restful convention if a resource like a user cannot be found we have to set the status to 404 im going to show you how to do that next music sometimes we need more control over the response we might need to customize the headers or change the status code for example if a user is not found we should change the status to 404 which means not found and this is where we use the response entity class with response entity we can customize our responses now this is a generic class that is defined in orgspring frameworkhttp package lets import it and as a generic type argument we pass user now we have to do a bit of surgery here instead of returning the result immediately we store it in a variable then we check if user is null we should return a response entity with the status of not found now intelligj is suggesting some code i dont want to use it yet so let me show you an alternative way of returning a response entity we can create a new instance of this class now look this constructor has five overloads the first one takes a status code here we have an enum that is http status in this enum we have all the standard http status codes like not found accepted and so on so one way is to create a new response entity object like this but there is a cleaner way the response entity class has a bunch of static factory methods for creating response entity objects so here we can call not found now this method returns a headers builder object so we can call this and if you want we can further customize our headers we dont really need that so instead were going to call build to get a response entity object and this is the code that intelligj was initially suggesting okay thats better so if the user is not found we return a new response entity with the status of not found otherwise we return once again we can create a new response entity and pass the user object as well as the status code but there is a cleaner way we can use one of the static factory methods so we call return response entity okay and pass the user so going forward were going to use this approach for creating response entity objects now lets restart our application okay back to postman if we try to fetch the user with the id of 10 look we get a response with a status of 404 which means not found otherwise if we get the user with the id of one we get a response with a status of 200 music beautiful weve built a simple api for fetching users but our api currently has two problems the first problem is that were exposing our passwords thats the first problem the second problem is less visible the problem is that we are returning our user entity from our api and that means if tomorrow we decide to change our database structure and subsequently our user entity those changes will leak to the outside and can potentially break our clients for example if we decide to rename the name field to full name or remove some of these fields these changes will leak to the outside and can potentially break some of our clients so as a best practice we should try to keep our apis as stable as possible and if we need to introduce any kind of changes we should properly version our apis this is where we use data transfer objects a data transfer object or dto is a simple java object used to transfer data between different layers of an application so imagine this is our application at the heart of our application we have our entities these entities are part of the domain layer of our application at the boundary of our application which is where we have our apis well have our dtos these dtos will be the input and output from our application so going forward were going to introduce a bunch of dtos and then well need to find a way to map dtos to our entities lets see this in action so back to our project lets add a new package called dtos and in this package lets add a new class user dto and note that im not capitalizing dto im using the pascal naming convention so we are capitalizing the first letter of each word even though dtl is an acronym this is the same convention used in spring for example in spring we dont have jpa repository all in capital we have jpa using pascal naming convention okay so this is our dto now in this class we add the fields we want to expose to the outside so were going to add long id as well as string name and string email not the password not the profile nothing else okay now we need to give this a constructor so we can use all arcs constructor we also need a getter so spring can read the data from these fields and create json objects with this now we go back to our user controller instead of returning user entities we should return user details lets import it now we need to map user entities to user details to do that first we have to go to our repository so lets go to user repository and change the base type from crowd repository to jpa repository with this change the find all method returns a list so previously if you remember find all was returning an iterable but once we use a jpa repository find all returns a list now that we have a list we can use the stream api to map user objects to user details now if youre not familiar with stream api and mapping objects i covered this concept in the third part of my java series so here we call math and provide a function a lambda that takes a user and returns a new user dtol now here we should provide the arguments so user get id userget name and userget email okay now map returns a stream object so finally we need to convert it to a list okay now we need to make the same change in the other method so first we change the return type to user dto and then over here first we create a user dto and then we put it in our response user dto okay now lets restart our application back to postman lets get all our users there you go now we only have id name and email in the response not the password or the address or any other fields so this is the output from our api and we should try to keep it as stable as possible if we change our domain model meaning our user entity we just have to update our mapping code to make sure that the output from our api is stable music in the previous lesson we manually mapped a user to a user dto while this works it can become repetitive especially when dealing with large dtos with many fields this is where we use mapping libraries there are many mapping libraries out there but the two most popular ones are model mapper and map model mapper uses reflection thats why its slower and harder to debug on the other hand map generates mapping code at compile time thats why its blazing fast type safe and free of runtime overhead so in this course were going to use mapruck for mapping objects back to our project first lets go to our palm file now were going to add a new dependency so we press command and n on mac or control and n on windows to bring up the generate context menu we select dependency here we start with the organization name that is or do mapapstruct now there are two libraries we need to add one is map the other is mapstruckprocessor first were going to add mapstruck now make sure to use the same version so there are no surprises when youre following the course now lets add one more dependency orgmapststruct this time were going to add map processor okay now lets reload maven good now back to our project here were going to add a new package mappers in this package we add a new interface lets call this user mapper and change the type to interface first we should annotate this with the mapper interface defined in orgmapstruct and also as an argument we have to pass component model we should set it to spring so spring can create beans of this type at runtime now in this interface we can declare all kinds of mapping methods for example we can add a method for mapping a user to a user dto so a method that returns user dto and we call it to dto and pass user okay the name doesnt matter what matters is the source and target type with this interface in place now we can go back to our user controller and modify our mapping code so first we add a field of type user mapper and then in this method instead of manually mapping a user to user dto we get a user and call user mapper to dto and then we pass the user now when writing lambda functions whenever we have a lambda function that takes an object and then passes that object to a function we can use a shorthand syntax if you press alt and enter here intelligj suggests to replace lambda with a method reference there you go this is much more concise and cleaner than what we had before so we map objects and to do that we use user mapper to dto we should also update the mapping code in the other method there is no need to create a user dto here we can simply call user mapper 2dto and pass the user object now you might be wondering but what about the actual mapping code all we have done so far is created an interface this is the great thing about mapruck when we compile our application map will automatically implement this interface for us let me show you so lets restart our application all right now back to our project look here we have the target directory lets look at generated sources under annotations look we have this class user mapper implementation this is where we have the actual mapping code so heres our 2d method first we check if user is null we return null otherwise we create a user dto with these values so this code is autogenerated that means you should never touch it anytime you modify your source and target objects and recompile your application mapstro will automatically regenerate the mapping code now back to postman lets hit our endpoint and make sure there are no errors there you go we get the same result as before sometimes we need more control over how java objects are converted to json this process is called serialization meaning converting a java object into a json representation now similarly converting json back into a java object is called des serialization now there are situations where we need to control how java objects are serialized into json we have a few annotations for that we have json ignore for excluding fields json property for renaming them json include for excluding null or empty fields and json format for formatting values particularly dates times and numbers lets see these in action so back to our user dto lets say we want to exclude the id field from our json objects one way is to remove this field but lets say we have some other code that is dependent on the id field so we cannot remove it from this class in those situations we can apply json ignore to exclude a field from our json object now lets restart our application now lets hit the users endpoint all right look the id field is gone okay back to our code so that was json ignore we also have json property for renaming a field lets provide a different name like user underline id now lets restart our application and hit the users endpoint again there you go look id is changed to user underline id now sometimes we want to exclude null or empty fields from our json objects for example lets add another field here private string phone number now our users currently dont have a phone number so if we restart our application and hit the users endpoint phone number is null now what if we want to exclude null values from our json objects thats very easy back to our dto here we apply json include and as an argument we supply the condition for including this field now intelligj is suggesting the code lets press tab so json includeincclude is an enumeration in this enumeration we have a bunch of values the default is always we also have nonmpt and nonnull lets add null here and restart the application now lets hit the users endpoint look phone number is gone beautiful now the last annotation were going to look at is json format for formatting data so let me remove this new field we dont need it anymore instead were going to add a new field of type local datetime called created at now to give this some value we have to go to our mapper so lets go to user mapper interface now here we have to apply a special annotation for customizing the mapping code and that is mapping lets press tab to complete the code and import the mapping annotation now target we should change this to create at now we dont want to ignore this instead we want to provide a value to do that we set the expression attribute to a valid java expression lets press tab to complete the code so we set this attribute to a string and here we start with java followed by parenthesis inside parenthesis we type a valid java expression so here we are passing java time datetime do now okay now lets restart the application and hit the users endpoint all right look now each user object has a created at property now look at the value of this property we have the date component followed by a t to represent the time and heres the time component now this is the standard iso format its not very human readable and this is where we can use the json format annotation for formatting this date time so back to our dto we apply json format and press tab to complete the code so with this pattern we can provide a date in this format followed by the time in this format and of course we can always change this to fit our requirements now lets restart the application and hit the users endpoint one more time all right look created ad is now reformatted beautiful now we dont need this going forward so let me remove this and also back to our mapper interface lets remove the mapping music annotation all right now lets see how we can extract query parameters from our requests query parameters are key value pairs that are added to a url and we often use them for filtering sorting pageionation essentially as a way to provide input to our apis now here in postman we have the params tab where we can add our query parameters lets add a parameter called sort and set it to name and one more page we set it to one now as you can see up here query parameters are added after question mark and they are separated using an amperand now we dont need page in this lesson so lets simplify things and remove this parameter there you go okay so we have the sort parameter lets see how we can capture it in our api so back to our user controller here is the get all users method first we should give this a parameter of type string called sort now the type of the parameter doesnt have to be a string in this case im using string because we are capturing the name of a field but if you were capturing a page number we could use byte int long any kind of numeric types okay now if the value that is provided is not convertible to the target type well get a runtime exception okay so lets change this back to string next we should annotate this with request param now how can we sort data well we talked about this in the first part of the course find all has an overload that takes a sort object if we press command and p on mac or control p on windows we can see all the overloads here is an overload that takes a sort object we also have another that takes a pageable object and these are only available in repositories that extend jpa repository so lets quickly check lets go to user repository this interface extends jpa repository and this is the interface that provides sorting and pageionation now back to our controller so as an argument here we call sort first we import it sort by now by has a few overloads were going to use the first one that takes one or more string objects so we can pass our sort argument to sort the data we can optionally call ascending or descending we dont really need it here so lets restart our application and hit this endpoint with sort set to name all right our data is sorted by name but to verify it we go to the console window look at the first query sent to our database we are selecting all these columns from the users table and were ordering by name beautiful now what if we provide an invalid field like name x we get a runtime error that translates to a 500 error in http not the best experience for our clients a better approach is to validate the sort parameter and if its invalid we can give it a default value so back to our controller to do that there are various approaches one simple way is to define a set of valid values so we can call set first we import it set of we initialize it with name and email lets say these are the only valid values next we check if this contains the sort argument if not then we can set sort to name by default lets restart the application and hit the endpoint all right no more errors beautiful and if we check the console heres our first query in this query we are ordering users by name perfect now by default the sort parameter is required so if we dont provide it we get a bad request we can make it optional by setting the required attribute of request param to false now lets restart the application again and hit this endpoint all right now once again we got a runtime exception lets look at the console window so we got a null pointer exception cannot invoke object equals because o is null where is this happening this is happening in our user controller lets click here this is essentially happening on this line where we are validating the sort parameter we cannot pass null to the contains method to fix this issue we can give this a default value so here we have an attribute default value we can set it to an empty string we could also set it to one of our valid fields like name but i dont want to do this because if in the future we decide to change the name of this field to something else there are two places where we have to update so i would prefer to stick with an empty string with this this will be an invalid value so well set it to name by default lets restart the application and hit the end point okay now our users are sorted by name now what if you provide sort but dont set it to a value our application still works what if we set it to email now data is sorted by email to verify that lets look at the console well there are so many queries here so let me clear this and hit this endpoint one more time all right take a look now we are sorting users by email now in case youre wondering what are these two additional queries this is because of the eager loading because of the relationship we have between user and profile objects technically we dont need this relationship because the user entity essentially represents a user account when working with user accounts we dont really care about profiles profiles are additional information we have about our users they have nothing to do with authentication authorization and so on so if you want to get rid of these queries we can go to our user entity and remove the profile relationship its down here we have a onetoone relationship and thats why we have eager loading by default and in hibernate if you fetch multiple objects like multiple users and we have eager loading to another entity by default hibernate sends multiple queries to the database instead of doing a join you can always optimize this using entity graph we talked about this before but anyway it doesnt really matter in this lesson so lets remove this field restart our application and hit the users endpoint one more time okay now look in the console window we have a single query for fetching the users now let me show you a problem with this implementation lets say tomorrow we decide to rename this parameter to something else like sort by we can press shift and f6 to rename this lets change it to sort by restart the application and hit the end point now look in the console window our users are sorted by name even though we have set sort to email the reason is obvious because we renamed this parameter so this is no longer associated with the sort parameter here so as a best practice whenever you try to work with a query parameter always set the name attribute we set this to sort so if in the future we decide to rename the parameter name our code doesnt break lets restart the application and hit this endpoint now back to the console this time our users are sorted by music email all right now its time for you to practice what you have learned so in this exercise i want you to build two api endpoints for fetching product data first create an endpoint that returns a list of products this endpoint can optionally receive a query parameter called category id for filtering products by category if not provided it should return all products now the response should be a list of product details with these fields id name description price and category id so in this dto we dont have a full category object we only have category id now to implement mapping between product entity and product dto you have to add a custom annotation to your mapping method so here we have set source to category id which means we get the value from the source object we go and grab category do id and use that to set the category id field of the target object which is product dtl okay next we should build an endpoint for fetching a single product by id if the product exists return a product dto otherwise return a 404 not found error now ive put this pdf below this video so you can always come back to it spend about 20 to 30 minutes on this exercise and then come back and see my solution all right im going to go a bit faster because im assuming you have worked on this exercise and just want to quickly watch how i would implement these two end points so im going to go in the controllers package and add a new class product controller next we annotate this with rest controller and expose it at the products endpoint next we define a method that returns a list of product dto we havent created this class yet but we can create it right here we press alt and enter and create this class now we dont want to put this in the controllers package we want to put it in the dtos package next we add our fields private long id private string name price we change the type to big decimal then we add description as well as category id okay now we annotate this with data instead of getter and setter back to our controller we import list and call this method get all or get all products here we should call product repository if you press enter intelligj adds this as a field in this class and initializes it using this constructor but we can simplify this code by removing the constructor and applying the all args constructor annotation now before implementing filtering i just want to fetch all products and build a simple endpoint so i want to do this in baby steps so here we call find all next we should map products to product dtos for that we have to create a mapper so back to our project we go to the mappers package and add a new interface called product mapper we annotate this with the mapper annotation and then add a method that returns a product detail product dto dto and we give it a product object lets import product good now we should customize mapping so we apply mapping annotation thats a target as well as source attributes so we go in the source object which is a product entity and map category id to the category id field of the target object which is product dto now back to our controller we add our mapper to this class so private final product mapper now we call find all then we use the stream api and map each product to a product detail this returns a stream so we convert it to a list and then return the result finally we expose this using the get mapping annotation lets restart our application and test it up to this point so back to postman lets hit our products endpoint okay heres our product you can see that mapping is done properly so we have category id one one and two beautiful now lets implement filtering so back to our controller we give this method a parameter of type bite category id and annotate it with request pro as a best practice we give it an explicit name and then we make it optional now here depending on if you have a category or not you have to call two different methods of our repository first we have to go to our repository and add a method for filtering products by category so we return a list of product lets import this and call this method find by category id then we pass category id now back to our controller here we declare a list of product call it products then we check if we do have a category we call product repositoryfind by category id otherwise we set products to product repository final now that we have a list of products we can simply convert all of them to product dtos lets restart our application lets hit the endpoint without any query parameters okay we get all products lovely what if we set category id to an empty string we still get all products great what if you pass one as the category id we only see products in this category okay now what if we pass an invalid category we get an empty list and thats totally fine because we dont really have a product in this category now we could alternatively return a 404 error but i think thats a little bit too much theres really no need to do that that makes our api a little bit angry so were done with this now look at the console there are a bunch of queries here its not quite clear whats happening so im going to clear this window and hit this endpoint one more time all right look we have this query for fetching products and categories from our database now what if we dont provide a category id here now we get three extra queries let me show you one more time so im going to clear this window and hit the endpoint without a category in this scenario we get three queries the first one is for fetching products so we are fetching all these columns from the products table and then we have two extra queries for fetching the category for each product so in this scenario there is no join between the products and categories tables this is how hibernate works by default so if you have eager loading between two entities and we retrieve a list of entities hibernate will send additional queries for fetching the related entities now this is not the n plus1 problem because all these queries are sent in one session but we can still optimize this by using a join to fetch all the products and their categories to do that we have to go to our repository and create a new custom query method so this method should return a list of product we can call it find all with category to specify that were including categories with this query now because this is a custom query and doesnt follow the conventions in spring data jpa we have to annotate this with the query annotation we can write a jpql query like this so we select p from product p and do a join with pcate alternatively we could remove the join part and use the entity graph annotation and set attribute paths to category both give you the same result now lets go back to our controller and replace find all with find all with category lets restart the application and clear this window now lets hit this endpoint look at the console we have a single query for fetching the products and the categories and heres our left join okay so we are done with our first endpoint now one more time lets verify what happens if we pass a category id here all right looks like earlier i made a mistake in this scenario were also getting multiple queries so we can optimize this using the entity graph annotation so we go to our repository and apply the entity graph annotation on this other query method lets restart the application okay and hit this endpoint all right now we have a single query to fetch the products and categories so were done with the first endpoint the second endpoint is pretty straightforward its exactly like the code we wrote for fetching a single user so im not going to waste your time typing all that code by hand if you want to compare your code with mine we have a commit for each lesson in this repository so were done with this exercise lets move on to the next music lesson you learn how to provide additional data in requests using query parameters as i told you these query parameters are often used for filtering sorting and pageionation but we have another way for providing additional data in our requests and that is using request headers these headers just like query parameters are key value pairs here are the seven headers that are sent by postman by default if you dont see these we can toggle them up here so these are the default headers sent by postman your browser will probably send some additional headers to the back end now these headers are often used for metadata theyre often used for authentication caching and so on so as an example lets add a custom header here for passing an authentication token so by convention we prefix custom headers with xy lets call this o token and set it to 1 2 3 4 now to capture this we go back to our controller here is get all users method we add a new parameter here string o token we prefix it with request header so just like request pram we have request header now we give this a name that is x oy token now we have a little warning here intelligj is saying unknown http header we can click this link or press alt and enter to add this custom http header the warning is gone now for simplicity lets just print o token on the terminal so south tab o token lets restart the application and hit the end point all right now take a look in the console so we have 1 2 3 4 beautiful now this header is not case sensitive so if we set this to token in capital look in the terminal our application is still working but by default this is required so if we remove this from our request and hit this endpoint we get a bad request meaning we didnt provide the necessary data for calling our endpoint but we can easily make this optional just like request pram we have the required attribute here if we set this to false and restart our application and then hit this endpoint our application works beautiful so this is how we can extract request headers at this point we dont need them so to clean up our code im going to remove this parameter and the print statement so far we have covered a couple of ways for providing data with our requests we can use query parameters for providing simple values often used in sorting filtering and pageionation we can use request headers for providing metadata like authentication tokens caching and so on but there is a third way and that is using request body with this we can send the actual data or content to our back end this is often used for creating or updating objects so lets see how we can use this to send the user object to our back end now for creating objects we cannot use the get method this is only used for getting data so we should change this to post now we dont need the query parameter here so we send a post request to the users endpoint now here on the body tab lets change the type to raw now in this dropown list we can provide the type of data we want to send to the server we can send text like a string we can send javascript code json objects html and so on most of the time we use json now in this box we provide a valid json object so we add curly braces and one or more key value pairs our keys should be surrounded with double quotes so lets send a user object with the name set to mosh or whatever you want and email set to mosh atcodewithmshcom now if we send this to our back end we get an error with the status of 405 which means method not allowed because we havent implemented an endpoint that receives post requests so back to our user controller lets add a method public for now lets just return a user dto object but the return type can be anything lets call this create user and give it a parameter of type user detail and we can call this data now to receive the request body we should annotate this with request body this is a common source of errors make sure to include it otherwise youre going to get null values on your back end okay now because were using the post method we should annotate this with post mapping for now lets just return data to the client so whatever we send to this endpoint well get it in the response now lets restart the application and send this request again all right look what we get id set to null because we didnt provide it up here we only have name and email now if we use an invalid property like email x again spring is not able to initialize the email field thats why we get no now as a refresher this process the process of converting a json object to a java object is called des serialization and the other process which is converting a java object back to a json object is called serialization okay so this is how we can send data using request body in the next lesson im going to show you how we can actually create a user object music now lets see how we can create objects or resources in restful terms so were going to send a post request to the users endpoint and in the body of the request were going to include a valid user object so we should include the name the email and the password back to our controller now we have a problem in this method we are receiving a user dto object in this class we dont have the password field we had it earlier but we had to remove it because our passwords were leaking outside of our apis now you might be wondering if we can add the password field here private string password and annotate it with json ignore this is not going to solve our problem because this annotation is applied both during serialization and des serialization so that means if you have this annotation here spring will not read the password property of our json objects and put it into this dto okay so this is not going to solve our problem earlier we talked about the architecture of our application i told you that our entities are at the heart of our application and api models or dtos are at the boundary with this separation we allow the dtos and entities to evolve independently here is another example where we need a separate dto for creating new users in that dto were going to have the password field and also we are not going to have the id field this is not needed when creating a new user object right so back to our project here in the dtos package lets add a new class we can call this register user dto alternatively we can replace dto with request thats another convention a lot of people follow this better aligns with the request response model of http so this class essentially encapsulates all the data we need for sending a request to register a new user what fields do we need we need the name the email and the password and not the id field right now we should annotate this with getter and setter so spring can initialize these fields using the request data alternatively we can apply the data annotation which is the combination of getter setter to string and two hash code it makes our code a little bit cleaner now up here lets remove the unused import statements good so we have three fields now we need to provide the mapping between our new dto and user entity and for that we go to our user mapper interface here we add a new method that returns a user object we can call that to entity and give it a register user request object okay now lets go back to our controller and change the type of the parameter to register user request and for consistency i would prefer to rename the parameter to request as well now at this point we dont want to return the same request so lets return null well come back to this momentarily first lets map this request to a user entity print that entity on the terminal and make sure everything works up to this point before going further so always do one baby step at a time so here we call mapper dot to entity and provide the request object we get a user and then print it on the terminal now lets go to our user class and see if we have the two string annotation we dont have it here so lets add it temporarily now intelligj is suggesting to exclude lazy loaded fields this is for performance reasons we talked about this in the first part of the course lets just go ahead with the suggestion again this is just a temporary solution we just want to inspect the user object in the terminal before saving it to the database so lets restart the application and send this request all right obviously we dont see anything in the response the status is 200 which means no error happened now here in the terminal we have this user object id is null obviously because we havent provided it but we have the name and email fields where is password well i just realized that in part one of the course we implemented the tworing method in this class so its right here we didnt have to apply the two string annotation in this implementation we are not including the password again as a temporary solution i just want to add the password here so lets set password to password and before we forget lets remove the two string annotation on the top not needed lets restart the application and send this request okay now look in the terminal all right heres the password so our mapping is working properly now before going forward i want to undo the changes we made to the user class so we go to the commit window select the user class and roll back the changes okay now back to our controller once we have a user we can save it using our repository so user repository save user the database will assign the id to this user next we should map that to a user detail and return it from this method so we can create a user detail by calling usermapper dot dodtol and then return it at the end now intellig is suggesting that this local variable is redundant we can combine these two lines thats absolutely right but dont do this yet were going to come back to this momentarily lets restart the application and make sure that we can successfully save the user to the database so send all right heres a new user with the id of three currently our database doesnt have a unique constraint on the email so we can register multiple users with the same email thats not the right way to do it well come back and fix this in the future but what i want to point out is that every time we send this request we get a new user with a different id beautiful now there is one more piece that we have to implement before we finish this when creating resources in rest apis we should set the status to 2011 which means created to do that we have to change the return type of this method to response entity and then at the end we call response entitycreated now look at the parameter of this method it requires a uri this is the location of the new object or the new resource that is created so if you have a user with the id of five thats going to be users 5 now how can we generate that url well back to this method let me put this on a new line so you can see clearly were going to give this a second parameter of type uri components builder components builder now lets simplify the name of the parameter lets change it to uri builder thats better now once we map this user to a dtl we can call uri builder path provide the path to our resource so users id as a parameter and then we call build and expand and provide the id of the new user as an argument and finally we call dot to uri lets press tab this returns a uri object we can store it here and then at the end we call response entity created we pass the uri now this method returns a bodybuilder funny name its not a response entity to convert this to a response entity we call dot body and provide our user detail in the body of the response user detail okay now lets restart the application and see what happens so lets create one more user all right this time we got the status of 2011 now look in the headers tab so http responses just like requests also have headers here we have a header that is location its a standard http header and this is set to the url of the new resource or new user now quite frankly a lot of people dont implement this step they dont set the status to 2011 so here we could get away with generating the uri and simply return the user dto thats totally fine for internal apis but if youre building an api for public to use its best to follow standard rest music conventions all right now lets talk about updating resources to update a resource first we should change our request method to either put or patch what is the difference we use put for replacing an entire resource and patch for patching or updating one or more properties quite often we use put so lets change it to put now when updating a resource we should reference a particular resource so like the user with the id of one now just like creating resources here in the body of the request we should include some data to send to the server now when updating users we dont want to include the password because the process of updating a users password is often different from updating basic account information when updating a users password for security reasons we should provide both the old and the new password we dont want to add two password fields here like old password and new password because the user may only want to update their name and email not the password so we want to handle these two scenarios separately in this lesson were only going to focus on updating basic account information so lets remove the password property now back to our controller lets add a new method public for now lets just return a user dto and call this update user now here we shall annotate this with put mapping and provide the id parameter now because our route or endpoint has a parameter here we should add a parameter of type long id and annotate it with path variable now as a best practice we should also give it an explicit name so if tomorrow we decide to rename this parameter to something else like user id our code will not break now here we should also add another parameter for reading the request body so let me put this on a new line so we can see clearly now here we have two options one option is to use user detail lets see if that makes sense the user detail has id name and email its possible to use this dto for updating users even though we dont need to provide the id in the request body but im a bit reluctant to use this dto because in the future we might add additional fields here that may not quite apply to the process of updating user accounts so its better to create a separate dto for updating users so here in this package lets add a new java class update user request now what fields do we need here at this moment only name and email so tab and tab lets annotate this with data beautiful now back to our controller lets change the type of this parameter to update user request and also make sure to annotate it with request body otherwise its not going to work now when updating resources first we have to do some validation and make sure that that resource exists if not we should return a 404 error so here we can simply press tab to add all this code we are using the user repository to find the user with this id if not found we return null and at this point we should return a 404 error to the client so lets change the return type of this method to response entity of userdl and here we call response entity do not found build otherwise if you have this user in our database we should update it with the data in our request one way is to do manual mapping like this but i dont want to do this because this is only suitable for small objects so lets go to our user mapper interface and add a method for updating an existing user with a dto in this method we dont need to return any objects because we are not creating a new object we can call this update or whatever we want we should give it two parameters update user request and user now here we should also annotate this target entity with mapping target if you dont apply this youre going to get a compile time error now with this method in place we can go back to our controller and once we have a user object we can call user mapper update we provide our request and user entity next we call user repositorysave and finally we map this user to a user dto and return it in a response pretty straightforward now lets run the application now lets look at our database so heres our users table heres our first user im going to change the name and email of this user to mosh with mosh at code with mosh okay so were sending a put request to user one and heres our data beautiful send okay we got a 200 response and here in the body of the response you can see the updated user object now if you go back to our database and refresh the data you can see that the first user is successfully updated now to test our error handling logic lets update a user that doesnt exist like the user with the id of 100 okay we get a standard 404 error beautiful next were going to talk about deleting music resources deleting a resource is pretty straightforward first we should change the request method to delete now just like updating a resource we should reference a particular resource like the user with id one but unlike the update scenario we dont need to include any data in the body of the request so we can delete all this data now back to our controller lets add a new method public for now im going to use void as the return type but well come back and change this in a second so void delete user we should give it a pass variable and of course a delete mapping to capture the id now in this method just like the update method first we should get the user from our repository and if it doesnt exist we should return a 404 error so lets change the return type to response entity now we dont want to return any data to the client so we can pass void here now to save time im going to borrow some code from the update method so the first three lines where we fetch a user and return a not found error so copy paste it here otherwise if we do have a user we call user repository delete user and finally we return response entity nocontentbuild lets restart our application and delete the user with the id of one okay we got a 204 response no content now lets look at our users table our first user is gone beautiful now what if we try to delete a user that doesnt exist we get a 404 music error in restful apis we typically use put or patch for updating resources but some updates represent an action rather than just modifying a field examples are changing a users password or submitting an approval request in these cases its better to use a post request instead of put or patch because were not just updating a resource were creating a request to perform an action now lets see how we can take this concept and use it to implement an endpoint for changing a users password so were going to send a post request to a new endpoint like this users onechange password so we are creating a new change password request okay were not updating a field were creating a request to perform an action now when hitting this endpoint in the body of the request we should provide the old and the new password so lets set old password to 1 2 3 4 and new password to lets say 5 6 7 8 now back to our project here in the details package lets add a new class change password request we annotate this with a data annotation and give it two fields old and new password next we go to our user controller and define a new method for updating the password so public now for the return type were going to use response entity of void because were not going to return any data in the response we can call this change password next we should annotate this with post mapping so we provide the id parameter and then add change password now because we have the id parameter we should add a parameter of type long here and annotate it with pass variable we also need a parameter for reading the request body so let me put this on a new line and then we add the second parameter that is change password request and we should annotate it with request body okay now in this method first we should fetch the user with our repository and if we cant find it we should return a 404 error so im going to borrow this piece of code from our delete method paste it here simple next we should validate the old password so we check if user get password that equals request get old password well we have to inverse this condition to not equal in this case here we have two options intelligent is suggesting to return a bat request or a 400 error but i think a more appropriate status here is unauthorized because if a client doesnt provide the correct old password its not authorized to perform this action now in this class we dont have a factory method for setting the status to unauthorized so we have to new up a response entity and here we use http status dot unauthorized otherwise if the password is correct we should update it now im going to go ahead with intellig suggestion so lets add these three lines we simply update the users password using the new password and for this we can use this single line we dont need to update our mapper we should use our mapper only when we are dealing with mapping large or complex objects then we save the user and finally we return a response with no content now lets restart our application and test our new endpoint first i want to test a scenario where the user doesnt exist so user 100 we get a 404 error beautiful now lets try user two now currently in my database the password of this user is 1 2 3 1 2 3 so obviously the old password is incorrect lets send this request we get a 401 or unauthorized response beautiful now what if we provide the correct password we get a 204 response no error but no content now if you refresh our database we can see that the password is updated now currently were storing the passwords as plain text obviously this is something you should avoid at all cost but later when we talk about security well come back and fix this issue music okay for your next exercise i want you to implement create update and delete operations for products first implement an endpoint for creating a new product at this endpoint we should receive a product dto with these fields this is the same product dto we created earlier in the section so in this case we are not going to create a separate dto for creating and updating products because in many cases the fields we need for creating or updating a resource are the same so we dont always have to create separate dtos for creating and updating resources okay so we send a product dto to this endpoint and then we get a 2011 response with the created product now updating and deleting the product is pretty straightforward go through this pdf i put the link below this video spend about 20 to 30 minutes on this exercise and then come back and see my solution all right so here in product controller we define a new method that returns a response entity of product detail we call it create product and give it a product dto object now make sure you have annotated this with request body otherwise you will not receive the data posted to the server now we annotate this with post mapping now in this method first we should map this dto to a product entity so we go to our product mapper interface and define a new method that returns a product object so we call it two entity and give it a product dto now back to our controller first we call product mapper dot to entity we pass the detail and get a new product next we call product repository that save product now before implementing the full picture i just want to return this new product so at this point i dont want to set the status to 2011 we want to implement this with baby steps so we call response entity now there is no need to map this product to a new dto because this dto that we have up here has all the data that we need to send back to the client the only thing that is missing is the id so after we save the product we call product dto set id and then we can simply return the same dto back to the client lets restart our application back to postman lets send a post request to the products endpoint in the body of the request im going to include this json object we have name price description and category id lets send this all right heres what we get our new product id is 13 beautiful we have name price description and category id lets verify that this object is also stored in the database so we go to the database window and open the products table heres our new product but look category id is missing because in our controller once we map this dto to an entity we lose category id in this dto we have a field called category id but there is no field with the same name in this entity so to solve this issue we have to fetch the category separately from the database so first we call category repository now intelligj should add this as a field in this class there you go so we call category repository that find by id and here we pass product dto that get category id or else null so we retrieve the category now we have to do a bit of validation so if category is null then we want to return a bad request to the client i didnt specify this in the pdf so thats totally fine if you missed this step because in this section our focus is not on error handling and data validation well talk about that in the next section anyway we get the category now before saving the product we should set the category so we call product set category and pass the category now lets restart the application and hit this endpoint one more time okay back to the database heres our new product and category id is successfully stored here now to verify our error handling code lets pass an invalid category id in this case we get a 400 response beautiful were almost done with this method the final step is returning a 2011 response with the uri of the new resource to do that we have to add a second parameter here of type uri components builder after we save the product we need to create this uri so we call uri builder provide the path then call build and expand and finally call to uri we get a uri object then we call response entitycreated we provide the uri and the detail in the body of the response lets restart and hit this endpoint one more time we have a 2011 response and in the headers we have the location of the new resource beautiful were done with the create operation now lets implement the update operation back to our controller we add a new method that returns a response entity of product dto we call it update product now intelligia is suggesting a big chunk of code lets just add all of that in one go so here we have two parameters long id which is decorated with pass variable that means we should also annotate this method with put mapping we also have product dto in the body of the request so first we fetch the product from our database if it doesnt exist we return a not found error otherwise we should map this dto to a product entity more accurately we should copy these values into our existing product entity so we go to our product mapper and add a new method void update with two parameters product detail and product now we should annotate this with mapping target otherwise mapping is not going to work now back to our controller once we have a product we call product mapper update and pass these two objects next we save the product and finally we return our dto to the client so product dto again there is no need to map our product entity back to a dto this dto that we receive in this method has all the data we need okay lets restart the application now here in postman lets send a put request to products 1 i dont have this product in my database so now we should get a 404 error take a look there you go beautiful now lets send a put request to product 4 okay we got an internal server error all right we got a hibernate exception saying identifier of an instance of product was altered from null to four what is happening well this was the tricky part of this exercise so when we call productmapper update something goes wrong this product detail doesnt have an id because in this method we are receiving the id as a path variable okay so product d is here doesnt have an id and when we copy id to this product the id of this product changes from whatever we had which was four to null thats why we get this exception to fix this issue we have to go to product mapper and when updating an existing product we should tell mapr to ignore the id field to do that we customize mapping so we add the mapping annotation target should be id and here we set ignore to true now lets restart the application and send this request again all right we got a 200 response but the id that we have in the response is no thats an easy fix back to our controller i told you that our product detail doesnt have an id so after we save this product we can store the id in the product dto just like we did in the create endpoint so we set the id and then return this dto to the client lets restart the application and send this request again heres the id now lets verify that we have the correct data in our database so heres product 4 all the values seem to be updated correctly now lets change category id and see what happens so im going to change category id to two and send this request again now lets refresh okay category id is not updated for the same reason it was not stored when we created a new product so back to our controller we have to fetch the category separately so here we call category repository find by id we get this category store it here category if it doesnt exist we return a bad request otherwise we fetch the product we do the basic mapping then we associate our product with this category with the new category and then save it in the database lets restart the application and send this request one more time okay no errors and we see category id 2 in the response now back in the database you can see that category id is now updated to verify it one more time lets change it back to one and resend this request good now lets refresh this table and heres the updated category beautiful the final part is the delete operation so we define a new method public response entity of void delete product we give it a pass variable id and annotated with delete mapping in this method first we use our repository to fetch this product if it doesnt exist we return a not found error otherwise we delete this product from our repository and return a response with no content lets restart the application now lets send a delete request to this endpoint we got a 204 response with no content if we resend this request we get a 404 error because this product no longer exists hey guys thanks for sticking with me so far if youre enjoying this tutorial i wanted to let you know that this is just the first hour of my complete spring boot course the full course is 9 hours long and takes you way beyond the basics well build the back end for an actual

course youll learn everything you need to know from the basics to more advanced concepts so by the end youll be able to build real world applications with confidence if youre looking for a comprehensive easy to follow well structured and practical course that takes you from zero to hero this is the spring boot course for you ive organized this course in two parts the first part which youre watching now covers the fundamental concepts and the second part focuses on building web applications and apis the course is packed with handson examples and real world exercises to help you truly absorb and apply what you learn ive poured my heart and soul into creating this course and im confident it will be a game cher for your skills im m hamadani a software engineer with over 20 years of experience and ive taught millions how to code and become professional software engineers through my youtube channel and online school codm marcom if youre new here make sure to subscribe as i upload new videos all the time so if youre ready to master spring boot and build applications with confidence lets jump in and get music started to get the most out of this course you should have a solid understanding of java you should be comfortable with objectoriented programming working with classes methods and interfaces if youre new to java or need a refresher i recommend going through my java course before starting this one ill put the link down below you should also be familiar with relational databases and sql you should know concepts like tables primary keys foreign keys and writing basic queries if this sounds new to you or you want to strengthen your sql skills check out my sql course where i cover everything from the basics to more advanced queries thats all you need to get started if you already meet these prerequisites youre good to go otherwise take some time to review java and sql before jumping in now lets move on to the next music lesson before we dive in lets talk about how ive structured this course so you know what to expect and how to get the most out of it this course is divided into two parts the first part which youre watching now covers the fundamentals of spring boot the second part will focus on building web applications and apis in the first part well go step by step to build a strong foundation so that when we move on to building applications you will have all the essential skills you need part one is divided into three sections well begin by understanding what spring boot is and why its such a powerful framework well also set up our development environment and build our first spring boot project so we can get a feel for how everything works then we have dependency injection in this section you will learn how spring boot manages objects and their dependencies behind the scenes making our applications more modular testable and maintain aable in the next section we talk about database integration with spring data jpa this is the bread and butter of part one we cover concepts that are often overlooked in other courses you will learn best practices efficient data access patterns and tools that are essential for building real world applications to get the most out of this course watch every lesson in sequence i cover a lot of details that built on previous concepts so skipping around might cause you to miss something important this course is also packed with exercises to reinforce what you learn i strongly encourage you to complete each exercise before watching my solution struggling a bit before seeing the answer will help you retain the concepts much better now that you know how the course is structured lets move on to the next music lesson as you go through the course youll often want to check out the exact code i write in each lesson so to make it easy for you to follow along ive organized the source code using a github rep repository that you can find at githubcom hamedani sspring store now technically you dont need to know git to take this course but git is one of those skills that every developer must have if you want to dive deep and truly master git i have a complete git course on my website where i teach everything from the fundamentals to advanced workflows you can find it on codewithc now back to our repository in this repository each commit represents a lesson so if you want to see the exact code i write in this lesson just click here and you can see the changes also ive created tags for the beginning of each section for example if you want to start from part one section 4 you can use this tag its not something that i recommend unless youre an advanced student because theres so much that were going to cover in this course and ideally you should watch every lesson in order so thats all about our git repository lets move on and continue learning learning welcome to the first section of the course in this section well take our first steps with spring boot well start by learning what spring boot is and why its so popular among java developers next well get our development environment set up and create our first spring wood project ill walk you through the project structure so you understand how everything is organized from there well dive into dependency management then build and run our first spring wood application well also cover some essential tools like spring boot dev tools that make development faster and easier you will learn how to configure your app with properties and how to debug it when things go wrong by the end of this section youll be comfortable setting up and running spring boot projects and you will have your first application up and running now lets get music started before we jump into writing code lets take a few minutes and talk about what spring framework is what it off offers and how spring boot builds on it to make our lives easier lets start with the spring framework its a popular framework for building java applications think of it as a toolbox for building applications it has a lot of modules each designed to handle a specific task these modules are broadly categorized into a few different layers at the core we have modules for handling dependency injection and managing objects well talk about that in detail in the next section in the web layer we have modules for building web applications with these modules we can handle web requests process data and return responses whether its html for a web page or json for an api in the data layer we have modules for working b databases whether youre using sql no sql or even inmemory databases we also have a module for adding cross cutting features like logging or security without cluttering the main code this is called aop or aspect oriented programming we also have a module for testing of spring components now the beauty of spring is that its modular so you can pick and choose the modules you need for your project its powerful and flexible which is why so many developers love it now while the spring framework is powerful using it often involves a lot of configuration for example if you want to build a web application you might need to set up a web server configure routing and manage dependencies manually this can make development slower and more complex thats where spring boot comes in think of spring boot as a layer on top of the spring framework that takes care of all the tedious setup for you it simplifies spring development by providing sensible defaults and ready to use features so why does this matter with spring boot you can go from idea to work in application in minutes instead of hours it saves you time reduces boilerplate code and lets you focus on what really matters building great features for your users by the way the spring framework is just one part of a larger family of projects in the spring ecosystem these projects extend the capabilities of the framework to address specific needs for example we have spring data for simplifying database access we have spring security for adding authentication and authorization to our applications we have spring batch for batch processing spring cloud for building microservices and distributed systems we have spring integration for simplify messaging and integration between systems and more now that you understand what the spring framework and spring boot are and how they fit in the larger spring ecosystem lets start building music before we start building applications with spring boot we need to get our development environment ready first you need the latest version of the java development kit or jdk so open up your browser and search for download jdk you can find it on articlecom now at the time of this video the latest version is jdk 23 it is possible that in the future when youre watching this video there is a newer version of jdk available thats not going to make this course outdated because what im going to teach you in this course will apply to future versions of jdk as well so download the latest version of jdk here as you can see there are distributions for different operating systems linux mac os and windows once you download and install the latest version of jdk open up your terminal window and run java dash version to verify that the jdk is installed correctly so as you can see on this this machine im running jdk version 23 next we need a code editor in this course ill be using intelligent idea thats the most popular id for professional java and cotland development intelligent idea comes with a variety of builtin tools specifically designed for productive development with spring boot you can also consider alternatives like vs code or eclipse i personally love intelligent idea especially because of its smart editor it not only autocompletes method name but also suggests entire chunks of code that you can insert with a single p of tab youll see me doing that throughout the course this makes it much easier to write high quality code faster without getting stuck on syntax or boilerplate i highly recommend using intelligent idea for this course because it simplifies your workflow and helps you focus on learning spring boot instead of dealing with setup issues and here is something great thanks to jet brins the creators of powerful ids plugins and services you can try intelligent idea ultimate free for 3 months using the link and promo code below this video now the next step is installing a build automation tool for building and packaging our application here we have two options maven and gradle different people have different preferences but in this course well be using maven because its more popular now if youre using intell you dont need to install maven separately because intellig has maven builtin thats one of the reasons i said intellig makes it much easier to get started it comes with all the tools you need to build spring wood applications but otherwise if youre using vs code or eclipse youll have to install maven separately you can download maven from maven apacheorg now if youre on a mac you can install maven with homebrew its much easier so open up your terminal first run brew update and then run brew install maven its much easier to install it this way if youre on windows i recommend installing maven using chocolatey in case you are not familiar with it its a package manager for windows so first head over to chocorg download and install chocy then open your terminal window and run choco install maven now once youre done to verify that maven is installed properly run mvn dv so on this machine im running apache maven 39 music now there are two ways to create a new spring boot project one way is to go to start springio on this page we can select a few options and generate a new spring boot project so first we specify our build tool which can be gril or maven by default maven is selected so we keep it as is next we select our language which is java then we select the version of spring boot at the time of this course the latest stable version is 34 1 there is a newer version but thats a snapshot version so it has experimental features that might be removed in the future so make sure to select the latest stable version now under project metadata we have group which is the group or organization that owns this project by convention we use a reverse domain name so examplecom becomes com example now in my case im going to change this to code with mh next we have artifact which is the name of the project im going to change that to store because were going to build an online store in this course now name is the same so whenever we change artifact name gets updated as well we can leave description as is now package name is the combination of the group and artifact again were not going to touch this next we have the package type which can be jar or war were going to use jar and then we specify the java version in this course well be using java 23 three next we can select our dependencies these are third party libraries or frameworks were going to use in our project well talk about these later in the section next we go ahead and click generate now this gives us a zip file once you unpack it you can open it with your favorite editor but again i recommend you to use intellig because when using intellig we dont even have to go to this website to create a new spring boot project we can create a project right inside of intellig so open intellig and click new project now on the left side under generators select spring boot now what you see on the right side is exactly what you saw earlier on start springio now i need to highlight that this feature is only available in intelligent idea ultimate edition if youre using the community edition which i dont recommend you wont see this feature the community edition is quite limited in terms of features so if you want to do professional development you should use the ultimate edition so first first we specify our project name im going to change this to store next we specify the location you can put it anywhere you want on your machine it doesnt matter now optionally we can create a git repository i recommend you to do this so you can properly version your code next we specify our language java our build tool maven our group im going to change this to com code with mh we leave artifact and package name as is next we specify the jdk version right here we have jdk 23 but what is beautiful about intell is that we can also download the latest version right here so we dont have to go to our browser to download jdk separately from oraclecom okay next we select the java version im going to change this to 23 and click next now up here you can see the version of spring boot that is 341 optionally we can select our dependencies again were going to leave this for now and come back to it later so lets go ahead and create our first spring boot music project all right now lets talk about our project structure first we have this folder idea that contains a bunch of configuration files used by intellig you never have to touch these then we have mvn this is part of maven wrapper which is a way to run maven without requiring it to be globally installed on your machine with this we can ensure consistent maven builds across different environments so we can take this project put it on a different machine and build it with the exact same version of maven and with this we can prevent surprises let me show you what we have here so inside this folder we have the wrapper folder and in this folder we have a configuration file that specifies the version of maven were going to build this project with that is 332 this is different from the maven you have globally install on your machine now once again i want to emphasize if you use intellig you dont need to install maven globally on your machine because intell comes with maven builtin okay so this is our configuration file now in this project we also have two maven rapper files in the rout we have mvnw which is for mac or linux and m bw cmd for windows both of these files are shell scripts so here we have some code that would automatically download the version of maven specified in this configuration file okay so thats the mvn folder then we have a couple of files for ar gift repositories thats pretty standard were not going to talk about them in this course we have help md which is a markdown file that contains instructions for getting started again we dont care about it next we have palm xml this is short project object model and this is the heart of a maven project so in this file we have some configuration about our project and its dependencies now what you see here is a format called xml which a lot of younger developers are not familiar with its similar to html so here we have open and close tags and in between these tags we have some data so here we have all the attributes we specified at the time of creating our project we have group id artifact fact id this is the version of our project and so on further down below we have a tag called dependencies which were going to talk about later in this section so palm xml is the heart of maven projects maven uses this file to download dependencies and build our project now back to our project structure in the source folder we have the actual code for our project we have main and test in the test folder we write our automated test in the main folder we write the actual code here we have two subfolders java where we have our java files and resources where we have nonjava files like configuration files as well as static assets like html css javascript and so on in the resources folder we have a configuration file called application properties here we can have one or more key value pairs so here is a key spring application name and the value is store in this file we can specify the server port our database settings and so on now here in the java folder we have a package based on the group and artifact we specified when creating this project in this package we currently have one file store application which is the entry point to our application so here we have a java class and inside this class we have our familiar main method in this method we have a call to spring app applicationrun method so thats the basics of our project structure next were going to talk about dependency music management earlier we talked about dependencies i told you that dependencies are thirdparty libraries or frameworks we use in our application for example to build a web application we need an embedded web server like tomcat we need libraries for handling web requests building apis processing json data logging and so on now in spring boot applications instead of adding multiple individual libraries we can use a starter dependency which is a curated collection of libraries and frameworks that are commonly used together theyre tested and verified by the spring development team so in this example if you add the starter web dependency it will bring in a compatible version of these libraries lets see this in action so open up your browser and search for maven central its right here central sonot typecom now maven central is a public repository where we can find dependencies for our projects its similar to npm for javascript pipie for python new get for net and so on now here lets search for springbootstarterweb all right here is the first item in the result this dependency or this project is owned by or spring framework boot now lets click on the dependency name now to use this in our project all we have to do is copy this piece of code in our palom file now this piece of code is dependent on our build tool so up here you can see we have apache maven so for maven projects we have to copy this piece of code but if we use a different build tool like grale then we have to copy a different piece of code okay so back to to apache maven now here you can see we have a dependency the group id is org springf framework boot and the artifact is spring boot starter web we also have the version now lets copy this to clipboard back to intellig lets go to our pom file now in this file we have a tag called dependencies where we can list the dependencies of our project this new project that we have created has two dependencies by default one of them is is spring boot starter the other is spring boot starter test now after these two dependency tags were going to paste the piece of code that we just copied now here we have an error on the version because intell cannot find this dependency in our local repository it cannot find in our machine to fix this issue we have to click on this m box up here for synchronizing maven changes so whenever we added dependency to our project we have to click this icon to reload our maven project and then intellig will download our new dependencies so im going to click this now look down here its resolving this dependencies okay the error is gone so this is one way to add a dependency we go to maven central we copy a piece of code add it to our pump file and then reload our maven project thats one way but there is an easier way first let me remove this new dependency so delete now here we can press command and n on mac or control and n on windows to bring up the context menu here we select dependency now in this search box we search for spring das boot das starter d web now if this doesnt work on your machine remove and reinstall intellig that will solve the problem okay now here you can see various dependencies that match the search pattern were going to select this one from or the springf framework boot and this is spring boot starter web version 332 lets add this to our project once again we have an error here because this version doesnt exist in our local repository so we click on the maven icon here to reload our project and now intellig downloaded this dependency into our local repository now if you look on the right side we have this maven panel in this panel we have our project here we have a node called repositories so we have two repositories a local repository which is a folder on our machine where these dependencies are stored on mac its inside our home folder sl m2 repository on windows is probably somewhere like c drive back sl users back sl whatever now we also have a central repository which references maven central okay now lets take a look inside the dependencies note so currently we have three dependencies in this project this is the dependency that we just added spring boot starter web now earlier i told you that starter dependencies are curated collection of libraries that work together so if you expand this you can see here we have another dependency for working with json data well talk about this in the future we have a dependency for tomcat which is our embedded web server we have a dependency to spring web and spring web mvc these are used for building web applications with these libraries we can process web requests and build apis now one more thing before we finish this lesson when working with spring boot dependencies as a best practice we should remove the version here and let spring boot manage versioning for us let me explain what i mean so first lets remove the version tag okay now lets go to the top here on the top we have this parent tag that references a parent project look at the artifact id its spring boot starter parent now if you hold down the command key on mac or control key on windows and hover our mouse over here we can click and go to the p file of this parent project so now we are inside a separate pom file once again here we have a parent tag that references a different project that is spring boot dependencies so once again hold down command on mac or control on windows and click here so here is the actual parent or grand parent of our project now if youre on mac press command and f if youre on windows press control and f and search for springbootstarterweb look here we have a dependency to this package and the version that is specified here is 341 similarly we have other dependencies and their versions and these are tested to work together so back to our p file using this mechanism we allow the dependencies that we had here inherit their version from this parent project so if theyre listed in the parent project that version that is compatible with our project will be used here otherwise maven will use the latest version of those dependencies now this has two benefits one benefit is that it simplifies our pom fight so down here where we specify our dependencies we dont have to include their version the other benefit is that if you upgrade the version of spring boot all dependency versions are automatically updated to their tested compatible counterparts so as a best practice when working with spring boot dependencies we should remove the version and let spring boot manage versions for us music in this lesson well create our first controller to handle requests to the homepage and serve a simple html file but before we start coding lets take a moment to understand the basics of spring mvc which is the foundation of how we handle web requests in spring boot spring mvc stands for model view controller and its part of the spring framework that helps us build web applications it provides a clean way to separate different parts of our application making it easier to manage and scale model is where our applications data lives it represents the business logic and is usually connected to a database or other data sources in spring boot the model can be a simple java class the view is what the user sees its the html css or javascript thats rendered in the browser in spring mvc views can be static files or dynamically generated using tools like time leaf the controller is like a traffic control controller it handles incoming requests from the user interacts with the model to get data and then tells the view what to display lets see this in action so back to our project here in the java folder inside this package lets right click and add a new java class were going to call this home controller now intellig is asking if you want to add this to our git repository im going to select dont ask again so we dont see this in the future lets go ahead and add this to our repository okay now to make this a controller we have to decorate it with the controller annotation so here we type an ad sign followed by controller and then press enter so this annotation is defined in this package org springframework do stereotype okay now i believe i covered annotations in my java course but very briefly an annotation is like a label or a tag that we add in the code to give instructions or additional context to the compiler we can apply them to classes methods fields parameters and so on so in this example by adding this annotation to this class we are telling spring that this class should be used as a web controller for receiving web traffic now inside this class we add a method public string we can call this method anything we want but im going to go with index now when we send a request to the root of our website we want this method to be called to do that we have to apply another special annotation here that is request mapping now this other annotation is defined in this package or springf framework web this is part of the web starter dependency that we added in the previous lesson okay so we add this annotation and then give it an argument that is a url pattern here we can type a forward slash that represents the root of our website so when a request goes to the root of our website this method gets called if you want to receive traffic at a different endpoint like about or contact we can change the argument here okay so lets go back to the root of our website now in this method we return the name of the view that should be returned to the browser so we return indexhtml okay now we need to create this view back to our project we go to the resources folder this is where we add non java files now here we add a new folder called static and inside the static folder we add a new file well a new html file called indexhtml now in this html file inside the body element we type h1 tab and and inside the h1 tag we type hello world so this is our view now were not going to cover models in this lesson well cover them later in the course next im going to show you how to build and run this application hey guys thanks for sticking with me so far just a quick break if youre enjoying this tutorial i wanted to let you know that this is just the first hour of my complete spring boot course the full course has two parts with each part being about 6 hours long it covers a whole lot more taking you from the basics all the way to advanced concepts you will learn everything you need to build real world backends with spring boot so after you watched this tutorial if you want to learn more and level up your skills check out the link in the description below and enroll in the complete course now lets jump back music in all right now lets talk about running our application if youre using intellig you can run this application by clicking the play icon on the toolbar look at the shortcut its contrl and r so im going to press that our application is built now here on the console window if you scroll to the right you can see that tomcat which is our embedded web server is initialized with port 880 so now if you open our browser and navigate to local host port ad8 we can see our homepage beautiful now let me show you a different way way to run this application back to intellig first im going to stop this now if youre not using intellig you can run this application using maven first we have to open a terminal window and go to our project folder ive put this project on my desktop inside spring boot sl demo store so right now im inside the project folder you can see that in the terminal im on the main branch of my git rep repository so if youre run ls on mac or linux or there on windows we should be able to see our project files so look earlier we talked about these two files and vnw that is a maven wrapper so if you dont have maven globally install on your machine you can use the maven wrapper now here on mac or linux to run this we have to type period slash mvnw then we type a space followed by v so as you can see im running maven 390 now if youre using windows you have to type mvnw cmd space v actually i think cmd is optional but im not entirely sure i havent used windows for over 10 years so excuse me if im making a mistake here anyway so now with this maven wrapper we can run our spring boot application but instead of v were going to type spring das boot colon run take a look maven compile our application so now once again if we go back to our browser and navigate to this address we should see our homepage you have probably seen this guy before in my other courses his name is john smith hes our selfproclaimed rockstar developer who claims he writes bug free code according to john debugging is something other people need to do but lets be real bugs happen to all of us even if youre as perfect as john smith thinks he is so in this lesson im going to show you a few different techniques for debugging your spring board applications back to our home controller lets make a few small changes and introduce a bug first lets define a private method that returns a string we call this get view name and here we return index instead of indexhtml now back our index method first we declare a variable called view name and here we call get view name and then we return view name obviously this is unnecessary this code is very redundant but we are deliberately doing this for the purpose of debugging now lets rerun our application so we press contrl and r intellig is saying that this process is running its asking us if you want to stop and restart the web server lets go ahead all right good back to the browser lets refresh all right now we have an error because there is no view called index our view file is indexhtml so lets see how we can find this book back to our home controller the simplest way to debug this application is using a print statement so before we return the name of the view we can type system out printline view name now lets rerun this application okay back to the browser refresh now we go back to intellig here on the console window we can see the output of our print statement so we are returning index which is not a valid view name so this is a simple way we can debug our applications but we can also use the debugging tools in intellig or other ids to do that first lets remove this print statement all right now were going to start our application in the debug mode and executed line by line to do that first we have to insert a breakpoint in our code a breakpoint is a marker that tells intellig to pause our application when the program reaches that line of code for example here we can add a breakpoint by clicking in the left margin this red dot represents a breakpoint we can click it again to remove it so we insert a breakpoint now we start the application in the debug mode and the execution stops right here here to do that instead of clicking the play button we should click the debug button look at the shortcut its controll and d so i press contrl and d rerun our application in the debug mode okay our web server is listening on port 880 so now we go back to the browser and refresh this page so our home controller is hit so refresh okay here we are and the execution stopped right here on this highlighted line now this line is not executed yet we can execute it line by line using this tool over here step over the shortcut is f8 so if you press f8 this line is executed and now inside this little window we have the variables that are meaningful in the current context so we have this which is a reference to the current object which is home controller we also have view name which is set to index so using this window we can verify that our variables have the right values now if a variable is not detected here we can add an expression here for example view name and heres the result okay now we dont need this so lets remove it so this is how we can use step over now we can step over this line as well so we press f8 now we are inside the source code of the spring framework now this is not the actual source code this is the decompiled class but we dont care about this code because this is not part of our application we want to debug right so we want to continue execution until something is rendered in the browser to do that we have to use a different tool look at this button this is for resuming program the shortcut on mac is option command and r so im going to press these keys all right now all the code has been executed and here is the result now back to our home controller lets say we havent found the bug yet so we want to restart the debugging session again we press contrl and d now we go back to the browser and refresh this page so our home controller is hit but this time instead of stepping over this line were going to step into it maybe there is a problem with this method to do that we use this button over here step into the shortcut is f7 so we press f7 and now we are inside this method here we have only a single line of code we could have tens or hundreds of lines of code and this method could call other methods so again we could step over or step into those lines until we would find the source of the problem now in this case we know the problem is with the string literal that we are returning so lets change that to indexhtml now that were done we stop the debugger and remove this breakpoint we dont want to leave these break points all over the code because theyre going to get in the way in future debugging music sessions you have noticed that every time we change our code we have to rebuild our project but in spring boot we also have the automatic restart feature its not ideal its not as fast as automatic restart we have in node or react because there is a little bit of delay but let me show you how to set it up first we have have to go to our pom file now let me show you a cool shortcut here we can press shift command and o on mac or shift control and o on windows now over here we can search for our files so pal xml now here were going to add a dependency to do that we press command and n on mac or control and n on windows we select dependency and search for springboot das dev tools okay now look at this dependency from org springf framework boot so we add this to our project first we remove the version because this dependency is part of the spring framework so its better to allow the parent element determine the version of this dependency so lets delete this line instead we add another tag called optional and we set it to true that means this is not part of our application code its not going to be packaged with our application to be deployed in the production its only used during development okay now we have an error because this dependency does not exist in our local maven repository so we have to click this button to reload our project now maven downloaded this dependency good now to use this in intellig there are two settings we have to modify we go to the top on intellig ide menu we go to settings now on windows i think settings exist under file or edit menus okay regardless find the settings page now up here search for compiler now under build execution and deployment here under compiler check this box build project automatically thats the first setting theres one more setting we have to modify here on the top search for advanced settings right here under advanced settings check this box allow automake to start even if developed application is currently running so check this box all right now lets reassort our application all right with this in place every time we change our code after a small delay our application gets restarted lets see it in action so lets go back to our home controller and change indexhtml to index okay now after a few seconds our application gets restarted this is not ideal its not as fast as what we have in environments like node or react it is what it is but i thought to cover it in the course because a lot of people use this tool all right our application got restarted so back in the browser if you refresh we can see the homepage is broken so this is the def tools now i personally am not a fan of this tool so whenever i make changes i like to restart the application using control and r but going forward im going to check this box so this doesnt get in the way and we can quickly see the result now lets change this to indexhtml and move on to the next lesson in every application there are settings well need to configure like which port the application runs on database credentials or even custom settings for our application so lets see how we can configure our application properties here in the resources folder we have this file application properties we briefly talked about this before here we have a bunch of key value pairs some of them are standard like spring application name we have several standard properties like server port the default value is 8080 but we can change it to whatever we want and this will be the port our application will listen on im going to remove that we can also al define custom properties like app dot whatever like page size okay now to use this properties in our code we have to use the value annotation lets see how this works so first we go to our home controller to do that we press shift command and o on mac or shift control and o on windows lets go to our home controller okay now in this controller we want to define a private field and initialize it with the value of spring application name so lets declare a private field private string we can call that app name or whatever now we should annotate this with the value annotation we press enter so its imported on the top its defined in this package or springf framework beans factory annotation okay now as an argument we should pass a string with a special syntax first we type a dollar sign and inside braces we type the key of an application property in this case im going to copy this key spring application name now at runtime spring will get the value associated with this key and injected into our private field so now to see this in action we can use a print statement so systemout print line and here we can print the application name okay lets rerun our application and refresh the homepage okay now here on the console look app name is store one of the core features of the spring framework is dependency injection its a powerful concept that is used in real world applications in this section well start by breaking down what dependency injection is why its important and how it helps make your code cleaner and easier to maintain youll learn how to implement it using constructors and setters well then dive into how spring boot handles dependency injection using the ioc container youll see how to configure beans with annotations control which beans are selected when multiple options are available and externalized configurations to make your application more flexible finally will explore advanced topics like configuring beans programmatically using lazy initialization managing bean scopes and controlling the life cycle of your beans by the end of this section youll have a strong understanding of dependency injection and how spring uses it to manage the components of your application efficiently now lets jump in and get music started so what is dependency injection many students find this concept confusing or complex but its actually very simple lets break it down with a real word example imagine were building an ecommerce application we have an order service class that handles placing orders when an order is placed the customers payment needs to be processed so order service depends on a payment service like stripe payment service in this case we say order service is dependent on or coupled to strip payment service at first glance this might seem fine but lets talk about the issues that arise when one class is tightly coupled or dependent on another the first problem is that order service can only use stripe payment service if tomorrow we decide to switch to a different payment provider like paypal we would have to modify the order service code and once we change the order service class it has to be recompiled and retested which could impact other classes that depend on order service the second problem is that we cannot test order service in isolation because order service is tightly coupled to strip payment service we can test its logic separately from strip payment service now the problem here isnt that order service depends on strip payment service dependencies are normal in any application the issue we have here is about how the dependency is created and managed let me give you an analogy think of a restaurant a restaurant business needs a chef right so there is a dependency between the restaurant and the chef if the current chef becomes unavailable available the restaurant can hire another chef this kind of dependency is totally normal but what if we replace chef with john that means our restaurant is now dependent on jon a specific chef what if jon becomes unavailable we cant replace him with someone else and the restaurant will be in trouble this is an example of tight or bad coupling now back to our ecommerce application we dont want order service to be tightly coupled to a specific payment service like stripe thats like a restaurant being dependent on a specific chef instead we want order service to depend on a payment service which could be stripe paypal or any other provider to achieve this we can use an interface to decouple order service from strip payment service an interface in java is like a contract that defines the capabilities of a class it doesnt contain any implementation or logic it simply lists the methods or capabilities a class should have for example if order service depends on a payment service interface it doesnt know anything about stripe paypal or any other payment provider as long as these providers implement the payment service interface they can be used to handle payments and order service wouldnt care which one is being used so here are the benefits if you replace strip payment service with paypal payment service the order service class is not affected we dont need to modify or recompile order service also we can test order service in isolation without relying on a specific payment provider like stripee now with this setup we just have to give order service a particular implementation of payment service this is called dependency injection meaning well have to inject a dependency into a class just like how we can inject a drug into a body we can also inject an object into a class now there are a few different ways we can do this and were going to cover them over the next few lessons but first lets jump into the code and set up our example all right back to our project here in this package lets add a new class were going to call this order service now lets give it a method public void place order now in a real application we should pass an order object here but lets keep things simple and focus on dependency injection so no parameters now here we need to use a payment service like stripe so first we go back to our project and and add another class here stripe payment service now in this class we add a method public void process payment now in a real application we should pass a payment object here that encapsulates payment information like credit card details but again to keep things simple lets just add a simple parameter like a double here double amount now in this method lets add a print statement lets change the message to amount we just print the amount and right above that we add another print statement and say stripe now in the future we can create another payment service like paypal and in that class well print paypal okay now our order service needs to use strip payment service so back to this method here we declare variable payment service and set it to a new instance of stripe payment service then we call payment service process payment thats hardcode a value like 10 okay now this is our earlier setup before we introduce an interface to decouple these two classes so in this implementation the order service class is dependent or tightly coupled to stripe payment service so that means we cannot test order service in isolation because whenever we want to test that we have to bring in strip payment service and also if in the future we decide to switch to a different provider like paypal well have to modify the order service class as a result of this the class has to be recompiled retested and this can propagate to several other classes in our application so this is where we use an interface to decouple or order service from stripe payment service to do that we go back to our stripe payment service on the top under the refactor menu go to extract and then interface now on this dialog box first we specify our interface name were going to use a more general name so we remove stripe and just call this payment service we leave it in the same package and then down here we select the method that we want to include in the interface by default its not selected so make sure to select it and then click refactor now intellig is saying that this interface has been successfully created its asking if you want to proceed yes and then it says use interface where possible this is called programming against interfaces okay lets go ahead look what happened now strip payment service implements payment service lets take a look here so we hold down command on mac or control on windows and click here this is our interface as you can see this interface has no implementation there is no logic here no algorithm all we have is a method declaration or a capability this is like a chef that can cook but how they cook we dont know that is dependent on the implementation okay now with this setup we have to modify order service so instead of being coupled to strip payment service it should be coupled to payment service well do that next one way and the recommended way to inject a dependency into a class is via constructor so here in the order service lets define a constructor public order service we press tab to complete the code now we should pass our dependency as an argument to this constructor so first we give it a parameter of type payment service we press tab and tab again so we receive a payment service object here now we should store this in a field in this class so we can use it in the place order method so we can declare a private field private payment service tab and then initialize it in the constructor intellig automatically detected the code we want to write so we can just press tab and here it is so when creating an order service we pass a payment service object we store it in a field in this class which is declared up here and then in the place order method instead of using strip payment service we use the payment service object that we have in this class this is our setup now to see this in action we should go back to our project and go to the store application class were going to take a break from spring so were going to comment out this line so instead of running a spring application were going to run a console application so here in the main method first we declare a variable called order service then we set it to a new order service now here in the constructor we have to pass a payment service this is our chance to inject a dependency into the order service class so we can pass a new strip payment service or in the future we can pass a different payment service like paypal okay now we can call order service place order lets run our application all right look we are using stripe to process 10 now lets create a new payment service so in this package we add a new java class called paypal payment service now here we say this class implements payment service so we press tab to complete the code now we have an error because this class is not implementing the methods declared in this interface so we can press alt and enter and here we select implement methods in this dialog box we can see all the methods declared in our payment service interface by default this is selected otherwise we have to select it and then we click okay so heres our implementation now to save time im going to go back to our stripe payment service copy these two lines and paste them in our paypal class we just have to change stripe to paypal okay now with this change we can go back to our store application and when creating a new order service we can give it a new paypal payment service now if you run the application we can see that paypal was used to process 10 but heres the interesting part as a result of supporting paypal payments we didnt have to modify our order service so we extended our application by creating new classes instead of modifying existing ones in objectoriented programming this is called open closed principle its a very important principle in building maintainable software the open close principle says that a class should be open for extension but closed from modification in other words we should be able to add new functionality to a class without changing its existing code now why is this important because by avoiding changes to existing code we can reduce the risk of introducing bugs and breaking other parts of the application now of course this is just a guideline it doesnt mean we need to blindly apply it everywhere in our application like any principle its something we should strive for when it makes sense and adds value now you might have seen people like our famous rockstar developer mr john smith who hate objectoriented programming one reason might be that they read principles like the open close principle in a book applied them blindly to every corner of their application and ended up with an over engineered mess and of course instead of blaming their own misuse of the principles they blame objectoriented programming itself the takeaway here is that principles like the open close principles are tools not rules theyre meant to guide you in building flexible and maintainable software but you should always use them with common sense music another way to inject a dependency into a class is via a setter so here in the order service class were going to define a setter for setting the payment service now we can type that setter by hand or we can have intelligate generated for us first we put the cursor on the field name then we press command and n on mac or control and n on windows to bring up the generate context menu here we select setter enter and proceed all right heres our new setter so this setter gets a payment service and sets the payment service field in this class now i dont like that intellig inserts the generated code on the top because by convention we put getters and setters in the bottom so let me show you another cool shortcut for moving this code first we put the cursor on the method declaration on the first line now we hold hold down shift and command on mac or shift and control on windows now by pressing the down or up arrows we can move this method around okay im going to move it to the bottom so here it is now to use this we go back to our store application here we call order service do set payment service and pass new paypal payment service now of course this looks a little bit ugly because we dont want to pass the payment service twice so it would be better to remove the payment service from constructor and then pass it to the setter so back to our order service we can remove or comment out this constructor the shortcut to do that is command and slash on mac or control and slash on windows okay now back to our store application we create an order service we set the payment service and then then place the order now theres a problem with this code can you tell heres the problem what if we forget to set the payment service now if you run our application it crashes we have a null pointer exception so we should use this approach for optional dependencies in other words our order service should be able to do its job without having that external dependency in this case a payment service is not an optional dependency its a required dependency so it doesnt make sense to injected bya setter again for the most part constructor injection is the more common and the recommended way to inject dependencies so far we have been manually creating a payment service and passing it to order service while this works for simple examples it quickly becomes a headache as our application grows what if paypal payment service has its own dependencies we would have to create more objects and wire them together managing all of this manually can get messy tedious and aror prone this is where spring comes to the rescue one of the core features of the spring framework is its ability to create objects and inject them into our classes automatically at the core of the spring framework we have what we call an ioc container well talk about ioc in a minute but this container is responsible for managing the objects in our application in spring terminology we refer to this manage object objects as beans so a bean is just a regular java object that is managed by a spring spring takes care of creating it injecting its dependencies and even managing its life cycle now what is ioc about well ioc is short for inversion of control the name comes from the fact that it inverts the control of creating objects and managing dependencies in a traditional application we are in control we write the code to create objects and manage dependencies but with the ioc container we hand over that control to spring lets see this in action so im going to bring back this line now this run method returns an object of type application context application context is our ioc container its a storage for our objects so we can store the result in an object of type application context that is defined in this package or springframework doc context so we import it and call this object context now this context has a method called get bean with this method we can get a bean or an object that is managed by a spring in this case we need a being of type order service right so as an argument we pass order service do class okay then we store the result in order service so instead of us manually creating objects and injecting tencies we let spring take care of that for us so lets remove this line okay now lets run our application all right our application crashed with an exception of type no such being definition exception the message says no qualifying being of type order service available in other words spring doesnt know how to create an instance of order service there are two ways we can solve this issue well talk about about them music next there are two ways we can tell spring about objects it should manage for us one way is using annotations and thats what were going to cover in this lesson there is another way using code which well look at later in this section so back to our main method look here we need to get a be of type order service so we want spring to manage objects of type order service to do that we go to our order service class and annotate this with an annotation called component this is defined in org springf framework stereotype so lets press enter so this is imported on the top okay so with the component annotation we tell spring to manage objects of type order service now component is a general purpose annotation we have other specialized annotations like service for classes that contain business logic we have repository for classes that interact with the database we have another annotation that you have seen before and thats controller this is used for markting classes as controllers for handling web requests so back to our code order service is a service class so here we can also use the service annotation now technically service is just an alias for the component so theres really no difference between the two let me show you what i mean so hold down command on mac or control on windows and click service look at the implementation look service is an alias4 component so we can use either of these annotations but the component annotation is often used for utility classes we use service for classes that contain business logic now look down here we have an error saying could not autowire no beans of payment service type found what this error is saying is that order service needs a payment service but payment service is an interface so spring doesnt know how to create instances of the payment service interface to solve this problem we have to go to the paypal payment service class and annotate this with either component or service now technically we should do the same with the stripe payment service but dont do that in this lesson because thats going to cause an issue that well talk about later in this section okay so we simply annotated two classes with service now if you run our application we can see that paypal was used to process 10 beautiful now there is another annotation you need to be familiar with and that is autowired lets go back to our order service class so here we have a constructor that takes a payment service now in the past we had to annotate this constructor with autowired to tell spring to autowire this object with its dependencies but going forward this is not necessary if our class has a single constructor so in this case we can comment this out and everything works but you might see the autowired annotation in a lot of older code bases now if you have multiple constructors here we have to use autowired let me show you this in action so im going to temporarily comment this out now lets create a default constructor order service now if you run our application our application crashes with a null pointer exception because in this example spring prefers to use the default constructor with no arguments and as a result payment service will remain uninitialized to solve this problem we have to bring back the autowired annotation now when we run our application everything works as expected because we have told spring to autowire this class with its dependencies okay now what if we have another constructor but not a default constructor so lets add payment service here and give it a second parameter like int x it doesnt really matter now look what happens if you remove the auto annotation right away we can see an error here saying class doesnt contain matching constructor for auto wirring but lets run the application and see the error we get because thats a very common error in spring applications so lets run this one more time all right now we got an exception of type bean creation exception and the message is error creating bean with the name order service this is a very common exception so to solve this issue again we have to bring autowire back so bring auto wires this class with its dependencies lets run our application one more time problem is solved so lets remove this other constructor as well as the autowire out ation and move on to the next lesson if you found this useful imagine what you will learn in my full spring wood course as i said the full course has two parts but each part about 6 hours long it covers a whole lot more and is packed with exercises to make you a job ready developer click the link

course youre going to learn everything about python from basics to more advanced concepts so by the end of the course youll be able to confidently use python for ai machine learning web development and automation if you have been looking for a comprehensive easy to follow well organized and practical course that takes you from zero to hero this is the right python course for you you dont need any prior knowledge of python to get started i will explain everything step by step in simple terms so you can build a solid foundation im m hamadani a software engineer with over 20 years of experience and ive taught millions how to code and become professional software engineers through my youtube channel and online school quote withm marcom if youre new here make sure to subscribe as i upload new videos all the time now lets jump in and get started in this course youre going to learn everything you need to get started with python just be aware that ive designed this course for beginners so if you have some programming experience check out my other python course for developers you can see the link on the top right corner of this video so python is the worlds fastest growing and most popular programming language not just amongst software developers but also amongst mathematicians data analysts scientists accountants network engineers and even kids kids in fact its the ideal programming language to learn first but what makes python so special here are six reasons with python you can solve complex problems in less time with fewer lines of code than many other languages thats why huge companies like google spotify dropbox and facebook have embraced this beautiful and powerful language here is an example lets say we want to extract the first three characters of the text hello work this is the code we would have to write in c this is how we would do this in javascript and heres how we would do it in python see how clean and simple the language is and thats just the beginning python is a multipurpose language and you can use it for a wide range of jobs such as data analysis ai and machine learning writing automation scripts building web mobile and desktop applications as well as software testing or even hacking so if you want a highpaying long lasting career in any of these areas especially ai and machine learning python is the language to put those opportunities at your fingertips in fact according to indeedcom the average salary of a python developer in the us was over 115000 in march 2018 and here are four more reasons that make python the most desirable language python is a highle language so you dont have to worry about complex tasks such as memory management as you do in c its crossplatform which means we can build and run python apps on windows mac and linux it has a huge community so whenever you get stuck there is someone out there to help and it has a large ecosystem of libraries frameworks and tools whatever you want to do it is likely that someone else has done it before because because python has been around for over 20 years there are two versions of python out there python 2 which is the legacy version of python and is going to be supported until year 2020 and python 3 which is python for the future in this course youre going to learn python 3 hi my name is msh hamadani and im going to be your instructor in this course im a software engineer with 18 years of experience and ive taught way over a million people how to codee or how to become top professional software engineers to learn more about me and my courses head over to cod withcom all right now lets get started all right the first thing i want you to do is open your browser and head over to pythonorg on this page under downloads you can download the latest version of python at the time of this video the latest version is python 313 chances are in the future when youre watching this video there is a new newer version of python available dont worry what im going to show you in this tutorial will apply to future versions of python as well so go ahead and download the latest version now if youre on windows before you click install make sure to check this little box here that says add python to path this step is very important and it will save you a lot of headaches later so check this box and follow the installation now to verify that python is successfully installed click this magnifier and and here in this search bar type terminal now here in the terminal window type python d version this verifies that we have successfully installed python 313 now if youre on mac press command and space to bring up the spotlight search here type terminal now to verify that we have installed python correctly on mac we should type python 3 space version so as you can see ive successfully installed python 313 on this machine so this environment you see here is what we call python interpreter which is basically a program that executes python code we can type our python code in a file and give it to this interpreter or we can type our code directly here in this interactive shell so here we can write an expression like two 2 in programming an expression is a piece of code that produces a value so here when we add 2 2 we get a value that is why we refer to this piece of code as an expression so enter we get four lets try a different kind of expression lets see if two is greater than one we get true which is an example of a boolean value youre going to learn about these boolean values in the next section now what if we type two is greater than five enter we get false so in programming we have true and false which are similar to yes and no in english now what if we type two is greater than but we dont add a second value here just press enter we get a syntax error in programming syntax means grammar so just like we have the concept of grammar in the languages that we speak we have the exact same concept in programming if we write a sentence that is not grammatically correct chances are some people may not understand that sentence so in this example we have this expression which is incomplete it doesnt have the right grammar or syntax that is why python interpreter is complaining by returning an error so this interactive shell is a great way to quickly experiment with a bit of python code but thats not how we build real world applications to do that we need a code editor and thats what im going to show you in the next lecture music when it comes to typing python code you have two options you can use a code editor or an ide which is short for integrated development environment an ide is basically a code editor with some fancy features like autoc completion which means as you type code this feature helps you complete your code so you dont have to type every character by hand its a per activity boosting feature it also gives you additional features like debugging which means finding and fixing bugs in your programs testing and so on for both code editors and ides theres so many options out there the most popular code editors are vs code atom and sublime you can use the code editor that you prefer in terms of the ides again there are so many options out there the most popular one is pie charm in this course im going to use vs code or visual studio code because thats my favorite code editor later in the course i will show you how to install a plugin or an extension that will convert vs code to a powerful id so before going any further head over to code visual studiocom and download the latest version of vs code now with vs code open on the top from the file menu go to to open and somewhere on your disk create a new folder lets call this folder hello world and then open it beautiful now click this icon on the top this opens up the explorer panel in this panel you can see all the files and folders in your project so lets add a new file and call that apppy so all our python files should have the p my extension press enter now lets close this and type a bit of python code in this lecture were going to use one of the builtin functions in python called print so in python we have a lot of builin functions for performing various kinds of tasks for example as a metaphor think of the remote control of your tv on this remote control you have a bunch of functions like turn on turn off change the channel change the volume and so on these are the build buin functions in your tv we have the same concept in python and many other programming languages so one of these builtin functions that comes with python is print and we can use this to print something on the screen now whenever you want to use a function you should open and close parentheses in programming we say were calling the print function calling a function means executing it now lets display the hello world message on the screen whenever you want to work with text you should put your text in between quotes either double quotes or single quote now im going to go with double quote and add hello world and then put a happy persian cat here beautiful save the changes with command and s on mac or control and s on windows now to execute this code we need to go back to command prompt on windows or terminal on mac but the good news is that we dont have to switch programs here in vs code we have an integrated terminal so press control and back tick that is the key before number one on your keyboard that is just below the escape button so this is our integrated terminal now if youre on windows type python if youre on mac or linux type python 3 and next to that add the name of our file that is app p and heres our hello word message in the terminal beautiful now lets take this to the next level and make it a little bit more interesting lets close this terminal window by pressing control and back tick and add a second line of code so one more time print this time lets add quotes with a star in between them now lets say you want to repeat this star 10 times so here we can multiply this is by 10 save the changes open up the terminal and run our program and you can see this star is repeated 10 times so as you see the instructions in our program are executed from top to bottom in order in the next lecture im going to show you how to convert this vs code to a powerful ide for building python applications music in this lecture im going to show you how to convert vs code to a powerful ide by using an extension called python with this extension or plugin we get a number of features such as linting which basically means analyzing our code for potential errors we also get debugging which involves finding and fixing errors well look at this later in the course we also get autoc completion which basically helps us write code faster so we dont have to type every character we get code formatting which is all about making our code clean and readable just like how we format our articles newspapers books to make them clean and readable we get unit testing which involves writing a bunch of tests for our code we can run these tests in an automated fashion to make sure our code is behaving correctly and finally we get code snippets which are reusable code blocks that we can quickly generate so we dont have to type them all by hand now dont worry about memorizing any of these as we go through the course youre going to learn about these features so back to vs code on the left side click this icon this opens the extensions panel where we can install additional extensions to enhance vs code up here in the search bar search for python all right look we have an official extension for python from microsoft so go ahead and install this now you might see a box here saying reload if you see that make sure to click it to reload vs code now with this extension installed we have a ton of new functionality in vs code for writing python code the first one im going to show you in this lesson is the ability to run our code so back to apppy look with this extension installed now we have this play icon on the top for running our code so if we click it we can see the output of our program in the terminal window in this lecture im going to show you linting and action so lets start by writing some invalid code like this print space with no parenthesis and then hello world earlier i told you that print is a builtin function and whenever you want to use or call a function you should always use parenthesis now to be more precise this is actually valid python 2 code but because were using python 3 here this is invalid code from python 3s point of view so now when i save the changes you can see this red underline here lets hover our mouse over this underline you can see this tool tip its coming from pilot and heres the error message missing parenthesis in call to print did you mean print with parenthesis so this is the benefit of lenting as youre writing code you can see potential problems in your code you dont have to wait to run your program to see these errors so now if we put parenthesis here and save the changes you can see that red underline is gone lets look at another error lets type two plus and then save the changes earlier we run this code in python interpreters interactive shell there we got a syntax or grammar error so if you hover your mouse here one more time you can see pilent is telling us that this is invalid syntax or invalid grammar its like an incomplete sentence so this is linting an action now let me show you a couple useful shortcuts here on the top look at the view menu here we have this problems menu look at the shortcut on mac its shift command and m on windows its probably shift control m so as youre working with vs code try to memorize these shortcuts because they really help you write code faster now lets take a look at this problems panel so this problems panel lists all the issues in your code in one place so if you have an application with multiple files this is really useful because some of those files may not currently be open so this linter pilent will analyze all your files and if it finds any issues it will list them here in the problems panel now you can also put this on the right side of the screen so lets put it here so so as you write code these problems will appear here now lets fix this issue so im going to add three here save the changes and you can see the problem disappeared and one last thing before we finish this lecture once again on the top lets go to the view menu the first item is command pallet this is a very important feature in vs code once again look at the shortcut that is shift command and p on mac or shift control p on windows with this command pallet you can execute various commands in vsod if you type lint here you can see all commands related to linting as you can see all these commands are prefixed with python because these commands come with the python extension that we installed earlier so these are additional features available to us in vs code the first command here is select linter in this list you can see various linters available for p pent so as youre reading tutorials or talking to other people you will hear about linters such as flake 8 my pie pep 8 and so on different developers prefer different linters i personally prefer py lint that is the most popular one and that is the default linter set and the python extension of vs code if youre adventurous you can try using other linters on your own the difference between these linters is in how they find and report errors some error messages are more meaningful or more friendly the others are more ambiguous so thats all about linting in the next lecture well talk about formatting code in python community we have a bunch of documents called python enhancement proposals or peps here on google if you search for python peps you can see the list of all these ps under pythonorg sdev peps lets have a quick look here so here are the peps you can see each pep has a number and a title the one that is very popular amongst python developers is pep 8 which is a style guide for python code a style guide is basically a document that defines a bunch of rules for formatting and styling our code if you follow these conventions the code that you right will end up being consistent with other peoples code now if you have time you can go ahead and read this pep eight documentation but if not dont worry because throughout this course im going to explain the key things in pep 8 in this lecture im going to show you a tool that helps you automatically format your code according to pep 8 so back in vs code lets write some python code x equal 1 here im declaring a variable and setting it to one if if youre not familiar with variables dont worry in the next section youre going to learn about them so according to pep 8 this code is considered ugly because by convention we should add a space around this equal sign or the assignment operator now since youre starting out with python you probably dont know these rules so let me show you a tool that helps you automatically format your code lets revert this back to its original state now we need to go back to the command pallet remember so its right here under view and the shortcut is shift command and p here if you search for format you can see this command format document the first time you execute this command youre going to see this message here formatter autopep8 is not installed so there are a bunch of tools for formatting python code the most popular one is auto pep 8 and this is the tool that this python extension we installed uses to format our our code now if you dont see this you can install autopep8 using the extensions panel so once again on the left side click this icon and search for auto pep 8 there it is lets install it good so lets go ahead and install this good now one more time lets open up the command pallet and execute format document see this tool automatically formats our code beautiful lets take a look at another example im going to declare another variable y and set it to two and a variable with a long name like unit underline price and we set this to three now some developers have this habit of formatting their variable declarations like this so they put all these equal signs in the same column according to pep 8 this is considered ugly so once again lets format our code that is better beautiful now let me show you a trick opening up this command palet and searching for format document every time is a little bit timec consuming so im going to show you how to have your file automatically formatted as soon as you save the changes on the top lets go to the code menu preferences and settings here in the search box search for for format on save so we have this option editor format on save take this now back to apppy im going to change the formatting of these lines make them really ugly now as soon as i save the changes you can see my code is reformatted music beautiful all right now lets talk about a few different ways to run python code as i told you before one way to run python code is by opening the terminal window if youre on windows type python if youre on mac type python 3 followed by the name of the file this approach is useful in situations where you dont have access to a code editor okay now with the python extension in vs code there is a simpler way to run python code we get this play button on the top when we click it we see the output in the terminal but clicking this button every time we change our code is a little bit tedious so let me show you how to associate a shortcut to this button first we close this next we bring up the command pallet the shortcut on mac is shift command and p on windows is shift control p here we search for open keyboard shortcuts look we have this command up here now on this window we can see all the commands in vs code and the shortcuts associated with them here in the search bar search for run python file okay so this is the command that is associated with the play button as you can see we dont currently have any key bindings or shortcuts here so double click in this column now here you can press any key combination for creating a shortcut im going to press controll and r okay now we press enter with this in place we can go back to apppy and press controlr and here we see the out beautiful when we talk about python we mean two separate things that are closely related python language and a particular implementation python as a language is just a specification that defines a set of rules and grammar for writing python code a python implementation is basically a program that understands those rules and can execute python code earlier in the course we downloaded python from py pythonorg this is the default implementation of python called cpython its a program written in c thats why its called c python so here in terminal when we run python we get this c python this is the default implementation of python there are a few other implementations out there such as jython written in java iron python written in c and piie written in a subset of python itself as new features are added to the the python language they are first supported by cpython because thats the default implementation and then they will gradually come to the other implementations in theory if we give some python code to any of these implementations we should get the same result but in practice thats not always the case certain features may be available in one implementation but not another or they may just behave a little bit differently in a particular implementation now you might ask what is the point of this why do we have several implementations of python wouldnt c python be enough well its for the same reason that we have multiple operating systems or multiple browsers or multiple programming languages after all these years we programmers havent agreed on a single programming language and thats the same story with python implementations however there is one technical reason behind these implementations that you should be aware of since jyon is implemented in java it allows you to reuse some existing java code in a python program so if youre a java developer and you want to import some java code into a python program you should use jython instead of cpython similarly iron python is written in c so if youre a c developer and want to bring some c code into a python program you will have to use iron python next well look at how exactly cpython executes python code music the programming languages we use like c c java python these are all simple text based languages that we humans understand computers dont understand them they only understand machine code so if we have some code written in c we should convert it to machine code and thats the job of a c compiler so a c compiler is a program that knows how to convert or compile c code into machine code however this machine code is specific to the type of cpu of a computer so if we compile a c program on a windows machine we cant execute it on a mac because windows and mac have different machine code just like how people from different countries speak different languages java came to solve this problem java compiler doesnt compile java code into machine code instead it compiles it into a portable language called jav java bite code which is not specific to a hardware platform like windows or mac now we still need to convert java bite code to machine code so java also comes with a program called java virtual machine or jvm for doing this when we run a java program jvm kicks in it loads our java bite code and then at runtime it will convert each instruction to machine code with this model we can run java bite code on any platforms that have a jvm we have jvm implementations for windows mac and so on so the jvm implementation on windows knows how to convert java bite code into machine code that a windows machine can understand c and python have also taken the same route so they are platform independent when we run a python program using cpython first it will compile our python code into python bite code then it will pass that bite code to python virtual machine which will in turn convert it into machine code and execute it this is how cpython works in the last lecture we talked about various python implementations i told you that if you want to reuse some java code in a python program you should use jython now lets see how jython makes this possible when you use jython to run a python program instead of compiling your python code into python by code it will compile it to java by code so we can take this java bite code and run it using java virtual machine and thats why you can import some java code into a python program when using jython because the end result is java bite code which will eventually be executed by java virtual music machine so ive got a few questions for you cuz i want to see if you have been really paying attention to this video or not you better have so heres the first question for for each question i want you to pause the video think about the answer for a few seconds when youre ready continue watching so heres the first question what is an expression an expression is a piece of code that produces a value heres an example of an expression what do you think is the value of this expression well here we have this string were multiplying this by three so the result will be a string of three asterisk like this heres another question what is a syntax error a syntax error is a kind of error that is due to bad syntax or bad grammar in the code and finally the last question what does a linter do a linter is a tool that checks our code for potential errors mostly in the category of syntactical errors so if you have grammatical issues in our code the linter will tell us before running our program okay okay thats it for now if you like more quizzes and programming exercises look at the link below this video and if you have enjoyed this video i hope you have please support me by giving a thumbs up please like this video and share it with others in the next section were going to look at the fundamentals of music python hey guys i just wanted to let you know that this tutorial is actually the first two hours of my complete python mastery course if youre finding this helpful and want to dive even deeper the the full course covers everything from beginner basics to advanced concepts like machine learning web development and automation youll also get handson projects to build your skills step by step i put the link in the description box if youre ready to take your python knowledge to the next level now lets continue lets start this section by a discussion of variables which are one of the core concepts in programming we use variables to store data in computers memory here are a few examples im going to define a variable called students underline count and setting it to a th000 when we run this program python interpreter will allocate some memory and store this number thousand in that memory space then it will have this variable reference that memory location so this variable is just like a label for that memory location we can use this variable or this label anywhere in our program program to get access to that memory location and the data stored there so now if we print students count and run our program we will get the number thousand so this is the basic of variables now what kind of data can we store in computers memory well we have several different kinds of data in this section were going to look at the builtin primitive types in python primitive types can be numbers booleans and strings let me show you so here we have a whole number we refer to this as an integer in programming we can also have numbers with a decimal point lets take a look so rating we set this to 499 this is what we call a float or a floating point number and this terminology is not specific to python in the future when you learn a new programming language youre going to hear these terms again now lets take a look at an example of a boolean is published we set this to true or false these are examples of boolean values in programming so boolean values can either be true or false and these are exactly like yes and no in english later in the course you will learn that well use these boolean values to make decisions in our programs for example if the user is an admin user perhaps we want to give them extra permissions so these are the boolean values now take into account that python is a case sensitive language which means lowercase and uppercase characters have different meanings so boolean values should always start with a capital letter like what you see here if we type false or false these are not accepted boolean values in python only what you see here is a valid boolean value so false or true and finally lets take a look at an example of a string so of course underline name we set this to a string like python programming so a string as i told you before is like text whenever you want to work with text in your programs you need to surround your text with quotes so these are the basics of variables so these are the variables from the last lecture now ive got a question for you there are four things that ive consistently used in this program can you spot them if you want you can pause the video think about this for a few seconds and then continue watching so here are those four things the first thing is that all my variable names are descriptive and meaningful so students count represents the number of students for a course or course name clearly explains that this variable holds the name of a course one of the issues that i see a lot amongst beginner programmers is that they use mystical names for their variables something like this cn as in short for course name when someone else reads this code they have no idea what cn stands for or they use variable names like c1 when i look at that code i wonder where is c2 and what is the difference between c1 and c2 so these variable names are very mystical thats a bad practice make sure your variable names are always descriptive and meaningful because this makes your code more maintainable now there are times that you can use short variable names like x y z if youre dealing with things like coordinates so thats an exception now the second thing that i have consistently used in this code is that i have used lowercase letters to name my variables so here we dont have course name all in capital or in title case all letter are lowercase right lets delete this the third thing that ive consistently used here is that i have used an underscore to separate multiple words and ive done this to make my variable names more readable because in python we cannot have a space in variable names so we cannot have course name and if you put these two words together its a little bit hard to read thats why we use an underscore and the fourth thing that i have used consistently here is that i have put a space around this equal sign again thats one of the issues i see a lot amongst beginners they write code like this this is a little bit ugly this is what we call dirty code dirty stinky smelly you should write code that is clean and beautiful so other people can read it like a story like a newspaper article it should be formatted properly and thats why we have pep 8 in python now the good thing is if you forget these rules when you save the changes autopep8 kicks in and it automatically reformats your code but that aside you should always give yourself the habit of writing clean code without relying too much on the tooling so these are all the best practices about naming your variables next were going to look at strings in more detail so here we have this course variable set to python programming as i told you before whenever you work with text you should surround your text with quotes you can either use double quotes or single quotes thats more of a personal preference but quite often we use double quotes we also have triple quotes and we use them to format a long string for example if you have lets say a variable message that is the message we want to include in the body of an email you can use triple quotes to format it like this hi john this is msh from code with mcom blah blah blah so thats when we use triple codes now we dont need this in this lecture so delete let me show you a few useful things you can do with strings first of all we have this builtin function in python for getting the length of strings what is a function a function is basically bally a reusable piece of code that carries out a task as a metaphor think of the remote control of your tv on this remote control you have buttons for different functions like turn on turn off change the channel and so on these are the builtin functions in your tv in python and many other programming languages we have the exact same concept so we have functions that are built into the language on the platform you can reuse these functions to perform various tasks so here we can use the builtin len function to get the length of a string which means the number of characters in that string now whenever you want to use a function you should use parenthesis now we say were calling this function which basically means were using this function now some functions take additional data which we refer to as arguments these arguments are inputs to these functions so this len function takes an input or an argument here we pass our course variable and this will return the number of characters in this string so lets print that and see what we get run the program we get 18 because we have 18 characters here lets look at another example if you want to get access to a specific character in this string you use the square bracket notation so here we add course square bracket brackets to get the first character you use the index zero so in python like many other languages strings are zero index which means the index of the first character or the first element is zero so now when we print this well get p okay now you can also use a negative index like minus1 what does that mean well if zero represents the first character here what do you think negative 1 represents that takes us back to the end of the string so that returns the first character from the end of the string lets draun this program you will see well get g there you go using a similar syntax you can slice strings let me show you so im going to duplicate this line and remove ne1 now lets say we want to extract the first three characters in this string so here we need two indexes the start index colon the end index so this will return a new string that contains the first three characters in this course variable that would be p y and t so the index of these characters are zero 1 and two so that means the character at the end index is not included okay lets run the program and make sure we get the right result there you go pyt now what if we dont include the end index what do you think were going to get its common sense we start from index zero and go all the way to the end of the string so this will return a new string that is exactly the same as the original string lets take a look so we get python programming now what if we dont include the start index but include the end index what do you think were going to get once again its common sense so by default python will put zero here so it will start from the beginning of the string so when i run this program we should get pyt one more time there you go and finally as the last example if we dont include the start and the end index this will return a copy of of the original string lets look at this so we get python programming now you dont have to memorize any of these just remember we use the len function to get the length of a string we use bracket notation to get access to a specific element or a specific character and we use this notation to slice a string so we have this string here python pro programming now lets say we want to put a double quote in the middle of this string there is a problem here python interpreter sees this second string as the end of the string so the rest of the code is meaningless and invalid how do we solve this problem well there are two ways one way is to use single cotes for our string and then we can use a double code in the middle of the string but what if for whatever reason perhaps for being consistent in our code we decided to use double quotes how can we add another double code in the middle of this string well we can prefix this with a backs slash backslash in python strings is a special character we have a jargon for that called escape character we use it to escape the character after let me show you what i mean so lets lets print this course and run this program whats going on here we dont have the backs slash because we use that to escape this double code and basically display it here so backs slash is an escape character and back sl double quote is an escape sequence in python strings we have a few other escape sequences that you should be aware of let me show you so in python we use a hash sign to indicate a comment a comment is like additional note that we add to our program its not executed by python interpreter okay so here are the escape sequences you have seen back sl double quote we also have back sl single code so we can use that to add a single code here lets run the program here it is beautiful we also have double backs slash so if you want to include a backslash in your strings you should prefix it with another backslash let me show you so when we run this we get python one back slash programming and finally we have back sln which is short for new line so now if i add a back slash n here see what we get we get a new line after python so programming will end up on the second line so these are the escape sequences in python here we have two variables first and last lets say we want to print my full name on the console so we can define another variable full set it to first then concatenate it with a space and one more time concatenate it with last now when we print full we get my full name on the console beautiful now this approach of using concatenation to build a string is okay but there is a better and newer approach we can use formatted strings so here we can set full to this string and prefix it with an f which can be lowercase or uppercase this formatted string doesnt have a constant value like these two strings here its actually an expression that will be evaluated at runtime so here we want to add our first name we use curly braces to print the value of the first variable after that we add a space and then we add curly braces one more time to print the last name so at run time this expression will be evaluated what we have in between curly braces will be replaced at runtime now lets run this program one more time we get the exact same result just be aware that you can put any valid expressions in between curly braces so earlier you learned about the builtin len function we can call len here to get the length of this string lets run this program one more time so we get four we can also replace last with an expression like this 2 2 lets run this program we get four and four so when using formatted strings you can put any valid expressions in between curly braces in this lecture were going to look at a few useful functions available to work with strings so earlier you learned about this builtin len function this function is general purpose so its not limited to strings later i will show you how to use this function with other kind of objects but in python we have quite a few functions that are specific to a strings let me show you so here if we type course dot see all these are functions available on strings now in precise terms we refer to these functions as methods this is a term in objectoriented programming that you will learn about later in the course for now now what i want you to take away is that everything in python is an object and objects have functions we call methods that we can access using the dot notation so here course is an object we use the dot notation to access its functions or more accurately methods lets take a look at a few of these methods we have upper to convert a string to uppercase now lets print this and run the program heres what we get beautiful now note that the methods that you call here return a new string so the original string is not affected let me show you so print course run the program one more time look this is our original string right so course upper returns a new string a new value we can store it in a variable like course underline capital like this now to keep this demo simple and consistent im going to revert this back and use a print statement we also have the lower method to convert a string to lowercase we also have title which will capitalize the first letter of every word so if our string was like this when we call the title method we get python programming as you see here okay another useful method is strip and we use it to trim any white space at the beginning or end of a string this is particularly useful when we receive input from the user let me show you so lets imagine the user entered a couple of white spaces at the beginning of this string when we call course strip those white spaces will be removed take a look so note that in the first three examples we have the those white spaces but in the last one it is removed so a strip removes the white space from both the beginning and end of a string we also have l strip which is short for left strip and r strip which is short for right strip so it will remove the white space from the end of a string if you want to get the index of a character or a sequence of characters in your string you should use the find method and me show you so of course find so as an argument here we pass another string we can pass a character or a series of characters lets find the index of pro run the program so the index of pro is nine so if we start from zero here all the way to nine this is the index of pro okay now as i told you before python is a case sensitive language so if i pass a capital p here obviously we dont have these exact characters in our string so lets see what we get we get 1 that means this string was not found in the original string another useful method is replace so we call replace with this we can replace a character or a sequence of characters with something else so lets say we want to replace all lowercase ps with j with this we get jython durog gramming whatever that means and finally if you want to check for the existence of a character or a sequence of characters in your string you can use the in operator let me show you so print we write an expression like this pro in course so this is an expression as i told you before an expression is a piece of code that produces a value so this expression checks to see if we have pro in course the difference between this expression and calling the fine method is that the fine method returns the index of these characters in our string but as this expression returns a boolean so its a true or false let me show you so run the program we get the boolean true and finally we have the not operator and we use that to see if our string does not contain a character or a sequence of characters so lets change this to swift not in course when this expression is evaluated what do you think were going to get well we dont have swift in this string so not in will return true lets take a look there you go go so these are the useful string methods next well look at numbers in python we have three types of numbers two of these you have already seen before they are integers and floats we also have complex numbers so complex numbers in math are in the form a plus b i where i is the imaginary number number now if youre not familiar with this concept dont worry this is something that is used a lot in mathematics and electrical engineering if you want to use python to build web applications youre never going to use complex numbers but let me quickly show you the syntax for representing complex numbers instead of i we use j so here is an example 1 2 j so x now is a complex number and by the way as i told you before this is just a common or an additional note in our program when we run this program anything after this h sign will be ignored so these are the three types of numbers we have in python for all these types of numbers we have the standard arithmetic operations that we have in math let me show you so we have addition subtraction multiplication division but we actually have two different types of divisions let me show you first lets run this program so with this division operator which is a slash we get a floating point number if you want an integer you use double slashes let me show you so double slash run the program we get three okay we also have modulus which is the remainder of a division and finally exponent which is less left to the power of right so 10 to the power of 3 will be a th000 these are the standard arithmetic operators now for all these operators we have a special operator called augmented assignment operator let me show you so lets imagine we have x set to 10 we want to increment x by lets say three we can write an expression like this x x 3 or we can use an augmented assignment operator that is a little bit shorter so we write x equal three these two statements are exactly the same now here im using addition as an example you can use any of these operators here next im going to show you some useful functions to work with numbers in this lecture were going to look at a few few useful functions to work with numbers so we have this builtin function round for rounding a number so if we pass 29 here and print the result we will get three we have another useful builtin function called abs which returns the absolute value of a number so if we pass 29 here well get positive 29 now teic we have only a handful of builtin functions to work with numbers if you want to write a program that involves complex mathematical calculations you need to use the math module a module is like a separate file with some python code so in python we have this math module which includes lots of mathematical functions for working with numbers but we need to import this module so we can use it on the top we type import math now math in this program is an object so we can use the dot notation to see all the functions or more accurately all the methods available in this object as an example we have math seal for getting the ceiling of a number so if we pass 22 here and run this program we get three now in this math module we have lots of functions let me show you how to find the complete list here on google search for python 3 make sure to add the version number math module on this page you can see all the functions in the math module so in this lecture we looked at math seal we also have math copy sign fabs and so on as an exercise i encourage you to play with a couple of functions in this module all right now lets take a look at another useful builtin function in python we use the input function to get input from the user as an argument we pass a string this will be a label that will be displayed in the terminal youll see that in a second so lets add x colon now this function returns a string so we can store it in this variable now lets imagine that y should be x 1 save the changes now dont run this program using the code runner extension because code runner by default runs your program in the output window which is read only so you wont be able to enter a value so open up the terminal using control and backspace once again if youre on windows type python if youre on mac or linux linux type python 3 and then apppy so heres our label lets enter a value like one we got an error type error what is going on here well when we receive input from the user this input always comes as a string so this expression at runtime will look like this string 1 1 note that the number one is different from string one because these are two different types now when python sees this expression it doesnt know what to do because two objects can be concatenated if they are of the same type so here we need to convert this string one to a number in python we have a few builtin functions for type conversion we have int for converting a number to an integer we have float we have bull and stir or string now in this case we dont need to convert x to a string because x is already a string if you dont believe me let me show you so im going to comment out these few lines now lets print type of x so type is another builtin function we pass an object as an argument and it returns its type also im going to comment out this line because thats the bad boy we dont want to execute this save the changes back in the terminal lets run this program one more time enter one look this is what the type function returns now dont worry about the class well talk about classes later in the course so the type of x is a stir or string so lets delete this line to fix this problem we need to convert x to an integer and then we can print both x and y using a format of string remember so we add an f quotes right here we add a label like x then well add a field so here we want to print the value of x variable after that we add some more text and finally we want to print the value of y lets run this program one more time so here in the terminal lets enter one and heres the result x is one and y is two beautiful now all these builtin functions are selfexplanatory the only tricky one is bull because in python we have this concept of truthy and falsey values these are values that are not exactly a boolean true or false but they can be interpreted as a boolean true or false so here are the falsy values in python m2 strings are considered falsy so theyre interpreted as a boolean false numbers z is also falsy we have an object called non which represents the absence of a value well look at this later in the course so whenever we use these values in a boan context we get false anything else will be true let me show you a few examples so in this interactive shell in python lets convert number zero to bull thats falsy so we get false what about bull of one we get true if we pass a negative number we also get true if we pass a number larger than one like five we still get true so we only get false when we try to convert zero to aoia now with strings i told you that an empty string is falsey so here well get false anything else is true so even if i have a string that is false well get true because the this is not an empty string its a string with a few characters thats why its evaluated as true all right once again its time for another quiz lets see if you have been really paying attention to this tutorial so heres the first question what are the builtin primitive types in python we have strings numbers and booleans numbers can can be integers floats or complex numbers heres the second question you have this variable fruit set to apple what do you think we will see on the terminal when we print fruit of one well using screw brackets we can access individual characters the index of the first character is zero so this expression returns the second character which is p what if we add a colon and negative one here well using the syntax we can slice a string our start index is one and our end index is negative 1 which refers to the first character from the end of the string now when slicing a string the character at the end index or1 is not included so with this expression well get all the characters starting from the second character which is p all the way until we get to e so the result of this expression is ppl l heres another question what is the result of this expression well this is what we call the modulus operator and it returns the remainder of a division which is in this case one and finally the last question what do you think we will see when we print bull of false well earlier i told you about falsy values in python so number zero an mty string and the nonob these are all falsy values anything that is not falsey is considered truthy here we have a string that has five characters it doesnt matter what those characters are this is not an empty string so its not falsey its truy so when we convert it using the bull function well get the boolean true and this brings us to the end of the section in the next section youre going to learn the fundamentals of computer programming i hope you have enjoyed this section and thank you for watching were going to start this section by exploring comparison operators we use comparison operators to compare values here are a few examples so 10 is greater than three we get true so what we have here is a boolean expression because when this expression is evaluated well get a boolean value that is true or false here is another example 10 is greater than or equal to three once again we get true we also have less than so 10 is less than 20 we have less than or equal to heres the equality operator so 10 is equal to 10 what about this expression what do you think were going to get we get false because this values have different types and theyre stored differently in the computers memory and finally we have the not equal operator so now with this expression we should get true beautiful we can also use these comparison operators with strings let me show you so we can check to see if bag is greater than and apple we get true because when we sort these two words bag comes after so its considered greater now what about this one bag equals capital bag we get false heres the reason every character you see here has a numeric representation in programming let me show you so we have this builtin function called or dont worry about memorizing this because youre probably never going to use this in the future but let me show you the numeric representation of the letter b so that is 98 in contrast capital b is represented as 66 that is the reason these two strings are not equal so these are the comparison operators in python next well look at conditional statements in almost every program there are times you need to make decisions and thats when you use use an if statement heres an example lets say we have a variable called temperature we set it to 35 now if temperature is greater than 30 perhaps we want to display a message to the user so we use an if statement if after if we add a condition which is basically a boolean expression an expression that produces a boolean value so if temperature is greater than 30 here we have a boolean expression if this expression evaluates to true the following statements will be executed let me show you now heres the important part that a lot of beginners miss when you use an if statement you should always terminate your statement with a colon now lets see what happens when i press enter our cursor is indented so here we have two white spaces this is very important because using these indentations python interpreter will know what statements should be executed if this condition is true here we want to print a message like its warm we can print another message as well drink water so we can have as many statements as we want here as long as they are indented they belong to this if block now when we finish here we should remove indentation to indicate the end of this if block so here we can add a print statement with a message like don this statement will always be executed whether this condition is true or not now note that when i save the changes this indentation you see here is going to be doubled up take a look save there you go so when we save the changes autop pep 8 reformats our code and uses four white spaces for indentation so one 2 3 4 it uses four white spaces because thats what pep 8 recommends all right now lets run this program so because temperature is greater than 30 we see the first two messages and we see the dawn message regardless so if i change the temperature to lets say 15 and run the program one more time look this dawn message is executed whether our condition is true or not so pay great attention to these indentations thats one of the issues i see in beginners code lets say they want both these print statements to be executed if the condition is true accidentally they remove the indentation on the fourth line and thats why their program doesnt work as they expect so be careful about this now what if you want to have multiple conditions we use an l if statement so l if that is short for ls if here we can add another condition another expression so temperature is greater than 20 one once again colon enter now by default here vs code is using two white spaces so dont worry about this as soon as you save the changes those two white spaces will be converted to four white spaces so lets print a different message its nice save the changes now look all these lines are indented consistently you can have as many l statements as you want and optionally you can also have an else statement so if none of the previous conditions are true then what you have in the else block will be executed once again we add the colon annotation print here we can add a message like its called save the changes in this case temperature is 15 so none of these two conditions will be true and we will see its called lets run the program there you go in this lecture im going to show you a technique for writing cleaner code so lets say were building an application for university and we want to check to see if the person whos applying for this university program is eligible or not so we start by defining a variable called age set it to 22 now if age is greater than or equal to 18 colon print eligible remove the initation else colon print not eligible lets run the program make sure it works beautiful now there is nothing wrong in this piece of code but i want to show you a cleaner way to achieve the same result instead of having a print statement here we can define a variable like message and set it to this string that is the first step so message equals this string and then we will print this message now when you have an if l statement with this structure where youre basically assigning a value to a variable you can rewrite this in a simpler way so this is how it works all we want to do over these vi lines is to assign a value to this message variable right so with start with message we set it to eligible if age is greater than or equal to 18 else we set it to not eligible this statement is almost like plain english so what we have on line seven is exactly equivalent to these four lines of code delete save the changes run the program you can see this person is eligible if i change the age to 12 12 and run the program we get not eligible so what we have here is called turner operator in python we have three logical operators and we use these operators to model more complex conditions so these operators are and or and not lets see a real word example of using these operators so imagine were building an application for processing loans so we need two variables high income we can set this to true and good underlined credit we set it to true now heres the condition we want to implement if the applicant has high income and good credit score then they are eligible for the loan so if high income and good credit we add the colon and print eligible now note that here i have not compared the value of this variable with true that is one of the issues i see in a lot of beginners code this is redundant and unprofessional because high income is a boolean so its either true or false we dont need to compare true with true so if this condition is true and this second condition is true then we will print eligible in the terminal so save the changes and run the program obviously this person is eligible however if one of these conditions is false we will not see eligible in the terminal so lets add an lse statement here and print not eligible run the program we see not eligible so this is how the and operator works with and operator if both conditions are true the result will be true in contrast with the or operator as long as at least one of the conditions is true the result will be true so if i replace and with or here we should see eligible in the terminal lets run it one more time there you go so these are the and and or operators now lets take a look at an example of the not operator so im going to define another variable student set it to true temporarily im going to remove this expression and simplify it well come back to this later so lets say if the person is eligible if they are not a student the not operator basically inverses the value of a boolean so in this case student is true when we apply the not operator the result will be false so in this case our condition will be false and thats why this print statement will not not be executed let me show you so save run the program theyre not eligible if student was false when we apply the not operator will get true so our condition will be true and well see eligible lets run it one more time there you go with these operators we can model even more complex conditions heres an example a person can be eligible if they have either high income or good cr credit and they should not be a student let me show you how to implement this condition so if high income or good credit we want at least one of these conditions to be true so we put these in parenthesis we want to separate these from the other condition which is not a student now the result of this should be true which means at least one of these conditions should be true after that will add and not student and finally call so with these operators you can model all kinds of real word scenarios so heres the example from the last lecture a person is eligible for a loan if they have high income and good credit and theyre not a student now one thing you need to know about this boolean operator is that they are short circuit what do i mean by that well when python interpreter wants to evaluate this expression it starts from the first argument if this is true it continues the evaluation to see if the second argument is also true so it continues the evaluation all the way to the end of this expression however as soon as one of these arguments is false the evaluation stops let me show you what i mean so if i change high income to false when python interpreter sees this expression it starts here it knows that high income is false so it doesnt matter what comes after the result of this entire expression will always be false because at least one of the arguments or one of the operant is false this is what we call short circuiting just like the short circuit concept we have in electronics so the evaluation stops as as soon as one of these arguments evaluates to false we have the same concept with the or operator so if i change these and operators to or lets see what happens with the or operator we know that at least one of the arguments should be true so the evaluation stops as soon as we find an argument that evaluates to true in this case when python interpreter evaluates this expression it sees that high income is false so so it continues the evaluation hoping that the next argument will be true here good credit is true so evaluation stops and the result of this entire expression will be true so in python logical operators are short circuit in this lecture im going to show you how to chain comparison operators this is a very powerful technique for writing clean code heres an example lets say we want to implement a rule that says age should be between 18 and 65 heres how we can implement it so we define a variable like ag set it to 22 now if age is greater than or equal to 18 and age is less than 65 then we print eligible now heres a question for you how do we write this rule in math we can write it like this well more accurately we should have an equal sign here so age should be between 18 and 65 this is how we write this rule in math now ive got some good news for you we can write the exact same expression in python so im going to move this up put an if statement here line four and line three are exactly equivalent but as you can see line four is cleaner and easier to read so lets get rid of line three this is what we call chaining comparison operators all right heres a little quiz for you i want you to pause the video and think about this quiz for 10 to 20 seconds what do you think well see on the terminal when we run this program so pause the video figure out the answer when youre ready come back continue watching all right lets see what happens when we run this program first we get this if statement in this case were comparing two different objects for equality and these objects have different types we have a number compared with a string so number 10 and string 10 are not equal that is why a will not be printed on the terminal so the control moves to the l if part here we have two boolean expressions heres the first one heres the second one and they are combined using the logical end so if both these expressions are evaluated to true then this entire expression will be true and we will see be on the terminal lets see if both these expressions are evaluated to true heres the first part bag is greater than apple that is true because when we sort these words bag comes after apple but look at the second part part this expression is evaluated to false because bag is not greater than cat so when we apply the logical end between true and false the result will be false that is why this statement will not be executed so to control moves to the lse part and when we run this program the letter c will be printed on the terminal there are times that we may want to repeat a task a number of times for example lets say we send a message to a user if that message cannot be delivered perhaps we want to retry three times now for simplicity lets imagine this print statement is equivalent to sending a message in a real world program to send a message to a user we have to write five to 10 lines of code now if you want to retry three times we dont want to repeat all that code that is ugly thats when we use a loop we use loops to create repetition so here is how it works we start with four number in we have a builtin function called range now how many times we want to repeat this task lets say three times so we call range and pass three as an argument now similar to our if statements we need to terminate this line with a colon enter we get indentation so in this block we can write all this statements that should be repeated three times lets do a print a message like attempt save the changes run the program so we have attempt printed three times beautiful now what is this number lets take a look its a variable of type integer so lets pass it as the second argument to the print function number run the program this is what we get 012 so here we have a for loop this for loop is executed three times in each iteration number will have a different value initially it will be zero in the second iteration it will be one and finally in the last iteration it will be two now here we can do something fun we can add one to this around the program and now the messages that we print are kind of more meaningful or more user friendly like attempting number one attempting number two and so on we can take this to the next level so we can pass another argument here im going to add an expression one more time number one so well get 1 2 3 now i want to put this expression in parenthesis so lets select this put it in parenthesis and then multiply it by a dot so here we have a string that is multiplied by a number the result will be that string repeated that number of times lets take a look so run the program see thats pretty cool isnt it now let me show you one more thing before we finish this lecture as you saw this range function generates numbers starting from zero all the way up to this number here but it doesnt include this number here we can pass another argument say start from one and finish before four with this change we dont need to add one to number every time because in the first ation this number variable will be set to one so we can simplify our code and make it cleaner lets run it one more time we get the exact same result we can also pass a third argument as a step so im going to change the second argument to 10 and pass two as a step look at the result these are the numbers we get 1 3 5 and so on so pretty useful youre going to use this function a lot in real world application continuing with the example from the last lecture lets imagine the scenario where after the first attempt we can successfully send the message in that case we want to jump out of this loop we dont want to repeat this task of sending a message three times let me show you how to implement this so in this demo im going to simulate the scenario where we can successfully send a message so we define a variable successful and set it to true now here after this print statement well have an if statement if successful colon then perhaps we can print successful now here we want to jump out of this loop for that we use the breck statement lets trun this program and see what happens so there you go after the first attempt youre successful and there are no more attempts so once again i want you to pay great attention to the indentation here because thats one of the common issues amongst beginners so heres our for loop these two lines are indented with four spaces and they belong to our for loop in every iteration these two lines will be executed now when we get to line four if this condition is true then these two lines will be executed because both these lines are indented below this if statement now lets take this program to the next level what if we attempt three times and we still cannot send an email perhaps we want to display a different message to the user we say hey we tred three times but it didnt work so im going to change successful to false now at the end here we can add an l statement this is what we call a for l statement what we put under this l statement will only be executed if this loop completes without an early termination so if we never break out of this loop then the l statement will be executed so here we can print a message like attempted three times and failed so run the program see what we get three attempts followed by this message attempted three times and failed in contrast if we change successful to true because we terminate this loop using this break statement what we have in the else block will not be executed take a look r the program we have one attempt successful done in programming we have this concept called nested loops so we can put one loop inside of another loop and with this we can get some interesting results let me show you so im going to start with this loop for x in range five colon now inside of this loop im going to add another loop so for y in range three colon and then in our second loop im going to add a print statement here we can use formatted strings to display coordinates remember formatted strings so we have f followed by quotes now here we add parentheses for our coordinates first we want to display x and then comma followed by y lets run this program and see what happens there you go pretty cool isnt it so we get zero and zero 0o and one zero and two then we get one and zero one and one one and two and so on now let me explain how exactly python interpreter executes this code so here we have two loops this is what we call the outer loop and this is the inner loop so the execution of our program starts here in the first iteration of this loop x is zero now we get to this statement which is a child of this four statement because its indented four times this statement itself is a loop so what we have inside of this loop will be executed three times in the first iteration x is zero because were still in the first iteration of the outer loop and y is also zero because we are in the first iteration of the inner loop that is why we get zero and zero now we go to the second iteration of this inner loop in this iteration y will be one whereas x is still zero that is why we get 0 and one and similarly in the third iteration of our inner loop well get zero and two in the terminal now were done with the execution of the inner loop so the control moves back to our outer loop here will be in the second iteration so x will be one and then we start here again so we have to execute this inner loop three times in the first iteration y will be zero and x is one so here we have one and zero then well get one and one and one and two you got the point so this is all about nested loops so you have learned how to use for loops to repeat one or more statements in your programs now lets dive deeper and see what this range function returns so earlier you learned about the builtin type function with this function we can get the type of an object so if i pass five here and run this program this is what we get so the type of this number or this object is int or integer now lets look at the type of the value that we get from the range function so as an argument we pass range of a number lets run this program so this range function returns an object of type range so in python we have primitive types like numbers strings and booleans but we also have complex types range is an example of one of those complex types throughout this course youre going to learn about a lot of other complex types now what is interesting about this range object is that its iterable which means we can iterate over it or use it in a for loop that is why we can write code like this so this range function returns a range object which is iterable which means we can iterate over it in each iteration x will have a different value now range objects are not the only iterable objects in python strings are also iterable so here we can add a string like python now in each iteration x will hold one character in this string let me show you so print x and im going to delete these two lines here lets run this program so in each iteration well get one character and print it we have another complex type called list which we use to store a list of objects so we add square brackets this indicates a list now we can add a list of numbers or a list of strings like a list of names you will learn about lists later in the course so lets run this one more time as you can see we can iterate over lists in in each iteration will get one object in this list now later in the course i will show you how to create your own custom objects that are iterable for example you will learn how to write code like this for item in shopping cart print item so shopping cart is going to be a custom object that you will create its not going to be an integer or string or boolean its a custom object it has a different structure and well make it iterable so we can use it in a for loop and in each iteration we can get one item in the shopping cart and printed on a terminal so you have learned that we use four loops to iterate over iterable objects in python we have another kind of loop that is a while loop and we use that to repeat something as long as a condition is true heres an example so lets define a variable number and set it to a 100 now we use while and here we add a condition as long as number is greater than zero we add a colon once again we have indentation so we can repeat one or more statements we can print this number and then we can divide it by half so number equals number use the integer division to divide it by two or we can use the augmented assignment operator to shorten this code like this now lets run this program so heres what we get initially our number is 100 we divide it by half we get 50 then 25 and so on so as you can see in this example we are not iterating over an itable like a range object or a string or a list we are evaluating a condition and repeating a task let me show you a real word example of a y loop in this interactive shell python is waiting for an input we can type something like 2 2 it will evaluate it and ask for the next input we can add another expression like 10 is greater than two so these steps will continue until we press contrl d so behind the scene we have a y loop that continues execution until we press contr d that is the condition that causes the y loop to terminate let me show you how to build something like this in python so lets define a variable command and set it to an empty string now here we need a y loop we want this y loop to execute as long as command does not equal to quit so command does not equal to quit colon in this loop we want to continue continuously get input from the user so we use the builtin input function we add a label like this get the result and store it in the command variable now at this point python interactive shell will evaluate this command were not going to do that in this lecture because thats way too complex for simplicity we can just echo back what the user entered so print echo and as the second argument we as this command so this is our y loop it will execute until we type quit now as i told you before dont run this program using the code runner extension because by default it will run your program in the output window which is read only so open up the terminal using control and back tick and run python or python 3 apppy so heres our command prompt lets type 2 two it echoes back lets type 3 2 there you go if we type quit our program terminates now lets try it one more time what if we type quit in uppercase the program doesnt terminate because as you learned before lowercase and uppercase characters have different numeric representations so quit in lowercase is different from quit in uppercase now to solve this problem an amateur programmer may do something like this and command does not equal to capital quit so while command does not equal quit in lowercase and quit in uppercase continue getting input from the user lets run this program in terminal and see what happens so one more time python apppy we type quit beautiful it works we type quit in uppercase that would work too but what if i type quit with an uppercase q and lowercase u our program doesnt terminate so this is a poor way of checking for the quit command what is a better way let me show you so we dont need this end operator here instead because command is a string we can call the lower method so whatever the user types in first willll convert it to lowercase and then compare it with quit in lowercase with this change it doesnt matter how the user types the word quit will always terminate the program now the last thing i want to discuss in this section is the concept of infinite loops an infinite loop is a loop that runs forever so if i change this condition to true because true is always true this y loop will will run forever so to jump out of this we need a break statement so after we get the input from the user we can get the command convert it to lowercase and see if it equals to quit if thats the case we want to break now with this change we no longer need to initialize command to an empty string previously we needed this because we had a while statement like this while command does not equal will quit so we had to define this command variable and thats why we have set it to an empty string without this line when python interpreter tries to execute this code it doesnt know what command is so now that we have an infinite loop we no longer need to define command and set it to an empty string so in terms of functionality this program is exactly the same as the program we wrote in the last lecture just be aware of these infinite loops because they run for ever you should always have a way to jump out of them otherwise your program will run forever and this can sometimes cause issues because if youre executing operations that consume memory at some point your program may run out of memory and crash all right time for an exercise i want you to write a program to display the even numbers between 1 to 10 so when you run this program you should see 2 4 6 and 8 and after these i want you to print this message we have four even numbers now heres a quick hint before you get started you should call the range function with one and 10 do not use the third argument which is called step so basically i want you to iterate over all the numbers between 1 to 10 check if each number is an even number and then print it on the terminal so pause the video spend 2 minutes on this exercise when youre done come back continue watching so we start with a for loop for number in range 1 to 10 colon we check to see if the remainder of division of this number by two equal z so if number modulus 2 equal z then reprint this number now lets run this program so we get 2 4 6 8 beautiful now to count the even numbers we need a separate variable so lets call that count initially we set it to zero now in this if block every time we find an even number we need to increment count so we said count plus equals 1 and finally after our for loop we can print a formatted string we have count count even numbers lets run the program and heres the result so that brings us to the end of this section in the next section youre going to learn how to create your own functions i hope you enjoyed the section and thank you for watching so far you have learned how to use some of the builtin functions in python such as print round and so on in this section youre going to learn how to write your own functions now you might ask but why do we even need to write our own functions well when you build a real program that program is going to consist hundreds or thousands of lines of code you shouldnt write all that code in one file like we have done so far you should break that code into a smaller more maintainable and potentially more reusable chunks you refer to these chunks as functions so let me show you how to create your own custom functions we start with the defa keyword which is short for define next we need to give our function a name so lets call this greet all the best practices you learn about naming your variables also apply to naming your functions so make sure your function names are meaningful descriptive use lowercase letters to name your functions and an underscore to separate multiple words now after the name we need to add parentheses you will see why shortly and then well add a column now what is going to happen you know it were going to get indentation which means the following statements will belong to this function so here im going to add two statements hi there and welcome aboard both these lines belong to this function because theyre indented now were done with this function we need to call it so we remove the indentation and we add two line breaks after this function this is what pep8 recommends to keep our code clean and maintainable now if you forget to add two line braks dont worry as soon as you save the changes autopep8 will automatically add these line braks for you let me show you so im going to remove these line braks and call this function great with parenthesis just like how we call the builtin functions now save the changes there you go so we get two line breaks after our function now lets run this program so we get these two messages on the terminal now heres a question for you what is the difference between the gre and print functions the difference is that this print function takes an input whereas our grd function doesnt take any inputs so let me show you how to pass inputs like first name and last name to this function when defining a function in between parentheses we list our parameters so here we add two parameters like first underline name and last underline name now when calling this function we need to supply two values for those parameters we refer to them as arguments so m hamedani these are the arguments to the greed function thats one of the terms that a lot of developers out there dont know they dont know the difference between parameters and arguments a parameter is the input that you define for your function whereas an argument is the actual value for a given parameter okay now lets change line two and instead of saying hi there we can greet a person by their full name so we can convert this to a formatted string and pass two fields here first name as well as last name save the changes run the program and this is what we get in terminal now this function is more useful we can reuse it and call it with different arguments so lets greet john smith as well run the program so we get hi msh hamadani and hi john smith now note that by default all the paramet that you define for a function are required so here our greed function takes two parameters if i exclude one of these arguments and save the changes you can see we have this red underline so pilent is complaining and saying there is no value for argument last name also if we run the program we get this type error greet missing one required positional argument so lets put this back now let ler i will show you how to define optional parameters so this is the simplified version of this great function we created earlier now in programming we have two types of functions functions that perform a task and functions that calculate and return a value here are some examples both the print and gd functions are example of type one theyre performing a task which is printing something on the terminal in contrast the round function is an example of a function that calculates and returns a value so the functions that you create fall into these two categories now let me show you how to rewrite this great function but in the second form so instead of printing this string on the terminal we simply return it let me show you so im im going to delete all this code define a new function but call it get underline greeting we add the name parameter and simply return this formatted string high name thats all we have to do so we use the return statement to return a value from this function now we can call this function get underlined greeting pass a name like msh because it returns a value we can store that value in a separate variable like message now you might be curious which form of these gting functions is better well with this first implementation we loged to printing something in the terminal in the future if we want to write that message in a file or send it in an email we have to create another function so we cannot reuse this great function in other scenarios in contrast this second form is not tied to printing something on the terminal it simply returns a value now we get this value and we can do whatever we want with it we can print it on the terminal or we can use the builtin open function to write this message to a file so we can create a file like content txt open it for writing this returns a file object and then we can call file write message now and dont worry about these two lines later in the course im going to talk about working with files but what i want you to take away here is that we have this message variable and we can do whatever we want with it we can print it on the terminal write it to a file send it in an email and so on and one more thing before we finish this lecture so heres our gd function and as you can see were simply printing a string now if we call gre give it a name run the program we get this message hi msh but what if we put this inside of a call to the print function lets see what we get we get high m followed by nonan what is this nonan is the return value of the great function so in python all functions by default return the non value non is an object that represents the absence of a value later in the course youre going to learn more about nonone what matters now is that all functions return non by default unless you specifically return a value so here if we return some string none will no longer be returned now i just want to clarify something earlier i told you that we have two types of functions in programming functions that carry out a task or functions that calculate and return a value so back to the code we previously had so even though this function returns nonone by default it is still classified as a function that carries out a task lets create another function we call it increment we want to use this function to increment a number by a given value so here we simply return number plus by now we can call this function like this and commment two and one this returns a value so we can store it in a variable like result and then print it on the terminal lets run the program we get three beautiful now we can simplify this code we have used this result variable only in a single place that is line six so we dont really need it so on line six we can replace result with a call to increment function like this so when python interpreter executes this code first it will call the increment function it will get the result and temporarily store it in a variable for us we dont see that variable and then it will pass that variable as an argument to the print function now if we run this program we get the exact same result beautiful now we can make this code more readable if someone else looks at line five they may not know exactly what these arguments are four we can use a keyword argument to make this code more readable so this one here is the value of this by parameter we can prefix it with the name of the parameter like this now we can read this code almost like plain english increment to by one so if youre calling a function with multiple arguments and its not quite clear what these arguments are for you can make your code more read by using keyword arguments so here y equals 1 is a keyword argument earlier i told you that all the parameters that you define for a function are required by default in this lecture im going to show you how to make the by parameter optional so lets say we dont want to explicitly pass by equals 1 every time we want to call this incr function we want to use this function to increment a value by one so we remove the second argument now we need to give this parameter a default value so we set it to one now if we call this function and dont supply the second argument this default value will be used otherwise the value that we specify here will be used let me show you so we run this program the result is three but if we pass the second ar argument here will increment two by five so we will get seven so you can see its pretty easy to make a parameter optional just be aware that all these optional parameters should come after the required parameters in other words i cannot add another required parameter here lets call that another i cannot add that here if i save the changes you can see we get a red underline here so all the optional parameters should come after the required parameters now obviously in this case we dont need the second parameter so lets delete it there are times that you may want to create a function that takes a variable number of arguments here is an example lets define this function multiply that takes two parameters x and y and simply returns x y now we can call this function like this so far so good but what if you want to pass one or two more arguments here that doesnt work because our multiply function takes only two parameters to solve this problem we need to replace these two parameters with a single parameter we use a plural name here to indicate that this is a collection of arguments and then we prefix it with an asterisk this is the magical part let me show you what happens when you use an asterisk here so temporarily lets delete this line and simply print numbers lets see what we get here so run the program you can see all our arguments and theyre packed in parenthesis what is this well earlier you learned about lists i briefly mentioned that you can use square bracket to create a list of objects like 2 3 4 5 now later in the course we have a comprehensive section about lists so dont worry about the details of lists and how they work but what i want you to note here is that the only difference between this list and what we have here is in the notation so we use square brackets to create lists and parentheses to create toles some people call it tles or tuples so a topple is similar to a list and that its a collection of objects the difference is that we cannot modify this collection we cannot add a new object to this toppo once again later in the course were going to have a comprehensive section about lists top holes and other data structures what matters now is that these topples just like lists are iterable so we can iterate over them which means we can use them in loops let me show you so lets write for number in numbers colon lets just print one number at a time actually we dont need this line so delete and run the program so we iterate over this top hole and in each iteration we get one number and printed on the terminal so now with a simple change we can calculate the product of all these numbers all we have to do is to define a variable like total initially we set it to one and then in each each iteration we get total and multiply it by the current number or we can rewrite this statement using an augmented assignment operator so total times equal number line five and four are exactly identical so im going to use line five because its shorter and cleaner delete and finally well return the total now one of the issues i see often in beginnner code is that they dont use this indentation properly so they put the return statement here and then they wonder why their function doesnt work properly if you put the return statement here it will be part of the for loop so it will be executed in each iteration in this case after the first iteration because of this return statement will return from this multiply function so the total will not be calculated properly we need to put this at the same level of indentation as other statements in this function so here we have our four statement we loop over all the numbers we calculate the total and then finally return it so with this implementation we can get the result and printed on the terminal lets run the program and you can see the product of these numbers is 120 hey guys i just wanted to let you know that this tutorial is actually the first two hours of my complete python mastery course if youre finding this helpful and want to dive even deeper the full course covers everything from beginner basics to advanced concepts like machine learning web development and automation youll also get handson projects to build your skills step by step i put the link in the description box if youre ready to take your python knowledge to the next level,7341

first cyber security job well look at the main areas you should study which certificates can help and how long each step might take if you can put in 3 to 5 hours of study or practice each day you can be ready for an entry level role in about 7 to 10 months lets jump right in first i want to give a quick shout out to our newest members edgars christian loveg shales joe thank you so much for joining this channel and supporting me youre awesome by the way if youre new here welcome this channel is all about helping you build a strong foundation in coding and land your dream tech job i create practical no fluff tutorials road maps and career advice to help you succeed if that sounds good hit subscribe and check out the other videos on this channel the first step is building a strong foundation in it this is a step that unfortunately a lot of people skip but its absolutely important especially if youre new to tech or transitioning from another job if someone asks you to fix their computer computer or troubleshoot their wifi and you have no clue this is your starting point otherwise you can skip to the next step now a great place to start is comptia a its a wellknown certification that covers foundational it knowledge like installing operating systems handling common pc issues managing essential software and so on ill put the link down below if youre interested if you spend 3 to 5 hours of studying every day this step should take you about a month or two by the way im not affiliated with comptia or any other companies im going to mention in this video im recommending them simply because theyre wellknown and give you a solid foundation in cyber security now assuming that you have a solid foundation in it the next step is computer networking if you really want to protect or attack systems you have to understand how data moves around so spent about a month or two learning osi and tcpip models common protocols like http https tcp and so on ip addressing and subnetting as well as basics of routers switches and firewalls if you want a structure way to learn and proove your networking skills comptia network plus is a great entry level certification it covers general networking principles without focusing on one brand of devices another option is ccna which goes deeper into ciscos own network and equipment its the gold standard for networking having it on your resume definitely helps you stand out but its more difficult than network plus by the way remember that certificates are only part of the story employers want to see real handson skills not just a piece of paper so dont assume that simply getting all these certificates is going to guarantee a job immediately make sure to build those essential skills and you certificates to give your resume an extra boost now lets talk about operating systems particularly windows and linux if youre just starting out pick one to focus on lets say windows if thats what you already use daily and get comfortable with file permissions logs and basic user management but in the long term you really should learn both because linux is extremely common in servers cloud environments and security tooling spend one to two months here now if you want a formal path for linux you can go for compt linux plus but honestly you can skip getting this certification because its not going to help you as much as other certifications like network plus or ccna if you want to get it do it for the knowledge next up is coding now you dont need to be an expert but having some knowledge of coding is going to help you a lot throughout your entire it journey the best language for you to learn is python because its very beginner friendly and its super common in cyber security i have a couple of pon tutorials on this channel one is only 1 hour long the other is more comprehensive theyre super easy to follow and millions of people have already watched them to learn python again links are down below i would also recommend to learn bash for linux or powershell for windows because these languages are also super common for automating tasks like file management user creation or system checks theyre very simple and once you learn a programming language like python learning a second language will be far easier now youre ready to learn cyber security fundamentals you have a a couple of certificate options here compa security plus is very popular and is often a requir checkbox for many roles especially government jobs another option is google cyber security professional certificate its newer so some hiring managers may be less familiar with it but its a solid path if you prefer a guided online approach now with all the foundations you have built so far next you can learn defensive security which is about defending against attacks in cyber security its often called blue teaming you should learn how to detect threat analyze logs and keep network secure you have a few certificate options here the first one is cisco cyber ops associate its a wellrespected certificate the other option is psaa by tcm security its a smaller brand than cisco but its very handson the other option is ptl1 by security team blue its laser focused on real world defensive tasks the next step is offensive security which is about testing systems or weaknesses in cyber security its often called red teaming spend about a month or two practice scanning networks exploit vulnerabilities and simulate real world hacks you can practice with platforms like try hack me or hack the box they provide safe labs for you to build real world hacking skills now for certifications you have a few options we have ejpt its a handson entrylevel red team certification the other option is pjp from ttm security its another beginner level penetration testing certificate another popular option is comptia pentest plus so thats pretty much it if you follow follow this road map and putting 3 to 5 hours every day you can be ready for an entrylevel security job in about 7 to 10 months of course everyone learns at their own pace so dont stress if you need a bit more time now if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below and i will do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and subscribe for more

right place today im sharing a complete blockchain road map ill walk you through the essential skills you need the tools i personally recommend and how much time you should spend on each assuming you dedicate 3 to 5 hours of studying every day this road map should take you about 8 to 10 months to complete lets jump right in first i want to give a quick shout out to our newest members edgars christian bluff gien shales joe thank you so much for joining this channel and supporting me youre awesome by the way if youre new here welcome this channel is all about helping you build a strong foundation in coding and land your dream tech job i create practical no fluff tutorials road maps and career advice to help you succeed if that sounds good hit subscribe and check out the other videos on this channel the first step to learning blockchain development is to pick up a programming language the two most popular languages for blockchain development are python and javascript python is the easiest to learn and is widely used in blockchain scripting javascript is common for frontend development and web 3 frameworks which well talk about later in this video if youre starting out stick to one language preferably python so you dont get confused after learning python picking up javascript will be much faster if you study and code 3 to 5 hours a day you can learn the basics of either language in about 2 months now to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box by the way i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a version control system like git git is not a programming language its a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and github which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer git has a ton of features but you dont need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gits features 1 to 2 weeks of practice is enough to get up and running again i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if you prefer structured learning the next step is studying data structures and algorithms this is one of the topics taught to computer science students that a lot of selftaught developers skip and is often asked in job interviews its particularly important for blockchain development because in blockchain development every operation can have a cost so you have to learn how to process and store data efficiently and this is where data structures come into the play you have to use the right data structure for the right problem so make sure to study the classic data structures like arrays link lists stacks cues and so on spend about a month or two on this and youll be in great shape once you have a good grasp of blockchain fundamentals youre ready to learn about smart contracts these are programs that run on a blockchain like little robots that follow specific rules and cant be changed once their life now solidity is the most popular language for writing smart contracts on ethereum dont let the name scare you its similar to other coding languages once you get the hang of it you can practice using remix ide which is a webbased development environment for ethereum smart contracts its great for beginners because you can start coding and testing your smart contracts immediately without extensive local setup once you get comfortable writing simple contracts with remix ide then i would recommend learning hard hat for more professional and enterprise level workflows its a popular local development environment for ethereum smart contracts it gives you a framework and a set of tools to build test deploy and debug smart contracts more effectively spend about a month or two building small projects like a basic token or nft now once you build and deploy a smart contract to a blockchain network then you need to allow users to interact with it and this is where dap or decentralized application development comes into play a dap is basically an application that looks and feels like a regular web or mobile app but instead of having a single company server at the back end it uses a blockchain network for its core operations now to build a dab you have to learn a front and framework for building user interfaces we have a few tools here like react angular and view but react is the most popular tool for building user interfaces now to learn react you need to learn javascript and ideally typescript which is a super cell of javascript that is widely used in react projects these days you can learn the essence of javascript and typescript in about 2 months and then you need another month or two to learn react also you should get familiar with web3 libraries like web3js or ethers js for connecting your frontend application to the blockchain so if you dedicate a few hours every day and follow this road map youll have the necessary knowledge to apply for an entrylevel blockchain developer job in about 8 to 10 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments and ill do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos if you enjoy this video please give it a like and

in 2025 stick around ive been in the industry for over 20 years and ive seen the trends come and go this video is based on what ive learned firsthand and whats happening in the real world right now according to the us bureau of labor statistics or bls employment in computer and information technology occupations is projected to grow much faster than the average for all occupations from 2023 to 2033 about 356000 openings are projected each year in these occupations due to the employment growth and the need to replace workers who leave the occupations permanently by the way if youre new here welcome this channel is all about helping you build a strong foundation in coding and land your dream tech job i create practical no fluff tutorials road maps and career advice to help you succeed if that sounds good hit subscribe and check out the other videos on this channel now before we dive in let me give you one key piece of advice dont try to learn everything you cant be a data scientist a mobile developer and a devops engineer all at the same time it just doesnt work pick one path focus and learn the skills that career demands ive created detailed road maps for many of the careers were about to discuss youll find the links in the description below lets kick things off with ai and machine learning these are the rock stars of tech right now transforming industries like healthcare finance and transportation take selfdriving cars for example ai engineers are the ones building the models that make these cars smarter every day the salary for a machine learning engineer is about 120000 to 180000 a year depending on your skills and location oh and if youre serious about this p ive got a detailed road map for ai and machine learning engineers check it out below the next career on our list is data scientists data scientists are the detectives of the tech world they take raw data and turn it into actionable insights think about netflix recommending your next favorite show or spotify curating playlist just for you thats data science in action its not just about crunching numbers its about understanding the story the data is telling the salary for a data scientist is around 1000 to 150000 and of course that depends on your scale and location and yes ive got a road map for data scientists as well link is in the description the next career on our list is cyber security specialist cyber security is like being a digital bodyguard with cyber attacks increasing every year this role is absolutely critical a friend of mine works in cyber security for a bank and he once told me they get hit by thousands of attack attempts every single day companies cant afford to take risks so theyre paying top dollar for experts in this field the salary for a cyber security specialist is around 990000 to 150000 and even higher if you specialize in areas like ethical hacking the next career on our list is cloud engineer cloud engineers are the backbone of modern technology theyre the ones making sure your favorite apps dont crash when millions of people use them at the same time for example did you know that netflix relies on amazon web services or aws to stream all his content without cloud engineers optimizing and maintaining that infrastructure your it chose wouldnt load as smoothly the salary for cloud engineering is around 110000 to 160000 the next career on our list is devops engineer devops is all about building and maintaining the pipelines that get your code from development to production its one of the most in demand skills today heres a real example every time amazon updates its website devops engineers make sure the changes are rolled out smoothly without breaking the side or slowing it down the salary for a devops engineer is around1 000 to 140000 and yes there is a road map for this one too check the description the next career on our list is full stack developer fullstack developers build both the front end and back end of applications making them super versatile and valuable i think going forward in 2025 companies value fullsack developers more than people who can only build the front end or back end the salary for a fullsack developer ranges from 880000 to 130000 and by the way ive got a road map for fullsack developers as well links below the next career on our list is blockchain developer now blockchain isnt just about cryptocurrency anymore companies like walmart are using blockchain to track their supply chains and its being used in industries like healthcare and real estate too if you can build smart contracts or understand decentralized systems youll be in high demand the salary for a blockchain developer is around 120000 to 180000 and even higher for specialists so these are the careers that i believe are going to be in high demand in 2025 if youre serious about starting check out the detailed road maps ive created for you they will show you exactly what you need to learn links are in the

about ai jensen hang the ceo of nvidia actually said that kids wouldnt even need to learn to code anymore because according to him everyone in the world is now a programmer it is our job to create computing technology such that nobody has to program everybody in the world is now a programmer this is the miracle this is the miracle of artificial intelligence yeah he said everyone in the world is now a program and then there is emad mushak ceo of stability ai who said that in just 5 years there wouldnt be any human programmers left sounds wild right but heres the reality ai isnt exactly living up to that hype instead of taking over programming its causing a whole new set of issues studies are showing that ai generated code is often buggy insecure and honestly not very reliable in this video were going to dive into to why this ai hype bubble might be popping well check out some numbers talk about why certain ai companies might be overvalued and see why some investors are starting to lose that initial excitement if you actually had to talk about the thing he selling today you go well its a calculator of sorts well it doesnt always work but when it does its sort of good so what happened how did we go from ai is going to replace programmers to ai is making things more complicated lets look at the research lets start with a recent study by up level that looks at the reality of ai in coding they studied over 800 developers using ai coding tools like github copilot and the results not exactly what you would expect first they found that developers using ai saw a 41 increase in bugs yeah while ai might help you write code faster its also adding a lot more errors meaning more time spent fixing those errors so in instead of spitting things up ai can actually slow you down in the end and even though you would think that ai tools would help developers complete tasks faster the study didnt show any real improvements in task completion or issue resolution basically ais promises of efficiency dont quite hold up also developers using these tools didnt feel any less stressed or burned out their workload and stress levels stayed pretty much the same even though ai was supposed to take over some of those rep competitive tasks so yeah it sounds great in theory but in practice not so much next up lets talk about a study from get clear they analyzed millions of lines of code to see how ai tools actually affect developer productivity if you thought ai was making things more efficient think again one big takeaway was that ai generated code has a 39 higher churn rate meaning a lot of it gets rewritten or removed shortly after its created so nearly 40 of that ai generated code ends up being redone which is basically waste of time and thats not all this study found about 11 more duplicated code when developers used ai tools instead of generating efficient reusable code ai tends to spit out new code unnecessarily which just clutters your code base now duplicated code isnt just ugly it can also introduce bugs in multiple places and make your software harder to debug and scale so yeah ai might help you pump out code faster but it also creates a ton of instability more churn more duplicated code it all adds up to less reliable software and more effort spent maintaining a clean code base in the end its more work not less not exactly the game changer we were promised right oh it it thinks that bofa is a real protocol and its like i dont know how to do that hey i wanted to tell you about something thats been improving my youtube experience a ton and thats youtube premium have you ever been watching a video and at the best part and ad pops up well youtube premium gets rid of that you can watch all your favorite content without a single ad ive been using youtube premium for the past few years and its the best experience especially when im in bed i love listening to podcasts and i hate those annoying ads popping up but thanks to youtube premium i never get them but theres more with youtube premium you can also download your favorite videos this is great if youre traveling or dont have access to highspeed internet you can download videos ahead of time and watch them offline another great benefit is that you can keep your videos playing in the background when you switch to other apps ever been watching a video and then you get a text from a friend when you switch to the other app the video usually stops right with youtube premium your videos keep playing in the background while you switch to other apps so how do you get all these perks youtube premium is a paid monthly subscription service you can pay a very low monthly fee and get all these benefits no commitments you can cancel anytime but heres the best part if you subscribe through the link in the description or the banner in this video you will get two months free and i may earn a commission you will not only get an amazing atree experience but you will also support my channel so if you want 2 months of youtube premium for free subscribe using the link in the description now lets talk about security because when youre writing code its not just about getting it done its about getting it right and this is where ai coding assistants start to fall short a study from stanford found that the developers using an ai assistant wrote significantly less secure code than those working without one whats worse is that developers who had access to an ai assistant were actually more likely to believe their code was secure even when it wasnt this suggests that ai tools might be giving developers a false sense of confidence ai generated code often looks right which makes developers trust it too easily and this false sense of security is a big deal in fields like healthcare finance or infrastructure places where security really cant be compromised now dont get me wrong im not saying ai is useless or we should stop using it as a developer i can tell you that ai has definitely boosted my productivity i use it all the time for repetitive tasks its great for generating boilerplate code like the stuff that nobody wants to write from scratch its great for translating code from one language to another or quickly throwing together a prototype so yes ai is a powerful tool but its just that a to the future of coding is an ai replacing developers its developers working with ai anyone telling you otherwise probably has never built real enterprise software in their life or theyre trying to sell you something look coding isnt even the hardest part of being a software engineer we spend a ton of time in meetings gathering requirements setting up environments and digging through old code bases to understand whats really going on coding is only one piece of the puzzle so think of ai like spell checker for writers it makes us more productive but its not replacing us anytime soon if ever and this brings us to a big takeaway education ai might help with some coding but you still need to understand whats going on behind the scenes you can just trust it blindly companies have learned this the hard way ai can give you code that looks great at first but if you dont fully understand it youre opening the door to bugs instability and security risks on top of that just copy pasting ai generated code can lead to technical death code thats so messy and complex that no one can work with without breaking something thats why in my courses i focus on teaching you to write clean maintainable code that solves real problems i dont just show you what to write i explain why we are doing it this way knowing the reasoning behind your code is key to becoming a great developer someone who can create software that is functional scalable and sustainable in the long run so ai is awesome and it can definitely spit things up but dont use it blindly dont skip learning the fundamentals best practices or the reasoning behind your code just because ai can generate it for you because heres the truth if you dont understand what your code is doing youre not making yourself more valuable youre actually putting yourself at risk of being left behind you wont lose your job to ai you will lose it to the developer who has solid programming skills and knows how to use ai to be even better ai is here to help not to replace us so invest in yourself learn the fundamentals understand the details and then use ai to level up if you found this video helpful please like and subscribe for more coding advice,520

beginners in this course were not just going to build some cool python projects were going to dive deep into the process of thinking like a programmer coding isnt just about getting things to work its about understanding the problem breaking it down and building solutions that are clean maintainable and actually make sense most courses will show you how to write code but they dont teach you why youre writing it that way here i will walk you through my entire problem solving process from the initial idea to the final polished solution by the end of this course you wont have just cool projects under your belt youll have the skills to tackle coding challenges with confidence and write code that you can be proud of so if youre ready to go beyond just coding and start thinking like a problem solver lets dive into python projects for beginners now before we jump into projects i want to quickly talk about what youll need to know to get the most out of this course you dont need to be a python expert to follow along just a basic familiarity with python is all thats required if you know how to work with variables loops functions and maybe a little bit of file handling youre all set as we go through the projects ill be using some more advanced python features here and there but dont worry ill explain those concepts thoroughly as we encounter them if you feel like you need a little refresher or you want to di deeper into python ive got you covered you can check out my python tutorial on youtube where ill walk you through the basics in a clear and easier to understand way and if youre looking to really master python ive got a full course on my website that takes you from the basics to advanced concepts the links are below this video now i want to quickly go over some of the materials that come with this course first we have the project handbook this is a pdf that outlines all the projects were going to work on together for each project ive included additional challenges for those of you who want to push yourselves further next all the code we write in this course is available on github this is where you can find the complete source code for each project whether you want to compare your solution with mine or just grab the code to experiment with its all there for you youll find the links to both the project handbook and the github repository right below this video all right with that out of the way lets move on to the next music lesson before we dive into the projects i want to take a moment to talk about how ive structured this course and how you can get the most out of it ive designed this course to be handson and practical for each project ill start by showing you the project and its requirements at this point i encourage you to pause and try to work on this solution on your own this is where the real learning happens by thinking through the problem and applying what you have learned so far once you have given it a shot come back and watch how i break down the problem into manageable steps and start coding the solution your code may be different and thats totally fine i dont expect your solution to be exactly like mine we all think differently use my solution and code as inspiration to see if there are better ways to write code for the first few projects if you feel like youre not quite ready to start and finish a project on your own just watch my solution and c along with me then once you have a bit more confidence tackle the other projects on your own and then come back to see my solution for ideas to improve your code look ive been coding for over 25 years and i still encounter challenges depending on the projects im working on so if you find some of these projects difficult dont be discouraged thats part of your learning journey the things that feel complex today will eventually become simple and youll be ready to take on new challenges remember this course isnt about quick wins its about building a strong foundation in problem solving that will serve you throughout your career by the end of each project you will not only have a working solution but also a deep understanding of the logic and thought process behind it now lets get music started all right for our first project were going to build a dice rolling game so let me show you what happens when we execute this program first we get this question roll the dice here we have only two options yes or no if we type anything else we get an error message saying invalid choice now we can type of y either lowercase or uppercase it doesnt matter and every time we get two new random numbers just like how we roll a dice now if you type n our program terminates and displays a message saying thanks for playing now i want you to spend 10 to 20 minutes on this project and then come back and see my solution music all right before we jump into coding i always take a moment to map out what i want to do kind of like checking a map before we start a road trip it helps me see the big picture and avoid getting lost along the way so lets quickly plan our approach before we start writing any code trust me it makes things much smoother so in this python file im going to use comments to map out how this program should behave so first we should ask the user a question like roll the dice then we should check the user input so if user enters y then we should generate two random numbers and print them otherwise if the user enters no then we should print a thank you message and terminate the program otherwise if the user types anything else we want to print an error message like invalid choice now we want to make sure that the user can keep playing until they decide to terminate the game so we should put these instructions inside a loop for repetition so everything here should go inside a loop an infinite loop okay now lets start converting these comments into actual code so first were going to ask the user to roll the dice and to do that we use the input function now here we should type a prompt we can use double quotes or sing quotes different people have different preferences whatever you like just make sure to stick to that so here im going to ask roll the dice and give the options yes or no we add a colon followed by a whit space so whatever the user types will be separated from our prompt okay now we store the result in a variable we can call it choice next we should check if choice equals y so if choice equals a lowercase y or choice equals an uppercase y thats one way to do this but there is a smarter way we can treat whatever the user types as lowercase so look if you hover our mouse over this choice variable look at the type the type is a string so the input function returns a string and you know that in python string objects have a bunch of methods so here we can use the lower method to convert whatever the user types into lowercase with that we can get rid of the second condition okay now we should generate two random numbers and to do that first we have to import the random module now in this module we have a method we can call random rand int to generate a random integer or a random number between these two numbers a and b in this case one and six now this returns a random number so we store it in a variable like die one now we have to repeat this to generate the second random number next we should print these numbers so here we call print now for simplicity we can use a formatted or an f string so we type an f before our quotes and here we add parenthesis inside the parenthesis we want to print our random numbers like one and two but instead of hardcoding these numbers we want to print the actual random numbers that are generated here so we replace one with curly braces to add a placeholder or a hole in our string and inside this hole we add d one and similarly replace two with curly braces and add die two so we print these numbers next we should check if the user types an n so l if choice equals n then we want to print a thank you message so thanks for playing now to terminate the program we want to break out of our loop now we havent added the loop here so on the top now there are two ways to do this some people like to declare a variable like running or playing and initialize it to true then they add it as the loop condition so while playing is true then were going to repeat these instructions and and when the user types an n we can use the break statement to jump out of this loop thats one way but there is a better way this variable here is really unnecessary so we can use true as the condition for this loop and get rid of one extra line of code also note that its a good practice to add a line bre between our import statements and the rest of the code it makes our code cleaner and easier to the eyes so were almost there now finally if the user types anything else we want to print an error message so print invalid choice as simple as that that was our first project depending on your programming skills this might be too easy for you but dont worry as we go through this course our projects will gradually get more complex now if you want to challenge yourself look at the workbook that i give you at the beginning of the course after each project there are ideas for enhancing the program and challenging yourself all right for our next project were going to build a number guessing game so here is how its going to work when we run our program it generates a random number between 1 and 100 that we have to guess now if we type an invalid number like a we get an error message so lets type a valid number like 50 now the program is giving us feedback it says this is too high so lets try 25 its still too high what if we try 10 still too high how about five now its too low so the number that the computer has generated is between 5 and 10 lets try seven its too low lets try eight there you go we guessed the number so spend 15 to 20 minutes on this project and then come back and see my solution all right once again before we write any code lets map out what exactly were going to do so first we should have our program generate a random number then we should ask the user to make a guess now we want to make sure that the user enters a valid number so if the user enters an invalid number so if not a valid number then we want to print an aror otherwise we should give the user some feedback so we can say if this number that the user entered is less than the number to guess we can say this is too low otherwise if this number that the user entered is higher than the number to guess we can say this is too high otherwise that means number equals guess right so in this situation we should say hey well done you made a guess now we want to make sure that the user can make multiple guesses so except the first line we should put the rest of our code inside a y loop for repetition so heres the structure of our program we dont want to add the first line inside the loop because we want to generate a random number only once okay now lets convert these commments into actual code to generate a random number first we import the random module then we add a line bre to separate our import statement from the rest of our program next we call random randint to generate a number between 1 and 100 lets store this in a variable called number to guess always use descriptive names for your variables so dont use variable names like n or x or a because someone else reading your code they have no clue what these variables represent okay so number two guess next we should ask the user to make a guess so i dont want to add the loop yet lets just convert this comment into code so here we call the input function and tell the user to guess the number between one and 100 now you know that the input function returns a string so we can store it in a variable like user input now we should convert this to a number and to do that we use the int function we pass user input and store the result in a variable called yes now look user input is only used in a single place there is no need for this variable anywhere else in this program because for the rest of our program were going to work with this integer so we can simplify our code and make it more concise by removing this variable its unnecessary so we can get the string that is returned from the input function and pass it directly to the int function with this we can remove this unnecessary variable so when this program is executing first the input function is called then the return value which is a string is passed to the int function okay now how can we validate that this is a valid number well before we do that lets just print yes on the terminal to see if our program works up to this point so this is a good technique for building larger programs always do it in baby steps so instead of implementing the entire program do it in baby steps make sure it works and then move on so so here in the terminal lets run our program and enter an invalid number like a all right look our program crashed because an exception is thrown on this line and heres the type of the exception value error so to handle this situation and prevent our program from crashing we have to add this line inside a tri block so we type try then add indentation now right after try we should type accept followed by the type of error we want to handle in this case value error okay now if we end up here we want to print an error message and say please enter a valid number okay lets run our program one more time so i type a okay this time our program didnt crash instead we got a friendly error message beautiful so were done with this step now we should give the user some feedback so after the accept block i want to add a line bre to separate this bit of logic from the rest of the logic which is about giving the user some feedback so using these line breaks is like how we break up a story into multiple paragraphs imagine if you read a book and there are no paragraphs obviously reading that book is very difficult so here we can check if gu is less than number to yes reprint a message and say too low now here we have an error message on the guest variable saying guess is possibly unbound i know this is a weird error message but basically this is happening because we have declared this variable inside the tri block so its only meaningful inside the tri block this is called the scope of this variable so to fix this error we have to move these two lines inside our tri block and add anotation so we read a number then we check if its less than the number to guess otherwise l if guess is greater than number to guess we print to high otherwise that means the user guessed it correctly so here we can say congratulations you guessed the number now lets get rid of these comments we dont need them anymore now we want to put all these instructions inside an infinite loop so here we type while true and move all these lines inside our loop now after congratulating the user we should use a break statement to break out of this loop okay now lets run our program and see what happens so first we enter an invalid number okay we got an error message so we can try again lets type b this time beautiful now lets type a number like 50 its too high lets try 25 its too low so lets try 40 too low what about 45 too high so its between 40 and 45 lets try 43 its too low it has to be 44 okay our program music terminated all right our next project is a fun game that we have all played in our childhood rock paper scissors game now this project is a little bit more challenging than the previous projects so let me run the program and show you how it works first we get a question rock paper or scissors here we only have three choices r p or s if we type anything else we get an error message saying invalid choice now let me go with r that is short for rock so i chose rock computer chose paper and i lost now right after we get asked if you want to continue lets try again this time im going to go with scissors so i chose scissors computer chose paper i want now i dont want to continue so lets type in the game ends again this project is a bit more challenging than the previous ones so spend about 20 to 30 minutes on this and then come back and see my music solution all right once again before we write any code lets map out what were going to do so first were going to ask the user to make a choice now if the choice is not valid were going to print an error otherwise we should let the computer to make a choice as well next we should print the choices using emojis and this is the font part next we should determine the winner and finally we ask the user if they want to continue if not were going to terminate the game so this is the structure of our program now lets start coding so first we should ask the user to make a choice to do that we use the input function here we type rock paper or scissors and in parenthesis we can type the valid options so r p and s now we get the result and store it in a variable called user choice next we should validate the choice so just like before here were going to call the lower method so we can treat the users input as lowercase text we talked about this technique in one of our earlier projects now to validate the users choice here we can use a bunch of if statements so we can say if user choice does not equal r and user choice does not equal p and user choice does not equal s then we can print an error message and say invalid choice thats thats one way but this is not a very clever or very professional way to implement this there is a better way we can store the list of valid choices in a list and then check to see if the users choice is in that list or not so in the first line we can declare a variable called choices and initialize it to a list of valid choices so r p and s now we can simplify this if statement and say if user choice not in choices then print an error message this implementation is more concise and more elegant now we can further improve this and convert this list to a topple why because lists can be modified in our program so somewhere you might accidentally modify the list and use the append method to add a new item to the list or remove method to remove one of the existing items this could be an accidental mistake but if you convert this to a top hole it becomes read only so top holes look they dont have the remove or append methods so a topple is just like a readon list okay so we have our valid choices and we are done with this step now before going further lets test our program so im going to remove these two lines now back to the terminal lets run our program so if you type a we get an error message beautiful but if ify type r we dont get an error great next we should let the computer to make a choice and to do that first we have to import the random module now earlier we used the rand in method to generate a random number between two numbers but here we want to use a different method and that is choice with this we can pass a list or a top hole like choices and let the computer choose one of these valid choices so so lets store the result in a separate variable like computer choice so were done with this step now lets print the choices so first i want to print the choices without emojis just to make sure that our program is working up to this point so here we can type you chose and then use concatenation to append users choice here thats one way but a better and more elegant way is to use a formatted string so we prefix the string with an f which is short for formatted and here we add curly braces to insert a value dynamically in this case user choice with this we dont have to use concatenation okay similarly we can duplicate this line and say computer chose and here we add computer choice okay lets run our program so i type r okay we both chose rock lets try again thats weird its happening twice lets run it one more time im going to select s okay so i selected scissors computer selected rock beautiful now we should print emojis how can we do that well there are two ways one way is to use an if statement and say if user choice equals r then we can print an emoji on mac you can bring up the emoji keyboard by pressing control command land and space on windows im not entirely sure so here we can type rock and select this rock okay now similarly we can add a second condition and say if user choice equals s then were going to print scissors but again this approach is not the best way because we need three statements to map these letters to emojis let me show you a better way first let me remove these few lines okay now in python we have a data structure called a dictionary a dictionary is used to map a key to a value so we can map the character r to the emoji of a rock similarly we can map the letter s to scissors okay now how can we declare a dictionary well here we can declare a variable called emojis and set it to curly braces inside the braces we type key value pairs so our key is going to be r then we type a colon and map it to the emoji of a rock note that in this case both our key and value are strings but this is not a requirement so we can map a string to a number or an object whatever we want to do now similarly lets map s to scissors and also p2 paper okay now lets remove these comments back to the part about printing the users choice instead of printing the users choice which is a letter like r p or s we are going to go to this dictionary and look up the value associated with a given key so here we type emojis then using square brackets we can look up the value associated with one of these keys now here in the aut completion box we can see the valid keys which are p r or s but were going to replace this with user choice now similarly here we type emojis and pass computer choice lets run the program one more time if i type r i get rock and computer chose caesar beautiful all right were done with this step the next step is deter determining the winner now before moving forward i want to add some line brecks to divide our code into different segments just like the paragraphs of an article so on the top we are declaring our emojis and valid choices these two lines are highly related so i want to keep them together but look at the next line the next line is about getting the user input this line has nothing to do with the previous lines so its like a different paragraph in a story so here we add a line break now again these three lines are highly related because they are part of getting the users input so we want to keep them together but separate them from getting the computers choice now once again we add the line break here because this segment is all about printing the users and computers choice okay now lets move on to the next segment which is determining the winner so we add a line bre and here we can check if user choice is the same as computer choice then we print tai elif or al if now here we want to implement the scenario where the user wins there are three scenarios one is user choice is rock and computer choice is scissors in this case we want to print uin theres another scenario where user choice is scissors and computer choice is paper again here we can print you win but there is a better way we can combine these two statements into a single statement using the logical or operator so this is one scenario or one condition where the user wins as you can see ive selected this expression now we type left bracket so the entire expression is now surrounded by parenthesis right after we type or now here we should select our second condition again we type a left bracket to surround this with parentheses now we select the entire expression cut it and put it right here now similarly we type another or operator and add the third condition and that is user choice equals p or paper and computer choice equals rock so if any of these conditions is true the user wins otherwise the user loses okay now this line is getting a little bit too long so to make our code more readable we can break it down into multiple lines so right after this or operator we add a line bre now here we have an error saying expected expression because python interpreter expects a colon here so to tell the interpreter that this is a multiline statement here we add a backslash okay now to better format our code its better to line up all these conditions so we put this on a new line add tab again on this line we add a backslash now these two conditions are perfectly align now similarly lets add another backslash and put this condition on a new line now what is happening here we had an extra white space okay were good so this is one way to break this code down into multiple lines but all these backs slashes are kind of ugly let me show you a better way look here we have three conditions each surrounded by parenthesis now we can grab all these three conditions and wrap them with parenthesis like this we can remove the backslash here we add parenthesis so the left one is here and the right one should be at the end right here with this we no longer need these back slashes anymore so python interpreter knows that the this outer parenthesis represents a long expression okay so were almost there we determine the winner next we should ask the user if they want to continue so once again we add a line break to separate this segment from the previous segment which is about determining the winner and then use the input function to ask the user if they want to continue or not so right away we call the lower method and then store the result in a variable like should continue we cannot use the word continue because this is a reserved keyword in python okay so here we check if should continue equals n then we want to terminate the program now to do this first we have to add these statements inside a y loop so here we add a y loop with true as the condition now lets indent all these lines so if the user types an n then we want to break out of this loop to terminate the program otherwise if they type why or anything else we can treat it as yes so lets run our program first lets try an invalid choice like a all right our program crashed on this line line 13 where we try to show the emoji associated with the users choice now obviously in this dictionary dictionary of emojis up here we dont have a key with the value of a right so look down here we validating the users choice if the user types an invalid choice we just print an error message but the rest of the code gets executed so we end up on this line and this line throws an exception to fix this issue right after printing an error we should use the contin contin statement to jump back to the beginning of the y loop so we ask the user one more time to make a choice lets try it one more time if i type an a we get an error message and our program doesnt crash beautiful lets try again b great now if i type r i chose rock computer chose scissors and i want beautiful now shall we continue if i type yes i get a chance to make another choice lets go with p i chose paper computer chose rock so i want again great now if i type in our program terminates all right our program is working but just because its working it doesnt mean our work is finished we should always review our code and find opportunities to refine and improve it in coding this is called refactoring its basically a fancy term for changing the structure of our code without changing its functional ity in this lesson were going to look at a common refactoring technique called modularization modularizing code means breaking down a large program into smaller reusable parts called modules or functions think of it like organizing a messy room into different boxes each holding specific items instead of having one big pile of everything we put related things together making it easier to find what we need and keep things tidy now back to this code earlier we talked about different segments in our program so we have a segment for displaying choices we have another segment for determining winner and so on now were going to extract these segments into small functions each having a single responsibility let me show you how we do this so we start from the top these few lines have a single responsibility and that is getting the users choice so we can extract these few lines into a separate function called get user choice so up here after we declare our emojis and choices lets define a function called get user choice always use descriptive names for your functions okay now lets move these few lines inside this function now here we have an error because the continue keyword can only be used inside the loop so here we need to add a y loop while true then we move these view lines inside this loop so if the user enters an invalid choice we print an error and then continue which means we jump to the beginning of the y loop otherwise we break out of this loop and at the end we should return a value from this function what value users choice so here we use the return statement to return user choice now there is a better way to write this code instead of breaking out of this loop we can return users choice right here so return user choice with this we can make our function slightly shorter okay now let me show you what happens if we swap these if and else statements so instead of checking if user choice is not in the list of choices we check if user choice is in the list of choices in this case were going to return immediately so return user choice otherwise we are going to print an error message and continue okay now with this implementation we dont even need the continue keyword because if we end up here we print an error and then the control automatically moves to the beginning of the y loop so we can get rid of the continue statement and make our code slightly shorter okay now back to our main y loop earlier we had a few lines for getting users input those lines are now inside the get user choice function so here we call get user choice get the result and store it in a variable called user choice okay next were going to apply the same technique to these two lines these two lines are highly related and have a single responsibility displaying choices so lets select these two lines cut now after this function we define another function called display choices good now back to our y loop right here we call display choices okay next we need to extract this f lines for determining the winner again select cut lets define a new function determine winner now here we have an error because we need to add indentation here good now back to our y loop after we display the choices we call determine winner good now we can do the same thing with our y loop so we can extract this entire logic and put it into a separate function lets call that play game this is where we have our game logic lets select all this code and add ination good so heres the end result now if you look up here we have a bunch of errors because in this function display choices we do not have a variable called user choice this variable is declared inside our play game function so to fix this issue we have to pass user choice and computer choice to these functions so we go to our display choices function and give it two parameters user choice and computer choice now the errors are gone similarly in determine winner we add two parameters user choice and computer choice the errors are gone beautiful now when calling these functions we should pass these values as arguments user choice and computer choice one more time user choice and computer choice good now one last thing if we run our program nothing happens because after this refactoring we move different lines of our code inside different functions but currently none of these functions is getting called so at the end we have to call the play game function so our program starts lets run it one more time there you go lets enter an invalid choice its still working lets type r our program is working and lets terminate it beautiful so with this refactoring we broke down our program into small reusable functions each of these functions has only a few lines so if there is a bug in one of these functions we can only focus on those few lines this is easier than reading and understanding an entire script this is the benefit of modularizing music code we have one more opportunity for improving this code look there are multiple places where we have defined our choices this is bad for two reasons one reason is that if we have a typo in our code our program is not going to work thats number one problem the second problem is that if tomorrow we decide to change our choices from r s and p to something else like 1 2 and three there are multiple places that we have to modify in programming we have this principle called dry which is short for dont repeat yourself so we dont want to have repetition or duplication in our code most of the time its a bad practice practice so how can we solve this problem well we can generate this top hole based on this dictionary in this dictionary we have three key value pairs our keys are r s and p so let me show you how we can convert this dictionary to a tople with these values first im going to select this line and the rest of the code now we can convert all these lines to a comment by pressing command and slash on mac or control and slash on windows now all these lines are commented out so theyre not going to get executed we only have the declaration of our dictionary now lets print emojis dot look here we have a method called keys which returns the keys of this dictionary using this structure dict keys let me show you so back to the terminal lets run our program all right heres what we get we get an object of type dict keys or dictionary keys and here we have r s and p but this is not exactly what we want what we want is a topple but this is very easy to fix we can pass the object that is returned from this method to the topple function and with this we get a top hole exactly like the top hole that we declared here so we can set choices to top hole of emojis do keys okay with this technique we remov duplication in our code now lets bring back all the code here so one more time we press command and slash on mac or control and slash on windows okay now look there are other places where we have repeated our choices again if we have a typo our program is not going to work so realistically we need a single place for defining our choices to do that we can go to the top and declare a bunch of constants by convention we use uppercase letters to declare constants so we can declare a constant like rock and set it to r similarly scissors and paper this is a single place where we declare our choices now anywhere we have r s and p we replace them with our constants so i have selected r here now to select the next occurrence of r in this code we press command and d on mac or control and d on windows look this instance is also selected one more time we press command and d there you go now we have three cursors all of them selecting r so we can replace them all with rock in one go now to cancel multic cursor editing we press the escape button twice okay one more time were going to select s we press command and d twice to select these two instances as well and replace this with scissors again we press the skape button twice done and the last one paper okay now we have a single place where we have defined our choices so no chance for typos and if we decide to change the choices from rs and p to something else in the future there is a single place we have to update we can change this to one two and three and everything will work okay but there is another benefit here look down here where we determine the winner our code is more descriptive so instead of comparing user choice and computer choice with r and s we can clearly see that if the user has a rock and the computer has scissors the user is the winner hey there i hope youve been enjoying this video so far if youre finding this helpful and want to take your python skills even further ive got something really exciting for you this video is just a taste of what you will find in my full course python projects for beginners in the full course we dive deep into more projects covering a wide range of concepts that will help you sharpen your problem solving skills and become a confident python programmer if youre ready to level up check out the link below to get access to the full course i would love to see you there and help you on your python journey all right for our next project were going to build a qr code generator so first we enter some text or url im going to enter the address of my website code with moscom next we enter a file name lets enter mjpg now we have a qr code saved in this file this file is right here so this is the qr code for my we it if you scan this with your phone it will open your browser and take you to my website now to build this were going to use a thirdparty library called qr code so head over to porg proqr code read the documentation for this library the purpose of this project is to get you familiar with using thirdparty libraries so this project doesnt have really complex logic its all about the right way to use third party packages so i spend a few minutes to go through the documentation then install this library and build this project all right the first thing were going to do is set up a virtual environment a virtual environment in python is like a separate isolated workspace on your computer where you can install packages and run python projects think of it as a clean organized room thats separate from the rest of your house in this room you have everything you need to work on a specific project without affecting anything else in the house now why do we need a virtual environment well imagine youre working on two different python projects one project needs an older version of a library and the other project needs a newer version if you install both versions globally for the whole computer they might conflict with each other a virtual environment solves this problem by allowing each project to have its own separate environment with its own specific versions of libraries okay so to set up a virtual environment here we open the terminal window and type python if youre on windows or python 3 if youre on mac then we typem that is short for module were going to run this module vm thats one of the builtin modules in python for creating virtual environments and then we specify a name for our virtual environment by convention we often use vmv as well okay now vs code is saying we noticed a new virtual environment has been created do you want to selected for the workspace folder for now select no we come back to this later now take a look at the project directory we have this new folder here vm and inside this we have a bunch of folders like bin include and lip inside the bin folder we have executables like pip pip 3 python python 3 and so on now if youre a bit more experienced and are familiar with git you can see that we have over a th000 files ready to be committed to our repository we dont want to include these files in our repository so to exclude them here in the root of our project we add a new file called dogit ignore in this file we add the files and folders we want to exclude from our git repository in this case vn folder so we add a forward slash here okay now if youre not familiar with git dont worry about it just ignore this step for now okay so we have created a virtual environment but current l its not active so we go back to the terminal to activate it if youre on windows you type vm back slash scripts back slash activate if youre on mac you type source vn slash bin sl activate okay now look this virtual environment is activated so any packages that we install will be installed in this virtual environment or in this isolated workspace when we are done with this project we can deactivate this virtual environment by typing deactivate okay now lets activate it one more time good now in this virtual environment were going to install the qr code package all right good with this installed now we add a new file to our project qr code generator pi first we import the qr code module next we use the input function and tell the user to enter some text or url we get the result and store it in a variable called data next we use the input function to get a file name so enter the file name and rest store it here now its a good practice to remove any white spaces around what the user types for example what if the user types lets say the address of my website as the url whether they type this address or this address followed by a whites space we want to have the same qr code generator so over here we can call the strip method to get rid of any white spaces around our data okay similarly i would like to strip any white spaces around the file name good now we ready to generate our qr code to do that we go in the qr code module and create create a qr code object here we want to set two parameters one is box size im going to set it to 10 these are just arbitrary values im going to set border to four this returns a qr code object we store it in this variable next we call qr add data then we pass our data next we call qr make image and set two arguments here one is fill color which im going to set to black again these are arbitrary values you can use any colors you want we also set back color to white this returns an image that we store in a variable and finally we call image saave to save it in this file and at the end we print qr code saved as now here we want to add the file name so lets convert this to a formatted string and insert the file name here now lets run our program so im going to enter the address of my website code with mcom and for the file name im going to enter mjpg okay now look in this folder we have mh jpg this is my qr code so if you point your phone at this and scan it this will open your browser and take you to my website hey there i hope youve been enjoying this video so far if

your skills youre in the right place today im sharing the complete devops road map ill walk you through the essential skills you need the tools i personally recommend and how much time you should spend on each assuming you dedicate 3 to 5 hours of studying every day this road map should take you about 10 to 14 months to complete lets jump right in first off we have linux fundamentals linux is the backbone of servers and dev vment environments as a devops engineer youll be setting up and maintaining the infrastructure where applications run most servers use linux so getting comfortable with it especially the command line is crucial i recommend starting with learning bash which is the most commonly used shell and scripting language in linux spend about 2 to 3 weeks on this make sure to learn basic linux commands for working with the file system permissions and ownership processes and signals as well as managing packages next you need to learn networking concepts networking is all about how computers communicate with each other think ip addresses and protocols you need to understand how data moves around security and troubleshoot network issues to get handson experience i recommend using wihar dedicate around two weeks on this make sure to learn concepts like osi and tcpip models ip addressing and subnetting dns and dhcp networking protocols like http https ftp and ssh firewalls and security groups and basic network troubleshooting using tools like ping trace route and net stat now lets talk about git git is a version control system that lets you track changes in your code and collaborate with others its essential for working on projects with a team and managing your code effectively spend one to two weeks getting comfortable with git make sure to learn basic git commands like clone commit push and pull branching and merging resolving merge conf working with remote repositories and so on after that you should dive into programming languages programming languages like python ruby and go are used to automate tasks and manage configurations while there are several other languages i personally recommend python for its simplicity powerful libraries and versatility dedicate four to 6 weeks to build a solid foundation in python make sure to learn python syntax and data structures like lists dictionaries sets and topples modules and packages learn how to write and execute python scripts work with files handle errors write automation scripts and so on by the way to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box also i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning again links are in the description box moving on lets talk about cloud providers cloud providers like aws azure and google cloud platform offer a range of services for building and deploying applications if youre just starting out i recommend focusing on one cloud provider and aws is a great choice because its the most widely used spend about 4 to 6 weeks on this make sure to learn how to launch configure and manage virtual servers store and manage data get familiar with is managing users groups and roles and how to set up and manage isolated networks next up is containerization containerization is all about packaging an application and its dependencies into a container to ensure it runs the same everywhere docker is the goto tool for this spend about 3 to four weeks getting comfortable with docker learn how to create docker images get familiar with starting stopping and managing containers learn how to write docker files explore how to define and run multicontainer applications using docker compos and so on now lets dive into continuous integration and deployment or cicd cicd automates the integration and deployment of code changes allowing for frequent and reliable releases genkins is a powerful tool for setting up cicd pipelines but other popular tools include gitlab cicd circle ci and travis c if youre starting out just focus on jenkins for its versatility and strong community support dedicate 3 to four weeks on this make sure to understand how to create and manage jenkins pipelines get familiar with writing jenkins files learn how to integrate automated tests into your pipelines understand how to automate the build process for your applications explore how to automate the deployment of your applications to various environments and so on moving forward lets discuss orchestration and management orchestration tools like kubernetes and helm help automate the deployment scaling and management of containerized applications these tools are essential for managing complex applications in production start with kubernetes and spend about four to 6 weeks on it make sure to learn about the overall architecture including the master node and worker nodes and how they interact understand the key components such as pods services and deployments get familiar with managing resources learn how to scale your applications as well as the networking model in kubernetes next we have networking and infrastructure services this involves setting up and managing services like reverse proxes forward proxes caching servers firewalls and load balancers i recommend using engine x for handling reverse proxes and load balancing give this

essential skills you need to master lets dive in and check them out one by one data science is all about analyzing and interpreting complex data to provide actionable insights as a data scientist youll need to get good at a bunch of different skills from programming and math to data handling and visualization lets jump in first up you need to get the hang of python its the main language in data science and its pretty easy to pick up you can get a decent grasp of it in about a month or two then theres r its another popular language in data science start with python because its super versatile and once youre comfortable with it you can dive into r for its cool statistical and visualization features next you need to learn git git isnt a programming language its a version control system we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git has a ton of features but you dont need to learn them all think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gs features 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running next you need to dive into data structures and algorithms understanding these concepts will boost your problem solving skills which is key for tackling complex challenges plus speak take companies like google amazon and facebook always ask about them in job interviews spend about a month or two on this and youll be in great shape next you need to get comfortable with sql sql stands for structured query language its a very very simple language we use for working with databases as a data scientist you should know how to use sql to access organize and analyze the data you need sql is pretty simple and you can get a decent grasp of it in about a month or two by the way to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill its a great resource to review your progress find gaps your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box also i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning again links are in the description box next you need a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics this is crucial because data science relies heavily on these principles focus on linear algebra calculus probability and statistics these will help you understand data analysis techniques and how to interpret data correctly spend about 2 to 3 months mastering these topics im after that you need to get good at preparing and visualizing data this means cleaning up the data and organizing it in a way that makes it easy to analyze youll need to learn python libraries like pandas and numpy to manipulate and clean the data once your data is clean you need to visualize it to understand patterns and communicate results libraries like matte plot lip and seaborn help you create insightful visualizations to identify trends and anomalies also why not strictly necessary getting familiar with business intelligence tools like tableau or powerbi can give you an edge because these tools are widely used in the industry for creating interactive and sharable dashboards if you already have a solid background in python and sql you can get a good grasp of data preprocessing and visualization in a month or two next up youll need to get a handle on machine learning fundamentals machine learning algorithms fall into two categories supervised and unsupervised in supervised learning the model learns from labeled data meaning each input comes with a known output in unsupervised learning the model works with unlabel data and tries to figure out patterns and relationships on its own its important to learn about these types of algorithms and how they work youll also need to get familiar with tools like tensor flow pytorch and psyit learn which are used to build and train machine learning models dedicate about 3 to 4 months to master the core machine learning concepts and how to use the these tools effectively after youve got the basics of machine learning down its time to explore deep learning deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers thats why we call it deep these networks are great for handling more complex tasks like image and speech recognition start with understanding the basics of neural networks and then move on to more advanced architectures like cnns and rnns tools like tensor flow and pie torch are also essential here spend about 2 to 3 months getting a good grasp of deep learning concepts and how to implement them all right at this point youve got a solid foundation in data science its like you have become a general doctor now doctors often specialize in different areas like the heart or kidneys similarly you should consider specializing in exciting fields like natural language processing also called nlp or computer vision nlp is all about working with text and language data its used for things like analyzing sentiments in text translating languages and creating chat pods like chat gpt computer vision on the other hand is about teaching computers to understand and interpret visual data like images and videos its used in facial recognition detecting objects and even in selfdriving cars now you dont need to learn them both unless youre very enthusiastic so pick the one that interests you the most spend two to 3 months diving deep into one of these areas now as you move forward in your data science path there might come a time when you need to work with massive data sets thats where big data comes in big data is all about handling and processing huge amounts of data quickly tools like hadoop and spark are super handy for this spend 2 to 3 months getting the hang of these tools and youll be able to spot patterns and trends that you wouldnt catch with smaller data sets so if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can follow this road map and pick up all the skills you need to apply for an entrylevel data science job in about 12 to 20 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below and i will do

developer web development is generally broken down into two areas frontend development and backend development and then full stack development which is a combination of both frontend development is all about what the user sees and interacts with its the website in your browser or the app on your mobile phone or tablet backend development handles everything behind the scenes like data processing storage and logic you can start on either end but if youre starting out and pursuing a career in web development i recommend you to start with the backand because it gives you a solid foundation in programming and problem solving plus when you transition from back end to front end youll have a deep understanding of what happens under the hood in contrast if you start with the front end back end looks like a mystery and youll have no idea whats really happening under the hood so in this video first were going to cover the skills you need to become a backend developer and then well talk about frontend development to become a backend developer there are five essential skills lets go over them one by one the first step to learning backend development is to pick up a programming language here we have a few options like javascript python ruby java c and go just to name a few now which one is the best well its almost impossible to pick one language as the best or the ultimate language because the choice of language depends on various factors like project requirements team expertise and performance needs for example javascript is used for full stack development because we can use it on both the front end and the back end in contrast python and ruby are often used for rapid prototyping and fast development cycles java and c are often used in building large scale enterprise grade applications theyre heavily used in large organizations and government systems and go is used for performance critical and concurrent applications now the common mistake i see among my students is that they try to learn many of these languages hoping that this would increase their job opportunities but it doesnt work that way because learning a language is only the first step you also need to learn the ecosystem of tools and libraries for that language to land a job so if youre starting out just stick to one language whichever you like but also do a bit of research and see how many job opportunities are available for that language where you live generally speaking there are often more job opportunities for python java and javascript but again i want you to do your own research now assuming that there are more job opportunities is for these three languages in your town and youre not sure what language to start with i would recommend python because its the easiest and has a simple readable syntax thats great for beginners my second choice is java because its a solid language and is often taught to computer science and software engineering students javascript has a ton of weird parts and baggage from the past because it wasnt originally built for building backends we can certainly use it to build great backends and ive done that many times but i still prefer java or or c to javascript for building backends so dont overthink this pick a language and dedicate 2 months to learning it if you spend 3 to 5 hours every day studying and coding you can learn any of these languages in about 2 months now to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box by the way i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a version control system like git git is not a programming language its a tool that we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and github which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer git has a ton of features but you dont need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gits features so one to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building backends often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of selftaught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fundamentals of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and theyre often covered in tech interviews especially at big tech companies like apple google and microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people i highly recommend you not overlook this step otherwise youre going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to two months studying classic computer science data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing ill recommend to learn which a lot of selftaught people miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns that were documented in this classic book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in web frameworks particularly spring django and asnet core which we will talk about in a few minutes so learning these design patterns will give you a deeper understanding of objectoriented design principles and how these frameworks work under the hood now i got to tell you this book is pretty old and its written in c honestly its a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to modern software thats why ive created a very handson and pragmatic course on this topic where i use java and modern examples that you find in applications we use every day so you can see how these design patterns are used to solve problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or a different resource i believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months the next thing you need to learn is understanding and designing databases there are two classes of database engines relational and nonrelational also called no sql databases in relational databases data is stored in tables with rows and columns that are related thats why we call them relational databases these databases are best for applications that require complex queries and transactions like banking systems and ecommerce applications especially any application that needs complex reporting examples of relational database engines are mysql postgress sql server and oracle these are different products that despite some differences work more or less the same way with all these products we retrieve or store data using a language called sql some people call it sql which is short for structured query language its a simple language that looks like plain english now you dont need to learn all these database engines because different projects and teams use different database engines when youre starting out you just need to learn one of them and you can easily pick up others on the job out of these i would recommend mysql because its the most popular database engine but you can pick any other database engine that you like one month is enough to learn the essence of sql and working with a relational database now in no sql databases data is stored without a predefined table structure so these databases are more flexible theyre best for applications that require flexible data models and realtime analytics examples include mongod db couch db and cassandra again these are several products out there and you dont have to learn all of them out of these i would recommend mongodb because its the most popular and you can learn it in about a month youre not going to be an expert but youre going to have a decent practical knowledge the next thing you need to learn is a web framework which depends on your programming language for python you should learn jango for java you should learn spring boot for javascript you should learn expressjs for c you should learn as net core for ruby you should learn ruby on rails and for go you should learn j all these frameworks more or less do the same thing they provide a bunch of tools for building backends handling tasks like routing requests and response handling database interaction and security in a nutshell with these frameworks we can build and publish application programming interfaces or apis these apis are essentially communication points between front ends and backends allowing front ends to retrieve or post data to backends if you have a solid background in a programming language and databases you can learn any of these frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicate a few hours every day and follow this road map youll have the necessary knowledge to apply for entrylevel backend developer jobs in about 12 months now lets talk about the essential languages and technologies you need for frontend development frontend development is built on three core languages html css and javascript html or hypertext markup language is used for structuring web pages we can define headings paragraphs images links and more its quite simple and if you dedicate a few hours a day you can learn the basics in a week or two the next thing you need to learn is css or cascading stylesheets css is used for styling web pages it allows us to control colors fonts layouts and so on it helps create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes with a few hours of practice a day you can learn the essence of css in 2 to 4 weeks you wont be an expert but youll have practical knowledge to apply in your projects as you work on different projects you will learn additional techniques along the way the next thing you need to learn is javascript and this is where programming starts html and css are for structuring and styling pages but programming is about logic its about algorithms and this is where javascript comes in with javascript we can make our web pages interactive we can handle user clicks validate form data show popups get data from the back end and basically bring our website to life now if you have never programmed before this might be the most challenging part of your journey because you have to learn how to think like a programmer it might feel weird at the beginning but with continuous study and consistent practice im sure you can get a reasonable grasp of it in about 2 months the next thing you need to learn is typescript its a language thats built on top of javascript that adds static typing and additional features allowing us to write more robust code these days most companies prefer typescript for large scale applications so if you want to land a frontend developer job in 2024 and beyond typescript is a must know its relatively small compared to javascript and you can get up and running in about 2 to 3 weeks next on our list is a ui or user interface library or framework a ui framework is for building user interfaces using reusable components or building blocks examples include react angular view and so on react is the most popular and has a ton of job opportunities so if youre looking to land a frontend developer job react is your best bet now to learn react effectively you need to have a solid understanding of javascript and basic grasp of typescript because most react projects these days use typescript so make sure to build a strong foundation in javascript before diving into react otherwise youre going to face numerous challenges with a solid understanding of javascript you can get up and running with react in about 2 months then you can explore other options like angular or view to add to your resume focus on one framework at a time learn it properly do a few projects and once you have a solid understanding you can learn other frameworks if you wish so thats the core of front and development these skills are listed on nearly every job description and with continuous learning and consistent practice you can learn them all in about 6 months but i got to be honest with you frontend development is competitive so to truly stand out there are additional skills you need to learn to increase your job opportunities so lets go over them one by one you learn that with css we can style web pages and make them beautiful now as our projects grow and get more complex styling pages using plain css can become painful and messy so over time many solutions have been created to address this problem one of them is css preprocessors which allow us to write css in a more efficient syntax using additional features and then compile it down to plain css examples include sas les and stylus different projects use different tools and you dont need to learn all of these to apply for a front and developer job if youre familiar with one of them you can quickly learn others on the job out of these i would suggest sas because its the most popular and a good one to start with one to two weeks is enough to get up and running with sas another approach to writing manageable css is using a css framework a css framework provides prewritten css that we can use in our applications some of the popular ones are bootstrap tailwind foundation skeleton and so on now as you can see here on npm trends bootstrap used to be very popular and a lot of projects are still using it but over the past couple of years tailwind has been emerging and overtaken bootstrap so a lot of newer projects particularly react projects use tailwind so out of these i recommend learning tailwind its not that complicated and you can get a decent grasp of it in about 2 to 4 weeks another key skill that employeers are looking for especially in senior developers is automated testing with automated testing we can write code to test our code and make sure it functions correctly automated testing minimizes bugs and enhances the overall quality of our applications there are many testing frameworks out there but the two most popular ones are just and v test which are pretty similar so once you learn one of them you can learn the other pretty quickly just is the most popular one but it has some baggage so newer projects often use vest again theyre very similar and you can start with either of them i believe 3 to four weeks is enough to learn the essence of just and automated testing principles next on our list is meta frameworks a meta framework is a higher level framework that sits on top of a core ui library or framework and enhances its cap abilities its not something that all employers are looking for because its only used in newer projects a lot of older projects dont use a meta framework but if you want to have a competitive edge if youre looking for a better position with a better salary i would recommend learning a meta framework for react applications we have nextjs which is the more popular option and remix i recommend learning nextjs which you can master in 4 to 6 weeks if you have a strong foundation in react so that really sums up the essential schem deals you need to become a frontend developer if you have any questions please let me know in the

nine essential skills you need to master lets go over them one by one now machine learning involves creating models that learn from data to make predictions or decisions as a machine learning engineer youll need to master various skills from programming and math to deploying models first up you need to get proficient with python its the primary language used in machine learning its pretty simple and you can get a decent grasp of it in about a month or two now some jobs might ask for other languages like java r or c for performance reasons but as a beginner just stick to python dont overwhelm yourself by trying to learn everything at once focus on mastering python first the next thing you need to learn is a version control system like git git is not a programming language its a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git has a ton of features but you dont need to learn all of them think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gs features so one to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running next you need to dive into data structures and algorithms i know a lot of selftaught engineers skip this step but trust me its super important first off understanding these concepts will really boost your problem solving skills which is key for tackling complex challenges plus big tech companies like google amazon and facebook love to ask about data structures and algorithms in job interviews also using the right data structures helps you manage large data sets efficiently and keeps your algorithms running smoothly so spend about a month or two on this and youll be in a great shape next you need to get comfortable with sql sql stands for structured query language its a very simple language we use for working with databases as a machine learning engineer you should know how to use sql to access and organize the data you need for your models sql is pretty simple and you can get a decent grasp of it in about a month or two now by the way to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box also i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for a structured learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need is a solid foundation in mathematics and statistics this is crucial because machine learning algorithms are built on these principles focus on linear algebra calculus probability and statistics these will help you understand how machine learning algorithms work and how to optimize them spend about 2 to 3 months to master these topics after that you need to get good at preparing and visualizing data for your models this means cleaning up the data and organizing it in a way that makes it easy for your model to understand youll need to learn how to use tools like pandas and numpy to manipulate and clean the data once your data is clean you need to visualize it to understand patterns and communicate results python libraries like matplot lip and seaborn will help you create insightful visualizations to identify trends and anomalies if you have a solid background in python and sql you can get a good grasp of data preprocessing and visualization in a month or two now lets talk about machine learning fundamentals machine learning algorithms fall into two categories supervised and unsupervised in supervised learning the model learns from labeled data meaning each input comes with a known output in unsupervised lear learning the model works with unlabeled data and tries to figure out patterns and relationships on its own its important to learn about these types of algorithms and how they work youll also need to get familiar with tools like tensor flow pie torch and pyed learn these are the essential tools used to build and train machine learning models dedicate about 3 to four months to master the core machine learning concepts and how to use these tools effectively once you have a good understanding of the basics its time to dive into more advanced machine learning concepts this includes techniques like ensemble learning which combines multiple models to improve performance and deep learning which involves neural networks with many layers youll also need to learn about natural language processing or nlp for working with text data and computer vision for working with images these advanced topics will help you tackle more complex problems and build more sophisticated models spend about 2 to 3 months on these advanced concepts to deepen your knowledge and skills finally you need to know how to put the models you build into action this means learning how to create simple web services that let other applications use your models you can do this by learning python frameworks like flask or django you should also learn about docker which is a tool that makes it easy to package your model and all its dependencies so it runs smoothly on any machine think of it like packing everything your model needs into a box so it works anywhere you take it spend one to two months mastering these basics so you can confidently deploy your models and make them available for real word use so if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can follow this road map and pick up all the skills you need to apply for entrylevel machine learning jobs in about 12 to 20 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below ill do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos if you enjoy this video please give it a like and subscribe for more useful

skills lets go over them one by one there are basically two ways to build mobile apps native or crossplatform with native development we can build an app that runs only on a particular platform like ios or android this approach gives us full control over the capabilities of the target platform resulting in great performance and the best user experience however the downside is that if you want to build the same app for a different platform form we have to create a separate project in an entirely different language and ecosystem this means two separate projects and two sets of bugs to fix thats where crossplatform or multiplatform development comes to the rescue with crossplatform development we can reduce development time by reusing the same code for different platforms and potentially reduce bugs fixing a bug once means its fixed across multiple platforms now for native development we have a few options for ios we can use objective c which is an older language or swift which is modern and preferred for android we can use java which is a traditional language or cotland which is modern and preferred for crossplatform development the option depends on the framework or toolkit we use there are several crossplatform toolkits like react native flutter cotland multiplatform maui and a few others lets dive into each one first off we have react native which was released by facebook in 2015 this toolkit lets you build mobile apps using javascript and and react which is a popular library for building web user interfaces some big names using react native include microsoft office scype and even facebook itself then we have flut which is a google product that came out in 2017 flut uses a programming language called dart which takes the best parts of javascript java and c some examples of apps built with flutter are ebay alibaba and google pay its really powerful and gaining a lot of traction now lets talk about cotland multiplatform this is the newest player released by jetbrains the same company behind tools like intellig pycharm and webstorm in my opinion the best idees in the world it uses the cotlin programming language which is a modern language inspired by java apps like mcdonalds netflix and cash app are built with cotton multiplatform finally we have maui which stands for net multiplatform appui introduced by microsoft maui allows you to build native mobile and desktop apps using c and net these days most companies prefer to use multiplatform development to reduce their costs this means we can rule out native development for now and focus on crossplatform options now which framework is the best well there is no such a thing as the best framework yes there are people out there like our superstar highly opinionated developer mr john smith who swears by react native but there are others with a different opinion the reality is that neither of these frameworks is perfect each has its own problems and quirks that you you will discover once you start building real applications beyond youtube tutorials and the reason for that is that they try to support two entirely different platforms at the same time so which crossplatform solution should you choose well it depends on two things first on what languages and technologies youre familiar with for example if youre a c developer maui might be the easier route if you know web technologies like javascript and react you might want to go for react native its an easier transition from web to mobile development the other factor is job opportunities there are often more jobs available for react native and flutter here you can see the number of open positions for different types of mobile app developers in the us now this is the current situation here and maybe different where you live maybe there are more job opportunities for a flutter developer so i recommend doing your own research rather than taking my or someone elses advice about which route to choose but realistically if youre looking for a career in mobile development you would have to choose between react native and flutter if you have basic web development skills react native is a better route otherwise i would recommend flutter because dart which is the programming language that flutter uses is a nicer language to work with than javascript its more modern and doesnt have the quirks and weird parts you find in javascript so decide between javascript or dart and commit to a study plan i believe if you dedicate 3 to 5 hours every day you can learn the essence of either of these languages in about 2 months to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box by the way i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structur learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a version control system them like git git is not a programming language its a tool we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and github which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer now git has a ton of features but you dont need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gits features 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building mobile apps often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of selftaught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fundamentals of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and theyre often covered in tech interviews especially at big companies like apple google and microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people i highly recommend you not to overlook this step otherwise youre going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to 2 months studying classic data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing i would recommend learning which again a lot of selftaught developers miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns documented in the book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in mobile frameworks so learning them will give you a deeper understanding of objectoriented design principles and how these mobile frameworks work under the hood now i have to tell you this book is pretty old and written in c honestly its a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to modern software thats why ive created a very handson and pragmatic course on this topic where i use java and modern examples found in applications we use every day you can see how design patterns are used to solve problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or use a different resource i believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months all right the next thing you need to learn is a mobile framework which we talked about before for dart you should learn flutter and for javascript you should learn react native assuming you have a solid background in programming you can learn either of these frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicated a few hours every day and follow this road map youll have the necessary knowledge to apply for an entrylevel mobile developer job in about 8 to 12 months if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below ill do my best to answer you right here or in my

skills lets go over them one by one the first step to learning backend development is to pick up a programming language here we have a few options like javascript python ruby java c and go just to name a few now which one is the best well its almost impossible to pick one language as the best or the ultimate language because the choice of language depends on various factors like project requirements team expertise and performance needs for example javascript is used for full stack development because we can use it on both the front end and the back end in contrast python and ruby are often used for rapid prototyping and fast development cycles java and c are often used in building large scale enterprise grade applications theyre heavily used in large organizations and government systems and go is used for performance critical and concurrent applications now a common mistake i see among my students is that they try to learn learn many of these languages hoping that this would increase their job opportunities but it doesnt work that way because learning a language is only the first step you also need to learn the ecosystem of tools and libraries for that language to land a job so if youre starting out just stick to one language whichever you like but also do a bit of research and see how many job opportunities are available for that language where you live generally speaking there are often more job opportunities for python java and javascript but again i want want you to do your own research now assuming that there are more job opportunities for these three languages in your town and youre not sure what language to start with i would recommend python because its the easiest and has a simple readable syntax thats great for beginners my second choice is java because its a solid language and is often taught to computer science and software engineering students javascript has a ton of weird parts and baggage from the past because it wasnt originally built for building backends we can certainly use it to build great backends and ive done that many times but i still prefer java or c to javascript for building backends so dont overthink this pick a language and dedicate 2 months to learning it if you spend 3 to 5 hours every day studying and coding you can learn any of these languages in about 2 months now to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box by the way i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning again links are in the description box the next thing you need to learn is a version control system like git git is not a programming language its a tool that we use to track changes to our code and collaborate with others git and github which is a platform that hosts git repositories are essential for every developer git has a ton of features but you dont need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gits features so 1 to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running now building backends often involves working with data structures and implementing complex algorithms this is where a lot of selftaught programmers struggle because they try to skip ahead and learn more and more languages and tools without learning the fun alss of computer science data structures and algorithms are critical subjects taught to computer science students and theyre often covered in tech interviews especially at big tech companies like apple google and microsoft while you can skip this step and go to the next as someone who has had the privilege of teaching millions of people i highly recommend you not overlook this step otherwise youre going to feel the pain later in your career so spend 1 to two months studying classic computer science data structures and algorithms this will give you a strong foundation in programming and problem solving the next thing i would recommend to learn which a lot of selftaught people miss is design patterns design patterns are proven solutions to common software design problems there are 23 classic design patterns that were documented in this classic book design patterns by the gang of four many of these patterns are used in web frameworks particularly springing django and asnet core which well talk about in a few minutes so learning these design patterns will give you a deeper understanding of objectoriented design principles and how these frameworks work under the hood now i got to tell you this book is pretty old and its written in c honestly its a difficult read because many of the examples in the book are dry and not quite relevant to modern software thats why ive created a very handson and pragmatic course on this topic where i use java and modern examples that you find in applications we use every day so you can see how these design patterns are used to solve problem problems in modern applications whether you want to take my course or a different resource i believe if you dedicate a few hours every day you can have a pretty solid understanding of design patterns in about 2 months the next thing you need to learn is understanding and designing databases there are two classes of database engines relational and nonrelational also called nosql databases in relational databases data is stored in tables with rows and columns that are related thats why we call them relational databases these databases are best for applications that require complex queries and transactions like banking systems and ecommerce applications especially any application that needs complex reporting examples of relational database engines are mysql postgress sql server and oracle these are different products that despite some differences work more or less the same way with all these products you retrieve or store data using a language called sql some people call it sql which is short for structured query language its a simple language that looks like plain english now you dont need to learn all these database engines because different projects and teams use different database engines when youre starting out you just need to learn one of them and you can easily pick up others on the job out of these i would recommend mysql because its the most popular database engine but you can pick any other database engine that you like one month is enough to learn the essence of sql and working with a relational database now in no sql databases data is stored without a predefined table structure so these databases are more flexible theyre best for applications that require flexible data models and realtime analytics examples include mongodb couch db and cassandra again these are several products out there and you dont have to learn all of them out of these i would recommend mongodb because its the most popular and you can learn it in about a month youre not going to be an expert but youre going to have a decent practical knowledge the next thing you need to learn is a web framework which depends on your programming language for python you should learn d jango for java you should learn spring boot for javascript you should learn expressjs for c you should learn asnet core for ruby you should learn ruby on rails and for go you should learn j all these frameworks more or less do the same thing they provide a bunch of tools for building backends handling tasks like routing request and response handling database interaction and security in a nutshell with these frameworks we can build and publish application programming interfaces or apis these apis are essentially communication points between frontends and backends allowing frontends to retrieve or post data to backends if you have a solid background in a programming language and databases you can learn any of these frameworks in about 2 months so if you dedicate a few hours every day and follow this road map youll have the necessary knowledge to apply for entry level backend developer jobs in about 12 months now if you want to take your skills to the next level there are of course additional things you should learn ive included them in the pdf i mentioned earlier again the link is in the description if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below and ill do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and subscribe for more

essential skills you need to become a frontend developer whether youre a beginner wanting to know what to learn to land a frontend developer job or someone with some experience looking to level up your skills and filling the gaps this video is for you well cover what each skill is why its important and a realistic timeline for learning it ready lets dive in web development is generally broken down into two areas front end development and backend development and then full stack development which is a combination of both front end development is all about what the user sees and interacts with its the website in your browser or the app on your mobile phone or tablet backend development handles everything behind the scenes like data processing storage and logic in this video our focus is only on frontend development im planning to create a similar video on backend development so check the description box for the link now before we get started lets answer a common question how long does it take to become a frontend developer well the answer varies for everyone but it can take anywhere from 6 to 12 months of consistent studying and practice the key here is consistency and continuous learning to help you on this journey ive created a free supplementary pdf that breaks down the specific concepts you need to learn for each skill it also includes several project ideas to help you practice and apply what you have learned its a great resource to review your progress find gaps in your knowledge and prepare for interviews you can find the link in the description box now lets talk about about the essential languages and technologies you need to learn front and development is built on three core languages html css and javascript html or hypertext markup language is used for structuring web pages we can define headings paragraphs images links and more its quite simple and if you dedicate a few hours a day you can learn the basics in a week or two by the way i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if youre looking for structured learning links are in the description box then next thing you need to learn is css or cascading stylesheets css is used for styling web pages it allows us to control colors fonts layouts and so on it helps create responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes with a few hours of practice a day you can learn the essence of css in 2 to 4 weeks you wont be an expert but youll have practical knowledge to apply in your projects as you work on different projects you will learn additional techniques along the way the next thing you need to learn is javascript and this is is where programming starts html and css are for structuring and styling pages but programming is about logic its about algorithms and this is where javascript comes in with javascript we can make our web pages interactive we can handle user clicks validate form data show popups get data from the back end and basically bring our website to life now if you have never programmed before this might be the most challenging part of your journey because you have to learn how to think like a programmer it might feel weird at the beginning but with contin study and consistent practice im sure you can get a reasonable grasp of it in about 2 months again i have a bunch of tutorials on this channel and complete courses on my website if you prefer structured learning links are in the description box now as we code we need a way to track changes and collaborate with others thats where version control systems particularly git come into play git isnt a programming language its a tool that allows us to track changes to our code and revert to previous versions github on the other hand is one of the many platforms that hosts g repositories enabling us to share our code with others and work in a team environment both skid and github are essential for every developer g has a ton of features but you dont need to know them all for everyday use think of it like the 8020 rule 80 of the time you use 20 of gits features one to two weeks of practice is enough to get up and running the next thing you need to learn is typescript its a language thats built on top of javascript that adds static typing and additional feature allowing us to write more robust code these days most companies prefer typescript for large scale applications so if you want to land a front and developer job in 2024 and beyond typescript is a must know its relatively small compared to javascript and you can get up and running in about 2 to 3 weeks next on our list is a ui or user interface library or framework a ui framework is for building user interfaces using reusable components or building blocks examples incl include react angular view and so on react is the most popular and has a ton of job opportunities so if youre looking to land a front and developer job react is your best bet now to learn react effectively you need to have a solid understanding of javascript and basic grasp of typescript because most react projects these days use typescript so make sure to build a strong foundation in javascript before diving into react otherwise youre going to face numerous challenges with a solid understanding of javascript you can get up and running with react in about 2 months then you can explore other options like angular or view to add to your resume focus on one framework at a time learn it properly do a few projects and once you have a solid understanding you can learn other frameworks if you wish so thats the core of front and development these skills are listed on nearly every job description and with continuous learning and consistent practice you can learn them all in about 6 months but im going to be honest with you front and development is competitive so to truly stand out there are additional skills you need to learn to increase your job opportunities so lets go over them one by one you learn that with css we can style web pages and make them beautiful now as our projects grow and get more complex styling pages using plain css can become painful and messy so over time many solutions have been created to address this problem one of them is css preprocessors which allow us to write css in a more efficient syntax using additional features and then compile it down to plain css examples include sas les and stylus different projects use different tools and you dont need to learn all of these to apply for a frontend developer job if youre familiar with one of them you can quickly learn others on the job out of these i would suggest sas because its the most popular and a good one to start with one to two weeks is enough to get up and running with sas another approach to writing manageable css is using a css framework a css framework provides prewritten css that we can use in our applications some of the popular ones are bootstrap tailwind foundation skeleton and so on now as you can see here on npm trends bootstrap used to be very popular and a lot of projects are still using it but over the past couple of years tailwind has been emerging and overtaking bootstrap so a lot of newer projects particularly react projects use tailwind so out of these i recommend learning tailwind its not that complicated and you can get a decent grasp of it in about two to 4 weeks another key skill that employers are looking for especially in senior developers is automated testing with automated testing we can write code to test our code and make sure it functions correctly automated testing minimizes bugs and enhances the overall quality of our applications there are many testing frameworks out there but the two most popular ones are just and vest which are pretty similar so once you learn one of them you can learn the other pretty quickly just is the most popular one but but it has some baggage so newer projects often use vest again theyre very similar and you can start with either of them i believe 3 to four weeks is enough to learn the essence of just and automated testing principles next on our list is meta frameworks a meta framework is a higher level framework that sits on top of a core ui library or framework and enhances its capabilities its not something that all employers are looking for because its only used in newer projects a lot of older projects dont use a meta framework but if you want to have a competitive edge if youre looking for a better position with a better salary i would recommend learning a meta framework for react applications we have nextjs which is the more popular option and remix i recommend learning nextjs which you can master in four to 6 weeks if you have a strong foundation in react now if you want to get into mobile development and further increase your job opportunities learn react native its a framework for building crossplatform mobile apps using react if you have a solid understanding of react 2 months is enough to get a good grasp of react native so that really sums up the essential skills you need to become a frontend developer if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below and i will do my best to answer you right here or in my future videos if you enjoyed this video please give it a like and subscribe for more useful content,534

planning to start a career as a programmer do you think this is wise comment question a lot of people are worried that ai is going to replace software engineers so is coding still worth learning in 2024 well depends who you ask if you ask certain folks the ones who always seem miserable and say everything is going to collapse they will say no coding has no future but ive got a different take backed up by real world numbers in this video im sharing data that shows the continued demand for software engineers so to understand where we are now and what the future will look like for software engineers make sure to watch this video to the end first i want to be transparent ive been creating coding courses for the past 10 years and in that time ive been lucky enough to teach millions of people how to code and launch their careers in tech so yes you could say i have a vested interest in this field but i want to assure you that this isnt a sales pitch its about helping you make make an informed decision i want you to hear both side of the story and decide for yourself what you believe at the end of the day its your decision whether you want to learn coding or not and even if you want to you dont even have to buy my courses or learn from me there are thousands of great options out there so yeah there is a lot of fear about ai replacing coders headlines scream about robots taking over jobs and it can be overwhelming but the truth is ai is not going to take your job instead its the person who knows how to work with ai that will steal your job the reality is software engineering is not going away at least not anytime soon dont just take my word for it heres some data to back it up the united states bureau of labor statistics often called the bls is a government agency that tracks job growth across the country on their website you can see that the employment for software developers is expected to grow by 26 from 2022 to 2031 the average across all occupations is 3 so thats a strong indication that software engineering is here to stay but itll most likely transform and thats what well explore in this video to better understand the impact of ai on software engineering lets take a minute and talk about the history of programming in the early days of computing programmers wrote code in a way that only computers understood long strings of zeros and ones it was incredibly tedious they had to keep track of of exactly where each piece of data and code was stored in the computers memory and to do that they had to manually calculate memory addresses and make sure that different parts of the program didnt override each other compilers came to solve this problem with a compiler we can program in a human readable language like c without worrying about how that code should eventually get converted to zeros and ones and where it will get stored in the memory thats the job of a compiler now here heres a fact compilers didnt replace programmers they made them more efficient and the result of that the amazing websites and apps we have today that no one could even imagine in the past these days billions of people can communicate in real time ai will likely do the same in the future well be able to delegate routine and repetitive coding tasks to ai so we can focus on complex problem solving design and innovation this will allow us to build more sophisticated software that most people cant even imagine today but even then just because ai can generate code doesnt mean we can or we should delegate the entire coding aspect of software development to ai because ai generated code has a lower quality and humans still need to review and refine it before using it in production in fact theres a study to support this they collected 153 million change lines of code between january 2020 and december 2023 and they found disconcerting trends for maintenance ability and listen to their prediction for 2024 cod churn which means the percentage of lines that are reverted or updated less than 2 weeks after being authored is projected to double in 2024 so yes we can produce more code in less time with ai but more doesnt equal better humans should always review and refine ai generated code for quality and security before deploying it to production and that means all the coding skills as software engineer currently has will continue to stay relevant in the future you will still need the knowledge of data structures algorithms programming languages and their tricky parts tools and frameworks you still need to have all that knowledge to be able to review and refine the ai generated code youll just spend less time typing it so anyone telling you that you can use natural language to build software without understanding anything about coding is out of touch with the reality of software engineering sure you can make a dummy app but not the kind of software that runs our banks airlines healthcare the kind of software our life depends on we cant let a code monkey talk to a chat bot in plain english and get that software built at least not anytime soon in the future well probably spend more time designing new features and products with ai instead of writing boilerplate code well likely delegate aspects of coding to ai but this doesnt mean we dont need to learn to code think of it like a skilled architect using blue prints the architect doesnt need to handra the whole blueprint themselves but they still need to understand those blueprints in detail make sure everything works as designed and give clear instructions for those building the final structure as a software engineer youll always need to understand the code review what ai generates and refine it either by hand or by guiding the ai to improve also keep in mind that coding is only one part of a software engineers job we often spend most of our time talking to people understanding requirements writing stories discussing software architecture and so on ai cannot help with that aspect of our work it can only boost our programming productivity but not necessarily the overall productivity in fact another study by mckenzie found that for highly complex tasks developers saw less than a 10 improvement in their speed so as we can see here ai helped the most with documentation and code generation to some extent but moving on to refactoring the the improvement dropped to 20 and for highly complex tasks it was less than 10 and this happens when the coding task involves something the developer isnt already familiar with so if anyone tells you that software engineers will be obsolete in 5 years theyre either ignorant or trying to sell you something in fact some argue that the role of software engineers may become more valuable as they will be needed to develop manage and maintain these ai systems they need to understand all the complex of building software and use ai to boost their productivity now some are worried that one senior engineer can simply use ai and replace many engineers essentially leaving no job opportunities for juniors but again thats a fallacy because in reality the time savings you get from ai is not as great as you are promised anyone who has used ai to generate code knows that it takes effort to get the right prompts for usable results and the code still needs polishing so its not like like one engineer will suddenly have so much free time to do the job of many people now you might say but mos thats the current state of ai look ai is rapidly advancing and in a year or two it will be able to build software just like a human well in theory yes ai is advancing and one day it may even reach and surpass human intelligence but in theory theory and practice are the same in practice theyre not the reality is while machines may be able to handle repetitive and routine tasks human creativity and expertise will still be necessary for developing complex solutions and strategies i strongly believe software engineering is going to be extremely important over the next several decades i dont think its going away but i do think its going to change in the future well have to learn how to input the right prompt into our ai tools to get the expected result its not an easy skill to develop it requires problem solving capability as well as knowledge of languages and tools so heres the bottom line if you have already made up your mind and dont want to invest your time in software engineering thats perfectly fine follow your passion but if you like building things with code if the idea of shaping the future with technology gets you excited dont let negativity and fear hold your back software powers our world and that wont change anytime soon yes the tools will evolve but the true skill lies in learning and adapting the future software engineer needs todays coding skills and an understanding of how to use ai effectively the output of ai is only as good as the instructions you give it think about it programmers must work directly with zeros and once todays web developers need to know html css tailwind javascript typescript react nextjs git automated testing and so much more my prediction is that the future brings even more complexity demanding more knowledge and adaptability from software engineers if you found this video helpful

year even without a computer science degree meet my student john he used to work as an aviation electrician earning 28000 a year he dedicated 6 months to learn to code and landed his first developer job as a frontend developer boosting his salary to 552000 now hes a full stack developer earning 90000 a year john story is outstanding and quite frankly not everyone can get a job so quickly but ive seen tons of people people transform their careers through coding in a year this is francisco he was an electronics engineer he learned to code and landed his first developer job within a year now hes a software architect earning 2 and a half times more than his previous job so are you curious how they did it and if you can achieve the same results in this video im sharing a stepbystep system plus actionable tips to help you break into the world of coding even if you are starting from scratch all right the biggest mistake i see beginners make is that they try to learn a bunch of languages like python and javascript because somebody on youtube told them they are popular so they assume that simply learning a few popular languages automatically makes them hirable but it doesnt work that way these languages have specific purposes and are often used in different kinds of jobs some of these languages are also unrelated so learning all of them together doesnt really prepare you for any kind of job so instead of focusing on pro programming languages the first step is figuring out your dream take job do you want to build beautiful websites mobile apps games this decision will tell you what exactly you need to learn so you wouldnt waste time learning things that youre not going to use the next step is finding a learning path for the kind of work you want to do for example for web development you need to learn html css javascript and a bunch of other stuff now this applies to everything if game development gets you pumped thats a whole different set of tools so just do a simple search like game development learning path or data science learning path there are tons of road maps online the next step is learning and this is where ive seen a lot of people make common mistakes that slow them down the first mistake is that they go on youtube and watch random disconnected tutorials trying to learn bits and pieces it takes far longer to learn something properly this way the other common mistake i see is people go on platforms like udemy and take these super long courses thinking that more hours means they will learn more but in reality they often never finish up those courses and all those unfinished courses pile up and make them feel less motivated heres the right way to learn find a properly structured course you think you can commit to and finish theres so many excellent options out there pick an instructor whose teaching style you like and then dedicate yourself to actually finishing each course now simply watching videos is not enough coding is about solving new problems so you have to constantly practice and thats what i love love about coding thats what inspired me to become a software engineer and not a medical doctor or lawyer because i wasnt great at memorizing but with coding you dont need to memorize much you need analytical and problem solving skills and with practice you will naturally memorize the stuff you need to know now the best way to practice is asking chat gpt for exercise or project ideas just tell it what youre learning and your skill level and it can suggest some options if the suggestions are too complex just ask for simpler ones its a great way to find exercises and projects that will actually challenge you and help your progress now as you build projects make sure to put them on github github is like an online resume for developers you can put your code there and show it to potential employers plus you can get feedback from others in the community and improve your code there are also millions of projects on github so you can look at other peoples code and learn from them now lets talk about interviews a common mistake i see people make is not prepar ing for those coding interviews you can be a fantastic coder but interviews are their own beast especially at those top tech companies like google facebook and so on they often ask you tricky questions about data structures and algorithms like how to reverse a link list this is one of the topics taught to computer science students so if you dont have a computer science degree make sure to study this topic in reality you might never use these algorithms in your daytoday work but studying them helps you build your problem solving skill skills and stand out in interviews so along with all the things you have in your learning path make sure to take a course on data structures and algorithms to prepare for interviews a very useful website you can use to practice these interview questions is lead code you can filter questions by complexity or companies and so on its a very useful website also there are websites that offer mock interviews with experienced developers so you can do a mock interview and get feedback about your weak spots and where you got to improve pro all right once youre confident in your skills start applying for jobs but keep in mind you may apply for 100 jobs only here back from 10 to 20 and get five interviews its totally normal dont take it personally and definitely dont let it discourage you remember youre not the only one applying the key here is persistence keep applying for new jobs and also connect with recruiters on platforms like linkedin and twitter until you land your first job quite frankly landing the first job can be the hardest part but once you get your first job and have some real life experience under your belt finding those next opportunities becomes a whole lot easier now if you have any questions let me know in the comments below im here to help you and if you found this video

programming languages out there i totally get it its easy to get stuck jumping from one language to another and feeling like you are getting nowhere in this video im going to give you a road map so you can decide which languages are the best fit for your dream tech job and help you get there faster well explore different career paths and the languages that power them now before we get started i need to mention that some folks might be worried about about ai taking over software development jobs thats a whole other topic but let me just say this ai is going to be a powerful tool for developers not a replacement i cover this in detail in two other videos links are down below if youre curious also i need to tell you a fact simply learning a programming language isnt a golden ticket to a job right away so dont be fooled by youtube videos giving you such promises landing a tech job usually takes a combination of skills a programming language is one of them and its the first step in this video our focus is only on languages and nothing else now to decide what language to learn first you have to figure out what kind of tech career you want so what makes you excited do you like building amazing websites mobile apps games or software that controls physical objects what do you want to do lets talk about each of these paths and the languages they use lets start with web development if you dream of building beautiful websites or even online games this is the path for you now when web development has two main sites frontend and backend development frontend development is all about what the user sees and interacts with your key tools will be html css and javascript with html we can structure our web pages and their content with css we can make them pretty and with javascript we can make them dynamic so we can respond to user actions like clicks and drags and do cool things now backend development is the behindth scenes magic databases servers and the logic that makes everything work now here we have a few options we can use javascript python java php c and so on now as we can see if you learn javascript you can use it both for the front end and backend development so you dont need to learn one extra language for backend development and guess what if you can build both the front end and backend together youre essentially a full stack developer with a higher salary okay now lets talk about mobile development here we have two main paths native and crossplatform development native development means we build apps specifically for either android or ios for android java is a classic choice but cotlin is becoming the modern favorite for ios your goto language will be swift but objective c is still used for older projects now crossplatform development lets you use a single code base to create apps for both android and ios saving time and resources here we have two popular choices for building mobile apps react native and flutter these are not programming languages they tools or frameworks they allow you to build user interfaces and access things like the camera gps or motion sensors now depending on your location there might be slightly more job opportunities for one or the other so jump on popular job searching websites and do a bit of research on the job market now if you want to use flutter you have to learn dart if you want to use react native you have to learn javascript so as you can see if you learn javascript you can use it for frontend development backend development and mobile development giving you plenty of opportunities now lets talk about game development to build games we have to use a game engine we have two popular game engines which are unity and unreal engine unity is a bit more beginner friendly and is often used in small to mediumsized game studios onreal engine is a bit more advanced and is used in large scale games that are visually stunning for unity you have to learn c for unreal engine you have to learn c all right now lets talk about embedded systems this field is all about building software that can control real world objects like smart watches selfdriving cars medical robots appliances and so on here we have a few choices c and c which are the tried and true languages for embedded systems they let you talk directly to the hardware for max maimum control but you can also learn rust which is a newer language that is all about safety and speed its perfect for making sure your smart devices work perfectly without errors again before deciding which language to learn first do a bit of research and find out which language offers more job opportunities in your location all right the last career path were going to talk about is ai and machine learning a field that is rapidly shaping how we interact with technology if thats something youre excited about high is the goto language for data science and machine learning we also have r which is popular for statistical computing and creating beautiful data visualizations now im super curious which language do you want to learn after this video let me know in the comments below and remember im here to help so if i missed anything or if you have any questions dont hesitate to ask let me know in the comments so i can create more helpful content for you and finally if you found this video helpful give it a like
