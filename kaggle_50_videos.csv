Ph6diqjuJAY,KaggleX Final Project Presentation with Favour Aghaebe,"About the project: As someone with aging parents, I’ve become increasingly concerned about the prevalence of misinformation—spread through both the internet and social circles—regarding nutrition. Nutritional fads, ranging from extreme diets to ""miracle foods,"" often cause more harm than good, especially for aging individuals. To address this, I aim to create a fuss-free bot that provides personalized, evidence-based nutrition advice. My goal is to help caregivers and individuals make informed decisions about what a healthy diet looks like for them, ultimately promoting a balanced lifestyle free from confusion and the risks posed by misinformation. By offering clear, practical, and tailored guidance based on each person's unique needs and preferences, the bot will empower users to navigate the complexities of nutrition with confidence and improve their overall well-being. 

About Favour Aghaebe: A data science professional and PhD candidate at the University of Sheffield, specializes in health data analytics, driving impactful projects to improve health outcomes and inform policy.

LStBSjDz7bc,KaggleX Final Project Presentation with Rukayat Adedeji,"About the project: This drug interaction chatbot aims to provide patients with an AI assistant they can consult when considering new over-the-counter medications, ensuring these will not negatively interact with their current chronic condition treatments. I successfully used the LoRA technique to fine-tune the Gemma2 model with over 2,000 conversational data points.  Due to the nature of this chatbot and the need for reliable resposes, I also implemented RAG to fetch external resources to help the model in its response. The fine-tuned model is quite accurate in identifying drug interactions from medication lists. It is able to relay this information in a clear and conversational tone, which was the goal.

About Rukayat Adedeji: A pharmacist and data scientist, leverages AI to revolutionize healthcare with a focus on personalized medicine, patient accessibility, and innovative solutions like AI-driven cancer treatment and a drug interaction chatbot.
