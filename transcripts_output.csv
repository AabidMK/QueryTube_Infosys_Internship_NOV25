A6hzHov7Kng,"So, I'd like to begin with a story. When
my daughter was a baby, we lived in New
York City and I was there studying to
get a PhD in social and organizational
psychology. And I was researching
conflict resolution and negotiation.
And like most New Yorkers, we would walk
everywhere. And I would push her in a
stroller with two hands like a
responsible parent all over the city.
But I noticed that my husband, he pushed
the stroller quite differently with one
hand kind of off to the side and kind of
looking a little bit too cool, like he
had better places to be.
And this really bothered me. I started
to get angry and um I started to make
all these causal attributions, what
psychologists call these explanations
for his behavior.
One I thought maybe, oh, he's a hot shot
Wall Street lawyer now. He thinks he's
too good to push a stroller. Or I
thought m maybe he thinks women are the
only ones who should push strollers. Or
maybe he didn't care about safety and
and that was why he was doing it that
way. So as I was thinking about all
these explanations for his behavior, I
started to get angry and that anger
started to build up and I vented. I
expressed my anger forcefully to anybody
who would listen, called my friends,
called my sister. But that venting
didn't help release my anger. I actually
felt even angrier until one day I saw my
dad pushing the stroller the exact same
way. He came into the city and he was
taking my daughter to the park and he's
walking like that and I know my dad
doesn't care about looking cool. Sorry,
Dad. Um,
and uh I said, ""I know I must be missing
something here. What don't I know about
this situation?"" So, I asked him a
simple question. I said, ""Dad, why are
you pushing the stroller like this?"" And
he said, ""Oh, well, because when I use
two hands, my stride is too long and I
kick the bottom of the stroller and it
hurts. that actually cuts into my shins.
He's like, ""So I much prefer it, but
that's why I do it.""
And so what I realized at the time, I
was learning all about this cognitive
bias, but I made the fundamental
attribution error. This is when you
overattribute
the causes for someone's behavior to
something internal to them, something
internal and controllable rather than to
some external cause. So you
underemphasize the external or
situational causes that might be really
the explanations for someone's behavior.
So at that moment I started to get
really curious about venting because I
thought that was helping me in some way.
But so as a researcher and getting my
PhD I started to look into venting a
little bit more and I found out that
actually venting doesn't release anger.
And many years of research showed that.
And I thought, well, this is really
important because we have anger all
around us all the time. If you think
about road rage or trolls on the
internet or divisive politics or wars,
anger is everywhere. And maybe we're not
really knowing how we should manage
that.
So my research early in my career asked
that some really critical questions. So
I thought one is if venting doesn't work
why not and if venting doesn't work why
do we keep doing it? Okay so hold on to
those questions for a minute um because
I want to back up and talk a little bit
about anger first.
So
um cognitive appraisal theorists
talk about anger as not something that
happens to us but rather something that
we construct in our brain when we assign
explanations to some event. So when I
was pushing the stroller and I saw my
husband pushing it in this kind of odd
way. I started to build these
explanations, as I said, these internal
controllable causes for his behavior
and those causal attributions
led to my anger. Okay? And they also say
that anger and attributions have this
recursive process. It's a
self-reinforcing process where the more
I hold someone responsible for some
action, the angrier I am. And the
angrier I get, the more I hold that
person responsible. So it becomes
self-reinforcing cycle.
Now there's something else that happens
with anger too. Anger has action
tendencies.
So it pushes us to act to do something.
It readies us for some action. And
that's important because what I did was
I vented as the action. My took my anger
and I vented. But it didn't decrease my
anger.
So, let me make this a little bit more
personal for just a moment. And I want
you to think about your own experience
with anger. If you can take a moment
right now and recall a time where you
felt angry at someone, it could be maybe
someone at work, maybe in traffic, maybe
politics.
Think about what you're angry about. And
now think about those causal
attributions, those explanations that
you have for why this is happening. Why
did this angerprovoking event occur? So
just take one pause and think about
that.
Did you make internal controllable
attributions? So maybe you got cut off
in traffic. Did you say, ""Oh, that
person's so inconsiderate, something
about them that they had control over.""
Or maybe someone did something else and
you said, ""Oh, they're so selfish."" Or
if you're thinking about maybe some
particular politicians, oh, they're such
a narcissist or they're incompetent.
Maybe you thought that. Maybe, however,
you made some external attributions. So
maybe you said something like, ""Well,
they were late because of the snowstorm,
something that they're not in control
over, or they had a family emergency.""
If you make external attributions, you
tend not to get angry or less so you may
actually feel some empathy or sadness.
And if you blame yourself for a negative
behavior or or a negative event, you
might feel shame. So every attribution
kind of relates to particular emotions.
Now, how many of you after this event,
this anger that I asked you just to
recall a moment ago, how many of you
actually vented? Maybe sh show of hands
some of you. Yeah. Okay. So, some people
vent as a way to deal with their anger
like I did. You would be in very good
company because Freud, Sigman Freud,
advocated venting as a way to manage
your anger. He actually talked about
something called the hydraulic model.
So, the hydraulic model, he compared
anger inside an individual to steam
inside a hot pipe. And if you didn't
vent the steam from the pipe, the pipe
would explode. And similarly he said if
people don't somehow release their anger
through venting verbally um they would
then act out they would become
aggressive.
So um this metaphor be was very
compelling. It stuck right? People
believed in it and they kept doing it.
However, as I said just a little moment
ago, most of the research on venting
shows that it doesn't work.
So let's get to my research and those
two questions that I said at the
beginning. One, if venting doesn't work,
why not? And if venting doesn't work,
why do we keep doing it? So
my first research with my co-authors, we
looked at venting verbally, which means
expressing your anger forcefully, to
someone else. And we we looked at the
different targets. So, we looked at
either a friend, a third party, somebody
who's not involved in the conflict, or
the offender, the the offender, the
person involved in whatever conflict or
anger-provoking incident you I asked we
asked participants to recall. We also
had a control group where they they just
recalled the anger, they didn't actually
vent. And we wanted to see what happened
um and to see kind of the process that
first question, why isn't the venting
working? And we found that when people
vented to a friend, to a third party,
they vented with more internal
controllable attributions. And those
internal controllable attributions led
to that anger. And that's that
self-reinforcing cycle that I just
talked about a moment ago. When they
vented to the offender, interestingly,
they used fewer internal controllable
attributions and they actually felt less
angry. So, we realized, we concluded the
answer to why verbal venting doesn't
work is because you're not changing
those attributions. You're just
rehearsing those attributions that led
to your anger in the first place. Okay,
so answered question one,
but that didn't answer question two,
which is why do we keep doing it if it's
not releasing our anger? So,
what we did next was verb venting
doesn't happen in a vacuum, right?
There's usually somebody responding to
us. So we said let's look at responses
now. And we asked the third party that
friend to give some responses to the the
person venting. They either reinforced
the the the the
interpretation. So those explanations,
those internal controllable
attributions, they would say something
like, ""Yeah, you're right to be angry.
They are really selfish."" That would be
reinforcing. Or we ask them to
reinterpret. Well, have you thought
about some other possible causes for
this? maybe something external.
In both cases, the anger didn't change.
They were they remained angry no matter
what the response was. However, we did
measure a separate emotion, something
that looked at overall well-being. We
called it emotional tone and we found
that emotional tone did change
significantly after getting a response
from the other party. And this is what
we thought and we concluded that this is
why people keep venting is because
venting is not just an emotional
process. Venting is also a social and
relational process. So we felt better.
We felt heard. We felt less alone. So we
vented. Okay? And so that's the answer
to the second question. Why do we keep
doing it? Because we might not be
impacting our anger, but we are feeling
better overall.
That's not the whole story.
One more thing. So when I asked you
before, some people raised their hand
about venting. Maybe some people do
other things when they get angry. Maybe
you go for a really like long run. Some
people said yes. Yeah. Sometimes you go
to the gym, maybe work out. Um maybe you
scream into a pillow. Um
well, bad news, that doesn't help
either.
So research by um uh researchers at Ohio
State University did a very recent 2024
meta analysis where they looked at 40
years of venting research and they found
that physiologically arousing activities
do not decrease anger.
Verbal venting being one of those
physiologically arousing activities, it
raises your heart rate, it raises your
blood pressure. That does not reduce
anger. What does reduce anger across
these 40 years of studies they found is
actually activities that reduce your
physiological arousal. Things like
meditation, deep breathing, yoga.
So what I'm saying here is really I want
to say one thing really important. Anger
isn't bad.
Anger is actually a motivator to do
something, right? It has that action
tendency and anger can get you out of a
bad relationship. It can motivate you to
leave a job when you have a toxic boss.
It can allow you to stand up when you
think that there's an injustice. It can
have you fight for rights, right? So
anger is a really useful emotion.
However, we have to know how to regulate
it. Otherwise, we won't be using it. It
will be using us. So we have to think
about better ways to regulate our anger.
Venting isn't doing it. Okay. So
this TED conference today is about
building bridges. And when I vented
about my husband with the weird stroller
pushing that he did,
I wasn't building a bridge between us. I
was actually making more distance
between us. But what does and could
build bridges are things that come out
of this research that I've talked about
today. Here are four things you can do
if you're looking to regulate your anger
and then use it to direct it in in the
appropriate ways.
Engage in low arousal activities.
Um check those causal attributions.
Right? So Freud talked about venting the
steam. It's not about that. It's what's
going through the pipe. Think about
those attributions you're making. Be
more conscious of that. Remember, you
might want to gather some new
information. What don't you know? Ask
yourself that question. And then also be
very deliberate about your actions.
Consider what actions you're going to
take. As I said, anger can be a useful
emotion. You just want to be in charge
of the actions you take.
And finally, to wrap up, you might be
wondering what my husband's up to these
days. Well, he's no longer a Wall Street
lawyer. And um he actually is taking up
yoga and he does it uh usually right
before dinner when the dishes, you know,
need to be put on the table and maybe
might want to unload the dishwasher. Um
and if I didn't know my research, I
might say he's being really selfish.
she's trying to get out of um
responsibilities. And I might vent. I
might call my sister and vent about it,
but I don't. What I do instead is I ask,
""What don't I know?"" I do a little more
digging. And you know, my daughter who
was in the stroller so many years ago,
well, she lives in London now. She's a
huge fan of yoga and he's practicing a
lot because she's invited him to a yoga
retreat that they can do together when
they see each other next month. So if
you're um if you feel yourself that
little spark of anger,
don't vent. Check those attributions and
do a little yoga.
Thank",,
ueaAdCKDCH0,"So Sean, what are we going to make here?
>> Um, well, we just have a bunch of stuff
that's very seasonal. So, we gathered a
whole bunch of ingredients that are out
right now, right around us.
>> We're going to cook a little bit of a
bison steak that's been marinated with
some sumac and some maple sugar and some
chili. And we're going to use some true
handh harvested rice that's here from
Minnesota.
Cities like New York or Chicago or LA,
like you can find food from all over the
world, but can you really find food from
the land that you're standing on? And
it's so rare, you know. So, we want to
normalize that because we want the next
generation of especially indigenous kids
when they're out and about and trying to
decide what they want for dinner. Do
they want pizza? Do they want Chinese?
Do they want Native American? Like, we
just want to be on that list, bro.
>> The fact that there aren't Native
American restaurants and the fact that
there is not a lot of knowledge of
indigenous cuisine, it's not accidental.
>> Absolutely. I mean, the eraser of
indigenous peoples in the Americas has
been something that's been ongoing for
quite a while. The philosophy was
basically in order to showcase what our
indigenous foods to North America, we
took away colonial ingredients. So we
removed things like dairy, wheat flour,
cane sugar, beef, pork, chicken, and
just really focused on what was here
first and built entire menus around
that. So I just take a little piece of
the steak um and get try to get a little
bit of all the pieces, even a little bit
of the leaf in there. Just try to get
all of those things mingling together
just to like experience like all that
flavor all at once.
M.
That is so good.
>> It's really clean, right? And it just
tastes like where we are right now at
this moment. And these flavors have been
utilized for so",,
CfPFU4UaaRA,"What do you think of
when you see this forest?
Maybe you think of ways
the forest could be useful to us.
Maybe as a source
of timber or a fuel wood,
or maybe as a store of carbon
with which we can tackle climate change.
And all of these are useful
and sometimes necessary ways of thinking
about a forest or any ecosystem.
Or maybe, just maybe, you feel
something more mysterious and wondrous.
Maybe you have an inkling of a world
far more ancient than our young species.
A world full of beings
that communicate in languages
of sound and chemistry and light,
that we barely understand.
A world that needs
to be approached with humility.
In this world,
plants perform the everyday miracle
of turning light and air into life,
and that energy that captured sunshine
then cascades from plant to animal
to fungus to bacterium.
And on the way,
it carries great currents of carbon,
nitrogen and other essential nutrients
that together build the web of life
that is that ecosystem.
And the same applies
at the scale of the planet.
The planet is the sum
of the world's ecosystems,
but it is so much more.
It is an interconnected and shimmering web
of flows of carbon
and energy and nutrients
that build up the ancient matrix
that is our home,
from which we have emerged
as a species that nurtures us,
on which we depend utterly.
I'm an ecosystem ecologist,
and I study this world
of flows and interactions.
And together with a team
of ecologists around the world,
we measure and map the flows of energy,
of carbon and nutrients
that build up the ecosystem.
Starting with the capture
of sunshine by plants,
we follow those flows of energy
to build the biomass of trees,
and we follow that energy down
into the roots and fungi
and into the soil,
and then beyond the plants and fungi,
into the creatures of the soil,
the worms, the invertebrates,
by measuring the abundance
of each creature,
we can map and calculate
these flows of energy.
And we find every life form
a miracle of evolution.
Sometimes our approaches
take the latest technologies,
such as acoustic sensors or camera traps,
coupled with artificial
intelligence tools.
Sometimes we use more
traditional approaches,
such as counting birds
in a rainforest at dawn,
that require training
and expertise and dedication and passion.
And with this type of work,
we're able to build up a map
of the flows that make up an ecosystem.
So to take an example
of this English woodland
just outside of Oxford,
we can calculate that 60 percent
of that captured sunshine
pours down into the trunks of the trees.
A smaller fraction
pours down from the trees
through the roots into the soil.
Another pathway into the soil
is falling leaves in the autumn,
or falling fruit.
Of all that plant material,
a fraction is consumed
by plant-eating animals,
and a smaller fraction of that is consumed
by animal-eating animals,
and so the web of life
is built and maintained.
And by doing this work
in various ecosystems,
we learn some things.
One thing we learn is that the resilience
and health of an ecosystem
is determined both by the total
amount of flow of energy,
but also by how complex
that flow of energy is,
how many species it passes through.
And I call this complex flow
of energy the spread of energy,
the vibrancy of an ecosystem.
In our current work,
we're also trying to go
from individual ecosystems
to the scale of the whole living planet,
the biosphere.
Here's one example which we seek
to look at the biosphere
through these biological eyes.
And this is a map of the intensity
of biological activity
on the land surface.
And this is for July,
and the world looks vaguely familiar.
Africa looks a bit strange,
the Sahara has shriveled away to nothing,
the southern hemispheres have shrunk away.
This is January and look
how different the world is.
The Northern hemisphere has shriveled away
into its deep, dark winter.
The world is dominated by the magnificent
metabolism of the tropics.
We live on a tropical planet.
Just look how large Kenya is there
compared to all of Europe biologically.
And we can do this
for every month of the year.
And so get a glimpse of the great
green heartbeat of energy and life
that powers and nourishes
all life on this planet Earth.
(Applause)
And through this work,
I can tell you some
really interesting science.
And I'm here to tell you
some of those scientific stories,
but I'm here to do more than that.
I also want to argue
that this vibrancy of the living world
is something that we don't
pay enough attention to
when we think of how
we work with nature
to tackle the environmental
challenges we face.
In conservation,
we may focus excessively on particular
charismatic species like elephants,
or we may focus instead
on what nature can do for us,
its ecosystem services.
And we don't pay enough attention
to the webs of energy and life
that hold everything together.
So when we look at the world
through these vibrancy eyes,
some surprises can emerge.
Vibrant ecosystems don't
have to be places empty of people.
Many cultures, traditional cultures,
Indigenous people, smallholder farmers,
live in places fizzing
with ecological energy.
And many agricultural systems,
regenerative systems and others,
can also buzz with ecological energy.
The absence of people is not
the highest state of nature.
We need it in some places perhaps,
but in many places people
can and do build vibrant nature
and we need to work with those energies.
We have also learned
what is not a vibrant ecosystem.
Images such as this,
endless rows of trees,
perhaps planted for timber
or for carbon capture,
the richness of life
reduced to a single function.
All that vibrant flow of energy channeled
and canalized into a single species.
This is not a forest.
And yet, when we think of working
with nature to tackle climate change,
we're in danger sometimes of focusing
too much on the carbon value of nature.
And carbon has a role.
Certainly, there are situations where
it can help us mitigate climate change
and at the same time raise
finance that can help us protect
or restore natural ecosystems.
But if we go too far,
if we focus on carbon,
when we stop it being a tool
and it starts becoming a worldview,
then we're in danger of reducing
the infinities of nature
into some sort of carbon machine
that we can dial up and down.
Here's another example of this.
This is a landscape,
and you may look at this
and see all of those open,
treeless spaces and think,
well, maybe this is an opportunity
for tree planting.
Trees are inherently good
and they absorb carbon,
and maybe you can offset
your company's carbon emissions
with an extensive tree
planting program here.
But this is a savannah.
And the savannah is rich precisely
because of the lack of trees.
It's those grasses that grow in the open
spaces that provide, nourish life,
provide for life-regenerating fires,
and support the unique and charismatic
biodiversity that is the savannah.
This should not be a focus
for intensive tree planting
for carbon capture and climate mitigation.
We need to work with
vibrancy of the Earth.
But why does vibrancy matter?
For many reasons.
But I think one of the reasons
is that it gives ecosystems
and all of us who depend on ecosystems,
our best chance to adapt
and cope with aspects of the tide
of global change that is engulfing us,
including from climate change.
And I'd like to show one final example,
which is the case of tropical atolls.
Atolls are low-lying islands,
less than one meter above sea level,
and are often characterized
as the first victims of climate change
destined to drown under the rising seas
in the next few decades.
Or are they?
We've just finished a project
where we've examined these island systems,
but rather than seeing them
as islands in isolation,
we've looked at them as integrated
and interconnected island reef systems.
And when we look at it that way,
that view makes all the difference.
So what we did is compare
wild islands with ghost islands.
And wild islands are places such as this,
where seabirds come in to nest on the soil
or in the branches of a native vegetation.
And ghost islands are places such as this.
Now this may look like your
archetypal holiday paradise
of swaying palm trees
and white sand and turquoise waters,
but this is an ecologically
depleted system,
its vibrancy is dimmed.
Why is that, I hear some of you ask.
It's because many of these places
were once coconut plantations
for an extensive coconut oil
industry on these islands,
which has now largely collapsed,
these plantations are abandoned.
But the coconut is overgrowing
and suppressing the return
of native vegetation.
And also many of these islands
are densely populated by rats
brought in by sailors,
which eat out the eggs of seabirds
and prevent the seabirds from nesting.
So in this project,
we followed the flow
of energy and nutrients
from the seabirds
through into the forest
and then beyond the forest,
into the surrounding reef.
And what we found
is that on the wild islands,
the seabirds harvested fish
for hundreds of kilometers
and brought in the nutrients
in those fish to the islands
where they deposited
those nutrients in their poop,
their guano, that fertilized the island.
The poop and the guano
then washed off into the surrounding reef
and increased the rate
of growth of the coral,
and also the rate at which
the coral bounced back
from bleaching events
linked to heat waves.
And those higher nutrients also
supported a higher abundance of fish.
And of particular importance
are the parrotfish,
which with their beaks,
they eat away at the dead coral
to get at the algae inside,
and in the process,
they poop out the coral as sand
and that parrotfish poop, that sand,
then washes up to create the island.
And what we found
is that about up to 85 percent
of the sand on these islands
originated as parrotfish poop.
If you're lucky enough
to find yourself on a sandy, white,
tropical island beach,
think about the parrotfish
and be grateful.
(Laughter)
But we also found the native vegetation
doing extraordinary things
that, in just one square meter of soil,
the plants produced
20 kilometers of fine roots,
and those roots bound the sand together
and can turn that sand
into nourishing soil.
And so the forest was able to grow
and the island to grow alongside it.
So what we were able to do in this project
is describe this flow of energy
and sediment and nutrients
from birds to island to reef
and then back to islands.
And when we put all our numbers together,
we calculated that a wild island,
a vibrant island,
full of seabirds, of native vegetation
and fish that aren't overharvested,
those islands were able to grow
at rates that keep up with mid-level
scenarios of sea-level rise.
But a depleted island,
diminished in its vibrancy,
would struggle much more
and is much more likely to drown
under the rising tides.
But there are limits to this adaptation.
The extreme levels of sea level rise
would be hard to cope with,
so we shouldn't use signs of adaptation
as an excuse to not tackle the urgency
of tackling climate change
and sea-level rise.
So the lesson that comes from this project
is that we need to work with the vibrancy
of these atoll systems
to maintain and restore
that vibrancy where we can,
to give them their best chance
of coping with climate change
and for the communities
that depend on them
also to have the best chance
of coping with rising sea level.
And I think there's a wider principle
that's being emerged here.
It's just harder to see
in most ecosystems,
which are much more spatially
entangled and much more complex,
like this rainforest here in the Amazon,
where it's really hard
to predict the details
of how ecosystems are going to respond
to the tide of global change
that is engulfing them,
whether from climate change
or from the other factors.
What we do know is that the more
we can work with the wild energies
of these ecosystems,
the more we can maintain
and rebuild their vibrancy,
the best chance they have to cope
with the change that is coming
and adapt to that change,
and the best chance we have,
as all who are dependent
on these ecosystems,
to adapt to that change.
And that applies to wild
and semi-wild ecosystems,
but I believe it also
applies to our agricultural systems
and our urban landscapes as well.
And this applies at the scale
of the planet, the living Earth.
We need to work with
the energies of the biosphere
to regenerate and restore them,
to have a world that is vibrant
and as possible,
not a biosphere that is
commodified and packaged
and industrialized
to be subservient to human needs,
but are resilient and regenerative planet
where both humans
and the rest of life on Earth
can thrive and flourish.
Thank you.

we're finding the best of the best ideas
all over the world and choosing one
person from each city to take the main
TED stage in Vancouver. Now, listen, I'm
doing everything in my power to not turn
this into a food vlog, but Singapore is
really testing me. The TEDex team kept
my stomach extremely full, and this
honestly could have been a mukbang. But
the real highlight wasn't the food, it
was the people. The speakers took the

incredible. They're real doers creating
change. From reef restoration to
redefining caregiving to shifting
perspectives through cycling, every idea
came from lived work. In Singapore,
wildly different ideas shared the same

Finish pumpkin bass cheesecake with a
ginger snap crumble. Um, more pumpkin
seed oil.
>> I need that.
>> This is an interesting one. I've heard
of and known about the TED conference
for a long time and you know getting to
know more about this dining program and
and how few restaurants they go to. It
was it was pretty cool feeling that they
would choose to come here see what we're
doing at AV.
>> Food isn't just about what's on the
plate. It's about the ideas and culture
that bring it to life.",,
p0IpMqUZKbs,"When I moved to Los Angeles, I was at
the grocery store buying a lemon when my
neighbor saw me and he said, ""Why are
you buying a lemon?"" There is a giant
lemon tree on the street in front of
both of our homes. Now, until he said
that, I had never really thought about
where food comes from. In fact, if you'd
asked me, ""Where does food come from?"" I
would have said the supermarket. But of
course, that's not true, right? Like
food is grown. It comes from nature. And
no one has changed the way that I think
about the world around me and the food
that comes from it more than today's
guest, Chef Shawn Sherman. So today,
we're in Minneapolis, Minnesota to talk
to Shawn about where food comes from,
how it is cultivated, how it's grown,
how it's served, and what that means for
the culture and history of the place
that we're in.
Sean Sherman is an Oglala Lakota chef
who opened his restaurant Awami in 2021.
The restaurant overlooks the Mississippi
River where there used to be a huge
waterfall. And in fact, Sean tells me
that Oamni is short for Oamni Yamni,
place of the falling swirling water. And
the food here, well, there is a reason
why this place is almost always fully
booked.
>> You started this restaurant and it's won
a bunch of awards. It's It's gotten a
bunch of acclaim. What makes this
different than other restaurants in the
Twin Cities?
>> The philosophy was basically in order to
showcase what are indigenous foods to
North America, we took away colonial
ingredients. So we removed things like
dairy, wheat flour, cane sugar, beef,
pork, chicken, and just really focused
on what was here first and built entire
menus around that. On top of that, just
featuring indigenous products from
indigenous producers first because we
want to make sure our food dollars are
intentionally going to who we want to
support. So it's just a unique and
different restaurant.
>> I've heard you sometimes refer to the
food that you serve as ironically
foreign,
>> right? It's true. I mean because the
western diets kind of ignored so much of
what is just this amazing bounty of what
is in North America and indigenous diets
are really focused on a lot of that
plant diversity and we really highlight
and showcase a lot of that in our menus
today. So it's foreign because it's
foreign to many people who haven't grown
up eating it.
>> Absolutely. And because our western
diets are really obviously
industrialized and you know it's a part
of the you know just what's in the
grocery store. That's where food comes
from. But, you know, from an indigenous
perspective, when you look outside,
there's just food all around us
constantly if you know what to look for.
>> When Shawn says there's food all around
us, he really means it because right
outside of there's a public park filled
with plants native to the area.
>> How many plants do you want me to talk
about? Cuz I can do this all day.
>> Hi, I'm Linda Black Elk and I'm an
ethnobbotonist.
>> For people who aren't familiar, what is
an ethnobbotonist? An ethnobbatonist is
someone who teaches about the
relationship between people and plants.
>> Linda Black Elk works with Shawn at the
organization North American Traditional
Indigenous Food Systems, which helps
create access to indigenous foods and
education. And today, I'm going foraging
with her right here in this park, smack
in the middle of a busy city.
So this is an incredible plant and you
can tell that it's a resilient plant
because this particular one is growing
out of this stone wall. Um this is yo if
you can tell by the scientific name
Achilia nilofolium. Who's it named
after?
>> Achilles.
>> Exactly. And that's because
>> easy question. It's actually mentioned
in the Iliad. Um even Achilles used this
plant to treat the wounds of the
soldiers who were fighting alongside
him. And in fact it is an important
medicinal plant all over the world on
almost every populated continent. Uh the
Dakota refer to this plant as topi
pesuta which means wound medicine. I
love the Ojiway name which I think is a
lot more um sort of poetic maybe. So if
you look at this leaf the Ojiway name
ajituizo means squirrel tail.
>> Oh.
>> And so it looks like a bushy little
squirrel's tail.
>> That's so fun. bushy little squirrel
tail.
>> So, this is juniper. And we use these
beautiful little blueberries, which are
actually cones botanically um in all
kinds of dishes. They're really yummy
and medicinal.
>> Oh, yeah. That's that classic juniper
smell.
>> Strong flavor. Yeah, absolutely.
>> Wait, no, just kidding.
>> Oh, wow. I wouldn't I say that'd be a
great prank if you're like this
interview's over.
>> So, the next plant that I wanted to show
you is pineapple weed. And um this is
basically our native chamomile. It is
fantastic. Here, take this, crush it,
and smell it.
>> Ooh.
>> Isn't that fantastic?
>> Smells like pineapple.
>> It does. And so, you can make a
beautiful tea out of this that is
relaxing. Um, it will help you sleep,
although it's very gentle.
>> One of the things that I love about the
plants in the chamomile family is that
you see them like growing between the
cracks in the concrete. They really are
everywhere.
>> I always say that I walk on the land
differently than a lot of people because
I never really feel alone. So, even if
there aren't other people around, um, I
have my plant friends and relatives and
allies there with me.
Now, I I've heard you say that sometimes
you hesitate to tell people about which
plants are edible because there's this
tendency to then like grab all of it, to
take it all and to not leave in a
sustainable way.
>> We do find that some people get a little
overzealous. So, we always make sure to
talk about sustainability and how we can
be respectful to the plant nations. Um,
and so that requires us to harvest it by
maybe not taking too much. I think
something that's so important for people
to know is that native people weren't
even allowed to harvest their plants
until like within my lifetime. In 1978,
the American Indian Religious Freedom
Act was enacted and that finally allowed
native people to harvest their
traditional foods and medicines. Before
that, it was literally illegal. And so
um for non-native people to come onto
native lands, extract knowledge and then
take that back with them without that
context, without that knowledge, um you
know, is is is very frowned upon. So
instead, we try to teach about
relationship history. Getting people to
stop and only harvest plants with
intention and respect by helping them
understand what's edible, what's not
edible, what's medicinal, and not. um
they will look at the world around them
in a different way.
>> You know, one thing that foraging with
Linda has made me realize is that I had
never tasted some of these flavors
before.
>> It has a a real bitterness at the end.
>> It does.
>> My palette was used to something very
different. And it's strange to realize
that these flavors were always here all
along.
Flavors that I am lucky to be learning
about right now and to learn about even
more in Sean's kitchen.
>> So Sean, what are we going to make here?
Um, well, we just have a bunch of stuff
that's very seasonal. So, we gathered a
whole bunch of ingredients that are out
right now, right around us. We're going
to cook a little bit of a bison steak
that's been marinated with some sumac
and some maple sugar and some chili. And
we're going to use some true handh
harvested rice that's here from
Minnesota. This stuff's all, you know,
harvested on canoes and it's just really
cool stuff.
>> Amazing. Can you walk me through what we
have up here?
>> Yeah, I have no idea. I just found all
the stuff on the sidewalk.
>> That's how it goes mostly, too.
So, um, yeah, we have a bunch of
different things cuz we have some
bergamont, some hisop, some plantains,
some fresh junberries cuz we have a
couple of those trees out there. This is
the wild rice we're going to be cooking.
Um, some fresh nettles, and these are
stinging nettles. You have to be careful
with them. Uh, the milkweed flowers,
fireweed, and we're just going to keep
going from there.
>> And this bison comes from a a local
provider or where
>> So, we get this bison um from Cheyenne
River Sue Tribe out of South Dakota. Um,
so they're just a Lakota tribe right in
the very center of the state, right
along the Missouri River Valley. Um, and
yeah, so we just try to support
indigenous producers. We try to utilize
obviously a lot of wild flavors. Um, and
it's just a lot of plant diversity on
one plate.
>> The fact that there aren't Native
American restaurants and the fact that
there is not a lot of knowledge of
indigenous cuisine, it's not accidental.
No,
>> it was a very conscious program to try
and erase indigenous history, to try and
erase Native American culture.
>> Yeah, absolutely. I mean, the eraser of
indigenous peoples in the Americas has
been something that's been ongoing for
quite a while. And growing up Lakota on
Pine Ridge, like, you know, it's only a
couple generations ago, cuz my
greatgrandfather, for example, was at
Battle of Little Bigghorn when he was
18. And like my grandparents were the
first generation of kids to have to go
through assimilation processes through
boarding schools to cut their hair, to
learn English, to learn Christianity,
and to basically be stripped of culture
completely, you know. So, a lot of those
pieces are a part of the story of why we
don't see Native American restaurants
everywhere.
And so, I just have a little bit of
seasoned oil. This is with a little bit
of sumac inside of it.
>> Um, and we're just going to heat that up
a moment. We're trying to imagine what
does this look like for the future
generations, you know, because I'm just
trying to change what I grew up with,
which growing up on Pine Ridge
Reservation, like we didn't have a lot
of nutritional access. We didn't have a
lot of food access in general. So, we
had one grocery store that serviced an
area the size of Connecticut. So, I just
want to change the way that access
happens cuz there's no reason why we
shouldn't have healthy and culturally
relevant foods in places like where I
grew up on Pine Ridge Reservation and
elsewhere. And then I'm just going to
pop this rice in. Just let it heat up a
little bit.
It's already going to have a lot of
flavor, but I'm just going to add a
couple of leaves of this bergamont cuz
this is kind of like almost like a wild
oregano flavorish.
>> Can I take a bite of that?
>> Uhhuh.
>> Oh, wow. That is such a beautiful
flavor.
>> And this is going to taste like where we
are in time right now, which is
basically, you know, kind of early
summer still.
>> I mean, you can't smell this, but it
smells so good.
>> Yeah. And then um we're just going to
kill that for now. That's pretty much
that piece.
Oops. Right behind.
All right, we're just going to let these
rest for a moment. Then we're going to
plate up.
>> And what's this sauce?
>> This is just a basic wo japi, which is
just a basic mixed berry sauce. And it
kind of came from the choked cherry
sauce that we used to make when I was a
kid on Pine Ridge out of just choked
cherries and water.
Wow, look at that.
Oh, that's beautiful.
And then I just want to use some of
these really beautiful little fireweed
flowers
and delicate.
Just a little bit of these really
beautiful hissop leaves because they're
just so pretty.
So basically that's it. just something
really simple with all these dishes, but
you know, it's just going to tell a
story on a plate and it's just about
right now. It's about culture because
our tribes have been utilizing a lot of
these flavors in this region for a long,
long time. Um, and this is just really
healthy, you know.
>> Well, this smells and looks amazing. I'm
really excited to actually taste it.
>> All right. Well, let's give it a go. So,
just take a little piece of the steak um
and get try to get a little bit of all
the pieces, even a little bit of the
leaf in there. Just try to get all of
those things mingling together just to
like experience like all that flavor all
at once.
>> All right, let me try and get a little
bit of everything here.
>> Yeah.
M.
>> That is so good.
>> So just it's really clean, right? And it
just tastes like where we are right now
at this moment. And these flavors have
been utilized for so long.
cities like New York or Chicago or LA,
like you can find food from all over the
world, but can you really find food from
the land that you're standing on? And
it's so rare, you know? So, we want to
normalize that because we want the next
generation of especially indigenous kids
when they're out and about and trying to
decide what they want for dinner. Do
they want pizza? Do they want Chinese?
Do they want Native American? like we
just want to be on that list, bro.
>> After spending the day with Linda and
Sean, something I've been thinking about
a lot is how what we put into our body,
it's not just food, it's not just
nutrition, it's also information.
Information that can change the way that
we think about history, that can change
the way that we think about the culture
of the place where we live. And that can
change our connection to the land, to
the plants, and to the people around us.
If we can get tribes to really consider
um that there is a path to control their
own food, to be able to grow their own
food, to harvest their own food, to
preserve their own food, to make um more
than enough food for their entire
community with the spaces that they
have. There's plenty of ways to work
towards that. And I think that if we can
control our food, we can really control
the power that we have um for our
future, you know. And so I just really
hope people can see that we can learn so
much from our ancestors because we're
not trying to create food that's a
museum piece and trying to go backwards
to 1491 of what were we eating long
before European settlers showed up.
We're looking at the future of like how
can we adopt a lot of the knowledge base
from our ancestors. Apply that to what
we know today and how do we think about
the future cuz we have every every
single day we're alive. We can think
about changing the future.

cesx1-XaLb8,"The Wicked Witch of the West has green
skin.
She wears black.
We are very familiar with the Wizard of
Oz story that tells us the Wicked Witch
of the West is evil. Beside her, Glenda
sparkles in pink and glitter. These
colors confirm who is good and who is
wicked, or so we think. But when I read
the script more closely, I realized
Alphaba is intelligent.
She's compassionate. She's
misunderstood.
Glenda, on the other side, isn't always
kind. I wasn't designing stereotypes. I
was designing questions.
Who decides who is worthy of respect and
who is shunned? Who decides who is
cherished and who is ostracized?
who decides who belongs and who is cast
out. As a black gay man entering into a
field that wasn't always comfortable
with my presence, I know what it feels
like to be otherred, to be misjudged at
first glance. Wicked isn't just about a
witch. It's about anyone who has ever
been judged without uh speaking a word.
What makes someone wicked? It isn't the
color of their skin. It isn't the story
that we've been told. And it isn't what
they wear. It's our perception. It's the
costume we've been handed and whether we
choose to believe it. My job, my joy is
in making you reimagine the answers to
those questions because wickedness can
be designed. And if it can be designed
then maybe together it can be
redesigned.",,
zxKFzT6GjUk,"Most of the medicines that we use
to treat diseases today
work by interacting with just one type
of protein in the body at a time.
But our cells communicate with one another
using a complex language
that involves many different
types of proteins,
all interacting with each other.
This means that modern
medicines, while amazing,
are the linguistic equivalent
to only knowing a single word.
My team and I at AI Proteins are focused
on becoming fluent
in the language of cells --
and how cells talk to one another --
and unlocking the next
generation of medicines
that are safer and more effective.
We've developed a new type of protein
that's better at communicating with cells.
We call them miniproteins.
These are peptides,
40 to 60 amino acids long,
that fold into three dimensional shapes,
much like a protein does.
And those typically have
hundreds of amino acids.
And all of the proteins
that our bodies naturally produce
are built from a common
amino acid alphabet.
We use the same alphabet
for our miniproteins
because we want them
to be as safe as possible.
Using generative artificial intelligence,
we design our miniproteins from scratch,
and this allows us to control
everything about them.
We design them to be small
because this helps them
to get around inside the body.
We design them to be nice and stable.
This simplifies manufacturing
and administration to patients.
But not too stable,
because we still want the body
to be able to digest them
after the job is done.
Most importantly,
we design miniproteins
so that we can link them together.
This is necessary
to communicate with cells
in a more sophisticated way.
When you speak a language,
you don't just know the words,
you know grammar,
so that you can write phrases
that provide cogent instructions.
For example, we can now talk
with a particular type of immune cell.
We can call to them by name,
and we can tell them to go out
and attack cancer.
And provide context
and logic for how this action
should be carried out,
like leave normal, healthy tissue alone
while you're doing it.
We’ve shown the power of miniproteins
by taking mice, giving them arthritis,
and treating their joint inflammation.
We've taken diabetic mice
and used miniprotein medicines
to control blood glucose levels.
We've implanted mice with leukemia tumors
and used human immune cells to treat them,
along with a miniprotein
that told them what to do.
And we are just getting started.
There are many more diseases
that we've treated in a test tube
using miniproteins that we designed.
The next step is to bring this technology
and our pipeline of transformative
new medicines to patients.
We announced the first miniprotein
pharma partnership last year
with Bristol Myers Squibb
to create four new medicines.
Separately, our first clinical trial
is planned to begin in 2028
with the goal of helping patients
suffering from lung cancer.
Miniproteins enable a fundamentally
new way of thinking about medicine.
And I am very excited
by all that is possible
now that we have the ability
to speak fluently with our cells.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)",,

YQRt9TfpetM,"Before I get started,
I just want a quick show of hands.
Who here has teens or pre-teen children?
OK, cool, that's a lot of you.
I just want to know,
has the experience been for you
the same as it's been for me?
And by that I mean very connective,
the communication is always very clear,
there's never any conflict,
definitely no sneakiness.
Same, same?
OK, great, good good, good.
I'm glad we can start
all on the same page.
But it's wild, isn't it?
How quickly our children are growing.
I began thinking a little while ago,
how do I find a way
to stay connected with my children
when they're in this stage?
When they were little,
they would climb up onto my lap
and ask me to sing them lullabies
and read them stories.
And now I feel the time
that we have together
just slipping through my fingers.
My kids are digital native youth,
and that means the entire time
they've been around
so have video games and smartphones
and the internet
and all of the technology.
So I've been watching my kids
play video games for a while now,
but I had no interest myself
until I had this genius idea.
I wondered, what if instead of trying
to pull my kids into my world with me,
what would it be like if I stepped
into their world with them?
I mean, back in the day,
I was pretty good at ""Diddy Kong Racing.""
So like, how hard can it be?
Picture this.
I'm sitting at my house
with my headset on,
with my PC in front of me,
and my kids are over at their dad's house.
My oldest, who are then 10 and 12,
are there with their headsets on
and their devices,
and we all dive in to the wonderful,
magic, mysterious world of ""Fortnite.""
Immediately my kids are off,
racking up points,
opening treasure chests.
I literally don't know what they're doing
because I am right where I landed,
spinning in a circle.
Don't even know how to open
a door or open a treasure chest
or move on to anything.
And pretty soon,
I have to let my kids know
I've been shot and I'm down.
(Laughter)
Immediately, my 12-year-old said,
“It’s OK, hold on, Mom.”
And this kid comes running towards me,
building a structure
out of literally nothing
and holding his hand over me to heal me.
That was kind of cool.
I didn't know you could heal people.
My middle son --
if you have a middle son,
you can probably relate with this --
he comes crashing a semi truck
through the wall his brother just made,
hops out in a full body banana costume
and lays his hand over me to heal me.
After the exasperated sigh
of ""Why do I have to?""
That was the point
where I could have quit,
where I could have said,
""I'm terrible at video games.
This is not for me.""
But I didn't quit.
I didn't quit because
we were laughing so hard.
I was laughing at the absolute absurdity
of this entire situation,
and I suspect they
might have been laughing
at how completely terrible
I was at video games.
But at that point they decided
that they would stick closer to me
and teach me how to play this game.
But I didn't just learn about the game.
I learned about them.
I learned about the connections
that they make together
and the way they communicate
while they're playing these games.
And maybe the most importantly,
I learned this is the connection
that I've been craving as well.
I feel like we played
and connected in a way
that not a lot of teens
and parents get to connect.
Because we connected through play,
we connected through them
teaching me a new skill
and me being brave enough
or silly enough to think
I could maybe play along.
And as it turns out, I wasn't alone.
I was talking to my brother Amos
about video games
and he told me something surprising.
He told me that he has connected
with his nieces and nephews
more through video games
than anything else in the entire world.
Before you judge him too harshly,
you need to understand
that Uncle Amos lives in New Zealand.
Before he was in New Zealand,
he lived in Germany.
So the entire time
that my kids have been around,
they've never known Uncle Amos.
They've never been
in the same country as him.
He would not get an hour-long
phone call from my kids.
But hopping on ""Fortnite,""
playing games together,
making memories together.
Maybe learning how absolutely feral
my middle son is.
It's a game changer.
Now, you might be sitting
there wondering, what is esports?
Luckily, it's pretty simple.
Esports are just competitive video games.
Anything can be an esport
if it's a competitive digital game.
Games like ""Fortnite,""
shooter games like that can be an esport,
or games like chess can be an esport
if it's played with computers.
What ties them all together
is that they're all competitive.
If you have ever talked to a child,
like ever in your life,
you've probably heard of games like
""Mario Kart,"" ""Fortnite,"" ""Rocket League.""
All esports or electronic sports.
But do not call them electronic sports
because you will lose
all of your street cred,
especially with your children.
Trust me on that one.
And it's not just my kids
who get to have this experience now,
because the state
of South Dakota this year
sanctioned esports
as a high school activity.
Yeah, that's pretty great.
(Applause)
So right now, kids
are playing esports teams
within the four walls
of schools in South Dakota.
This is important because
these kids are not just playing,
they're practicing,
they're practicing and gaining skills
that they will use
for the rest of their lives.
Skills like leadership, teamwork,
communication, strategy,
and the ability to handle tough emotions.
So fast forward to these
same kids starting their careers.
Businesses also get to benefit
from the skills that kids have gained
in high school and in college.
And in that same vein, we can talk
about the inclusivity of esports.
I challenge you to think of a more
inclusive sport anywhere in the world.
It doesn't matter your age,
your background, or your ability.
Anyone can play, compete,
grow and win in esports.
Of course, there's other benefits
that I didn't notice
until I got further into this
with my children.
I understand that as a parent,
video games and esports
are kind of a complicated subject
because we fear the communication
that happens within these spaces,
especially because sometimes
our kids are talking to strangers.
I think that that's a valid fear.
And I understand now,
when I joined my kids in this space,
I got to learn with them
and helped teach them
how to navigate this space.
I also learned that it's not just scary.
There's joy in these spaces
because this is a shared space
and we can have shared experiences here.
When I was there with them,
I got a first-hand glimpse
into their world,
and I learned how to better protect them
and help them through this space.
In fact, video games even helped me
when it was time to introduce
my kids to someone new.
As a single parent,
it can be kind of awkward
to introduce your kids
to your significant other.
So a couple months
before we introduced our families,
we all hopped on Fortnite
to play together.
This is a life hack, I am serious.
So we, his kids and my kids and us
all jumped on Fortnite together
and it was pretty awesome
because there was no pressure of like,
if we didn't have something to talk about,
we're just playing a game,
we don't have to talk.
If things weren't going so great,
we could just dip.
We didn't have to stay
for any certain amount of time.
I got to see how he responded to my kids'
silly, competitive or sometimes
a little bit feral nature.
And I also got to see
how he responded to his children
if they were upset
or being critical with each other.
And then,
when the time came for us
to introduce our families in person,
we all had something to talk about.
And maybe this idea
isn't so new after all.
Because back when I was a kid,
my parents told me
that TV would rot our brains
and threw our TV into the trash.
Growing up in rural
South Dakota in the '90s,
I really didn't miss our TV that much.
If you grew up in South Dakota
in the wild, wild west
or east, in my case,
of South Dakota in the '90s,
you probably have a pretty good idea
about what we got up to.
If not, let me paint you a picture.
Imagine trying to ride cattle in a field.
Maybe climbing up to the second-story roof
of an outbuilding in the winter
to hop on your sled and go
screaming down the other side?
Or maybe the timeless tradition
of daring your city slicker friends
to touch the electric fence,
knowing full well how that will feel
because you yourself have touched
the electric fence a time or two.
But these are all memorable
parts of my childhood
and stories for another day.
But I will never forget the Christmas
that my parents surprised us
with a Nintendo 64.
This gorgeous electronic
came with four controllers,
and it turns out my parents
didn't throw our TV away.
They just put it in storage.
So they brought that old box down
and we all got to sit down
and play together.
It was a blast playing with my brothers
and sometimes I even won.
Like I said, I was pretty good
at Diddy Kong Racing.
But the true joy came when we would get
to connect with my dad.
You see, my dad had two
distinct sides to his personality.
On one side, he was pretty strict
and serious and a disciplinarian,
which I understand,
he was raising a gaggle of children,
so that can kind of be expected.
But on the other side of him,
he was playful and carefree
and absolutely hilarious.
And when we all got
to race and play together,
this is the part of him
that we got to see.
My brother Ezra told me a story
about one day he was sitting
at home playing ""Halo,""
and Dad came home on his lunch break.
Dad sat down and started playing with him
and pretty soon, half an hour goes past.
Then an hour, and then
it's two hours later.
And finally, Ezra is like,
“Dad, don’t you have to be at work?”
And Dad said, “Work can wait.
We're saving the world right now.""
(Laughter)
My dad didn't really like video games.
He didn't really --
He didn't like them,
nor was he good at them.
But he chose to connect with us there
because that's where we were.
He chose to speak our language
even though he didn't really like it.
Now that he's been gone for eight years,
I wish that we could make more of those
memories with my kids and with us.
And as a mother now,
I draw from those experiences
as much as I can.
Whenever my kids ask me to play
""Fortnite"" or ""Minecraft"" with them,
it doesn't matter how busy I am,
I never regret sitting down
and playing with them.
Video games have surprised me
in so many ways,
from schools creating a sense
of belonging for kids
who wouldn't otherwise have that,
to teaching them skills
for their lives that they will use
for the rest of their lives.
From my dad playing with us growing up
and me playing with my children,
when I speak of esports,
people come out of the woodwork
to share their stories with me.
Not stories of sitting in a basement
and chugging energy drinks.
Stories about connection.
That's what brings this all together.
When I began pondering how I would share
this story about esports with you all,
I realized if I wouldn't have said yes
when my kids asked me to play ""Fortnite,""
none of this would have happened.
I said yes to them,
and then my boss asked me
if I would drive up
to northern Minnesota
to research this esports competition
and see what it would take
to make that happen here in Sioux Falls.
I started learning from
and with my colleagues
about how to build this
right here in Sioux Falls.
And then last September,
I got to co-lead South Dakota's
first all-ages free esports competition
in Sioux Falls,
and our board of directors
has agreed to bring it back
for round two this October.
(Cheers and applause)
And now, today, I'm standing
here on this TEDx stage.
Somewhere I never saw myself
in a million years.
But this whole journey started
with wanting to connect with my sons.
And ultimately, that's who
I'm still trying to connect with.
What I found through
flailing around Fortnite,
saying yes to unexpected opportunities,
and learning alongside my children
is that connection is always worth it,
even if you don't know
how to open the door.
My sons are who I keep saying yes to,
and I would say, the best
unexpected benefit of all --
my kids legitimately think I'm cool.
(Laughter)
(Applause)",,
j0XdDGiZs9M,"And I often get asked if I think I'm
ever going to build something useful.
And maybe someday I will. But the way I
see it, I already have because I've
built myself this job. It's something
that I can never have planned for.
Instead, it happened just because I was
enthusiastic about what I was doing and
I was sharing that enthusiasm with other
people. To me, there's the true beauty
of making useless things because it's
this acknowledgment that you don't
always know what the best answer is. And

BZflSdA4Q44,"What makes someone wicked?
Is it the color of their skin?
Is it the story we've been told?
Or is it what they wear?
How do we make those judgments?
What clues do we rely on?
What assumptions do we carry,
sometimes without even realizing it?
As a costume designer,
it's my job to use those assumptions,
for better or for worse.
People often assume
my job is all fabric and sequins,
dresses, buttons,
maybe a good hat.
In truth, my job is about perception.
I am a storyteller,
and my medium,
my language, is clothing.
Through silhouette, color and texture.
I shape how you see someone
before they speak a word.
I decide whether
you lean forward with curiosity
or pull back with suspicion.
When I put a character
in a shade of scarlet,
or wrap them in velvet,
or cut them up in sharp black lines,
I'm asking you to feel
something about them,
instantly, silently.
That's what fascinates me.
How simple fabric
can tell us who is a hero
and who is wicked.
I seek out a thematic hook
in every project.
Something human,
something that allows me
to find myself in the story.
I'm not just decorating a character,
I'm telling a parallel story,
one that lives in the clothing.
Costumes are not static.
They move with the body.
They evolve.
Sometimes they even tell lies.
They reflect growth, conflict, resolution.
I can telegraph an entire emotional arc
in the fit of a jacket,
the fraying of a hem,
the way fabric breaks down under stress.
What's extraordinary is this:
you feel it, even if you don’t realize it.
Costume is a subconscious language.
I'm using your power of perception
to lead you through the story.
This manipulation of perception
carried me to ""Hamilton.""
At its core, ""Hamilton"" is a story
of us versus them.
Colonists versus empire.
Immigrants versus the establishment.
But Lin-Manuel Miranda
handed me something radical.
He said, ""I want the audience
to see our Founding Fathers
through today's lens.""
So imagine that challenge.
Black and brown bodies
dressed in 18-century coats and breeches,
rapping about revolution.
History reimagined in real time.
I design period silhouettes, yes,
but with restraint.
Neutral tones on much of the ensemble,
while allowing their skin to show through,
and the power of their voice
to ring true in center stage.
And then, in contrast,
King George III appears in full regalia,
bewigged, jewelled,
painted in perfect detail
from his portraitist.
He is the Old World, they are the New.
That visual duality,
modern bodies in period shape,
versus one man preserved in all his pomp,
is what makes the story
of democracy unfolding so compelling.
It takes the historically familiar
to frame a modern perception
of how our nation was formed.
And suddenly, there's Thomas Jefferson.
Tommy Kail, our director, and I, decided,
let's make him a rock star.
So on struts Jefferson
in flamboyant purple,
modeled after a pop icon.
Not by chance.
That was a statement.
History isn't dry or static.
It's alive.
It's charismatic.
It's complicated.
Even in subtle contrast,
like Hamilton's vibrant green suits
versus Burr's muted raisin palette.
I was planting seeds,
setting up a visual duel.
Until finally, at the end,
the two men stand together,
both in black capes,
equal in power,
equal in tragedy,
balanced, not in life,
but in history's memory.
The costumes weren't decoration.
They were commentary,
a way to ask whose history is this?
And who gets to own it?
From the Founding Fathers,
I jumped to 1950s New York
with Spielberg's ""West Side Story.""
Again, us versus them,
Jets versus Sharks,
white versus Puerto Rican.
For the Jets, I leaned
into blue-collar toughness.
Denim, polos, sneakers,
the uniform of boys rooted in concrete.
For the Sharks,
I turned to Latin textiles,
vibrant florals,
colors inspired by sun and sea,
but cut with elegance and aspiration.
These young men and women were dressing
for a life they were yet to claim.
I rejected the impulse
that these two gangs
are just mirror images of each other,
separated by language and skin color.
At the same time,
I clung to what was iconic,
like Anita's dress,
but gave it my own twist.
And then the dance at the gym,
that iconic scene
where the two worlds collide.
I let the colors bleed together,
warm tones crossing cool,
fabric echoing across lines.
Because even in conflict cultures mix,
the borders are never
as fixed as we pretend.
Design here could have
perpetuated stereotypes,
but my goal was to dismantle them,
to give both sides dignity,
authenticity, complexity.
The tragedy of ""West Side Story""
isn't that these two sides
were so different.
The real antagonist was the city itself,
a system of development and displacement
that was tearing
their neighborhoods apart.
Both gangs were fighting for ground
they would lose regardless.
Costume allowed me
to underline that truth.
The beauty wasn't in the separation,
it was in the blend.
Then came ""Wicked.""
Elphaba, the Wicked Witch
of the West, has green skin.
She wears black.
We're very familiar
with the ""Wizard of Oz"" story
that tells us the Wicked Witch
of the West is evil.
Beside her, Glinda sparkles
in pink and glitter.
These colors confirm
who is good and who is wicked.
Or so we think.
But when I read the script more closely,
I realized Elphaba is intelligent.
She’s compassionate. She’s misunderstood.
Glinda, on the other side,
isn't always kind.
I wasn't designing stereotypes.
I was designing questions.
Who decides who is worthy of respect
and who is shunned?
Who decides who is cherished
and who is ostracized?
Who decides who belongs
and who is cast out?
As a black gay man entering into a field
that wasn't always comfortable
with my presence,
I know what it feels like to be othered,
to be misjudged at first glance.
Maybe that's why I'm drawn to stories
about marginalized characters.
""Wicked"" isn't just about a witch.
It's about anyone
who has ever been judged
without speaking a word.
Why put so much care into costumes?
Because clothing carries memory.
A dress, a chair, a lamp,
these things hold
the fingerprints of their makers.
They capture a culture
at a particular moment in time.
They embody our aspirations
and our biases.
The clothes we wear,
the furniture we sit on,
the art we hang on our walls,
these things are costumes too.
They shape our identity.
They create culture.
Design is never neutral.
So I ask the question again.
What makes someone wicked?
It isn't the color of their skin.
It isn't the story that we've been told.
And it isn't what they wear.
It's our perception.
It's the costume we've been handed
and whether we choose to believe it.
My job, my joy,
is in making you reimagine
the answers to those questions.
Because wickedness can be designed.
And if it can be designed,
then maybe together, it can be redesigned.
Thank you.
(Cheers and applause)
Monique Ruff-Bell: Paul,
I have a quick question for you.
It was beautiful to see
your journey of inspiration.
Now with the release of ""Wicked for Good""
is there going to be
an evolution in the costumes,
with the lead characters,
with the evolution of the story?
PT: Absolutely, yeah.
And it's a continuation
of how they evolve.
And I mean, that's really
what I'm talking about,
you know, is that,
you know, to create a reality
even within the world of fantasy
is what helps the story
relate to other people
or helps people relate to that story.
MRB: Absolutely.
And when will we see the magic
of your handiwork again,
after ""Wicked for Good?""
PT: Oh gosh, who knows?
(Laughter)
I would say look to Broadway first,
and then, hopefully,
again on the big screen.
MRB: OK, thank you so much, Paul.

pWKggqO3VlY,"If farming was your primary
source of income,
and if you can't grow anything,
there's not much you can do.
It's very demoralizing.
It's very overwhelming.
A lot of the countries where I work,
farmers face fires, pests,
diseases, droughts and floods.
If crops fail, no food is available
for a lot of people
who depend on what they produce.
It translates into, you know,
sometimes an entire generation
being undermined.
My name is Catherine Nakalembe
and I'm a satellite
food security specialist.
I use satellite data
to map and monitor crops,
and then work to make sure
that information can be used
by decision makers
and organizations that support farmers.
I primarily focus on Africa:
Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia,
Mali, Senegal.
Last time I checked,
there were over 8,000 satellites
observing our Earth.
They take pictures every day.
You can use those images
to map what crops are growing where,
how much it's going to rain,
where weather system might be coming from,
where it might be impacted
and how badly it might be impacted.
I can just sit on my computer
and tell you anywhere in the world,
rainfall, drought, floods, name it.
I can tell you where it is.
We have tons of information,
tons of data about what's happening.
We're living in a fantastic age.
We have huge advances with AI.
We're able to process a lot
more data and information.
The problem is,
when you look deeply at any place,
you start to see problems
with a lot of the existing products.
They're not tailored
to the on-the-ground contexts.
Sometimes it's simply
that the data is just wrong.
A lot of the models are trained very well
to predict for European or US agriculture.
In Europe, most of the farms
have like, a single crop.
They're really big
and it's very easy to model.
In Kenya, in Uganda, in Rwanda, however,
the fields are so tiny,
they have so many different crops in them,
and farmers do things so differently.
It's like a tapestry.
With those images
fields are misrepresented.
So there are places
where there are no crops
but are labeled as crops.
There are places where
there should be crops and people
that are completely missing.
When you go and try
to assess something for the ministry
and you use that as input,
you're basically feeding them garbage.
You want to make sure that what
you're feeding in is really good,
and that actually requires work.
To train a model
to understand that complexity,
you need a lot of examples.
You have to go on the ground.
What we did is we use GoPros.
You wear a GoPro as you're driving
on a motorcycle,
or you can do it in the car.
And as you drive we take pictures.
Basically Google Street View,
not for streets but for crops.
So the camera is actually
facing towards the field
and then adapt basically
what would be face detection
but instead of detecting faces,
cats, dogs, etc.,
we modified it to detect
maize, beans, cassava.
We covered all of western Kenya
in two weeks with just two teams,
collected over five million images.
A lot of them with volunteers every day,
mototaxi drivers, students.
This would allow us to build
a more complex model
that can learn from all these
different examples,
from all the different contexts.
There was a flood in Kenya in 2024.
It happened really, really rapidly.
And, you know, the entire country
was affected, pretty much.
I got an email from the Ministry
of Agriculture asking to do an assessment,
using satellite data to look
at where floods happened,
where were crops,
and give an estimate
of what the total area of cropland
that's been affected was.
And then what the ministry does
with the information
is they make their response programs,
which is where do we need to go
to provide seeds so people can replant.
It's an example of an action
that was taken.
It's really powerful
to be able to do that.
True innovation is not
about high-tech systems,
but about making the technology
fit the problem.
We have to provide really
good information to the people
who can do something with it.
If we do this correctly, we can save time,
we can save money,
we can save livelihoods.",,
W8djC9GoZVw,"I study adolescent brains for a living.
I also study their hormones,
social lives and mental health.
But first, I fell in love
with their brains.
Just look at this beautiful brain
of a 13-year-old girl.
Millions of connecting fibers.
It's like
a piece of art living inside our head.
Isn't that amazing?
Unfortunately, the story we tell
about adolescents isn't so amazing.
We have, as a society,
a long history of judging young people,
underestimating them.
We launch full-blown moral panics
with every trend they set
and technology they embrace.
That sets up bad expectations
where nobody wins.
So my mission is to use science
to help change society's narrative.
Think about it. 
Right now,
the story we tell about adolescents
is they're too anxious, too depressed,
obsessed with their phones,
and full of FOMO.
Rewind a couple decades.
Different story, equally unflattering.
They're too rebellious,
party animals,
maybe glued to their TVs or Ataris.
Why can't they be more like adults,
who, of course, have
exactly the right amount
of mental health issues
and other vices, right?
(Laughter)
Of course not.
But when it comes
to young people, it's a problem.
And we look for something to blame.
Is it their biology?
Maybe the latest technology?
I'm here to tell you
what the science says.
Adolescence isn't a problem to be solved.
It's a transformative period
of growth and opportunity,
and we all have a role to play
in helping them unlock its potential.
So let's dive into the science
of adolescence.
First things first, who is an adolescent?
I can't see very well.
I'm sure there are some in here.
You're probably thinking teenagers, right?
Thank you.
Actually, no.
Scientists say adolescent lasts
from about 10 to 25 years of age.
Why?
Because of how it's defined.
With a biological beginning in puberty
and a social ending
when they gain adult rights,
roles and responsibilities.
Let's start with a biological beginning
and something that probably
nobody in this room
is excited to talk about except me.
[Puberty]
(Laughter)
Puberty.
It's the best.
OK, let's take a quick guided tour.
Puberty is a natural process
everybody goes through
starting around age ten,
give or take a year,
when our brains release hormones
that ultimately change
a lot about our bodies.
We can't see what's going
on inside our bodies
but there are a lot
of outward puberty signs,
from skin, hair and voice changes
to body smells, shapes and size.
One puberty change
that might be a surprise is sleep.
Puberty kick starts a sleep phase delay,
which means an adolescent's
biological clock
doesn't make them feel tired
until one or two hours later than before.
Combine that with everything
going on in their social lives
and ta-da, you have
a new night owl in the family.
Now, if you spend any time
around middle schoolers,
you'll know the range
in these puberty signs is huge,
especially between boys and girls,
because on average,
girls start puberty about one
or two years earlier than boys.
So you can thank puberty
for so many awkward middle-school dances.
(Laughter)
When you see the signs
that puberty is starting,
something really important
to know is this:
going through puberty earlier
than your same-age, same-sex peers
is linked with more depression risk,
especially in girls.
But the surprising thing
we've learned about that is
it's not the hormones
increasing that risk.
It's how young people, girls,
feel their bodies are changing
compared to others.
That's because having your body
change so dramatically
changes how you feel about yourself,
and that matters for your mental health.
It also changes how society sees you.
One way this shows up
is in something called adultification.
When we see more grown-up looking bodies,
we treat them differently.
We have different expectations.
For example,
older boys assume early-maturing girls
are more interested in things like sex.
And adultification also happens
in our education and justice systems
where it's extra harmful.
The bigger picture here
is we love to blame hormones,
but biology matters less
than how young people see themselves
and how society sees them
during this stage of life.
That's actually a good thing.
We can't avoid hormone changes forever,
but we can make puberty a little easier
by combining greater awareness
of some of these puberty-related risks
and biases I just talked about
with open communication.
Look, if you can talk candidly
about puberty to a middle schooler,
you have set the foundation
for honest conversations,
not just about physical health,
but all kinds of important things to come.
Besides hormones,
another slice of adolescent biology
we misunderstand is their brains.
The idea that teenagers
have immature brains
and that's why they make
such bad decisions,
it's everywhere.
Where did that come from?
In the 1990s and 2000s
neuroscientists learned
that adolescent brain changes
don't really level out
until your mid-twenties.
This brain science was so striking
that it helped shape multiple
Supreme Court decisions,
most importantly, ending
the death penalty for minors.
Now we've basically --
yeah, applause for that.
(Applause)
Science that matters.
(Applause)
Now we've basically embraced the idea
that the adolescent brain
is still developing.
That's fantastic.
But ...
There's a risk that the same science
used to protect youth
can be misapplied to limit their rights,
like to vote or make their own
healthcare decisions.
So I have a really important
message to share.
Decades of research show
adolescents can make good decisions
about big things.
Around age 16,
their decision-making abilities
basically match those of adults
when they have the time
and space to think carefully.
It's interesting, right?
I just told you the adolescent brain
is still changing to the mid-20s,
but these key decision-making
abilities are online earlier.
So I think that it's time we reframe
our view of adolescent brains.
Don't think of them as immature.
They're perfectly suited
to meet the needs of young people.
Their brains prime them to explore,
learn quickly from rewards,
and be sensitive to social status.
It's easy to think
of those things as liabilities,
but that would be a mistake.
They're actually powerful assets
at a time in life when building identity,
independence and new relationships
outside the family really matters.
So ...
Let's acknowledge all the amazing
things that adolescents can do
and to be super concrete,
if you find that a young
person's right to vote
or make their own healthcare decisions
is on the ballot in the future,
don't forget, research shows
these are exactly the things
they can do well by age 16.
(Applause)
I thought I studied the biggest
and baddest monsters of adolescence,
and then smartphones entered the chat.
Forget biology.
The most explosive story right now
is that social media
is destroying this generation.
It's true that youth anxiety,
depression and suicide risk
are at alarming levels.
But are smartphones to blame?
Anyone want to know what the science says?
OK, you ready?
Social media use
is one of the least influential factors
shaping youth mental health.
I know, this isn't what we're being told.
And the kicker is, I know
it probably doesn’t feel true
if you parent or teach adolescents.
But here's the thing.
Science doesn't care
if something feels true.
(Laughter)
(Applause and cheers)
Let me tell you the facts.
Scientists have a way
of statistically summarizing information
across all the studies on a topic.
It’s called a meta-analysis.
Meta-analyses are great
because they can keep you
from getting science whiplash.
You know, when the headlines
ping-pong back and forth
with each new shiny study.
Anyways, there are a lot
of them on this topic
and they consistently show
really small effects.
Excessive time on social media
is linked with maybe
15 percent higher levels
of mental health problems
in youth, at most.
That's like nudging from 20 percent,
which is the current baseline risk
for adolescent depression,
up to 23 percent.
The effect is so small,
it almost gets lost in the noise.
And in fact, when studies do a good job
accounting for the many known risk factors
in adolescent depression,
that's exactly what happens.
The effect basically disappears.
This makes sense if social
media use is like a marker
of youth mental health problems,
a correlate and not the cause.
Now those other risk factors,
those should be on your list
because you have way more impact.
Take relationships.
Whether you're 16 or 60,
they matter for your mental health.
For example, youth who are bullied
have double the risk
of developing depression.
That's a way bigger effect.
But an adolescent
with high-quality friendships,
they can spend four
or five hours a day online,
and still have over a 90 percent chance
of great mental health and well-being.
If four to five hours a day
kind of freaks you out,
that's the current national average
for 13-to 19-year-olds.
What about families?
The good news is they can protect
against bad outcomes
from even the worst experiences,
including bullying.
But parent mental health problems
more than triple the risk
of adolescents developing them, too,
3.5 times greater risk.
I don't say this to blame parents.
My point is just that parents matter
way more than phones.
Look, as someone deeply invested
in the well-being of young people,
both as a scientist and as a mom,
I wish the answer were as simple
as shutting off the phones.
But the science is clear.
We won't be able to solve this
by focusing on social media alone.
In fact,
young people often turn online first
for mental health resources and support.
So what do we do?
Big system-level changes
are needed to fix this, no question.
But we're not powerless.
If you're worried
about youth mental health,
build their resilience.
Listen, provide support.
Help them learn
that feelings and failures
are a normal part of adolescence.
Because they're a normal part of life.
I love how this message is for all of us.
It's for parents, especially.
Even the best parents fail sometimes.
We have hard days and big feelings.
But too few of us get
the support that we need.
So if you're struggling
with your own mental health,
know that asking for help
makes you a great parent,
because one of the best predictors
of this generation's well-being
is the mental health of those
who care for them.
In other words, put your own
oxygen mask on first.
Alright.
(Applause)
Let's land this thing.
Adolescence last
from 10 to 25 years of age
when bodies, brains, relationships
and mental health are all changing.
But it's not the biological
or psychological changes
alone that define adolescence.
We do.
We are all in this together.
That means
we have to stop doom-shaming young people.
If we keep saying this generation
is being destroyed,
how can we expect them
to believe in their own potential?
(Applause)
Instead, we need to respect
their growing strengths,
create space for them to contribute
at home, at school and in the community.
Honestly, we need young people
just as much as they need
our love and support.
Their ability to adapt
to our rapidly-changing world,
it's a superpower.
It's time to change the narrative.
Adolescents,
they're not a problem to be solved.
They represent our brightest future.
Thank you.
(Applause)",,
NVwOsm1edT8,"What do you think makes some people
leave their hometowns and some people
stay?
>> I think the relationship with one's
place of origin is [snorts]
by definition I think a contentious one
because you don't choose it. Place is
something that happens to you. What
keeps me here? I guess I can't speak to
why people leave. But there is one woman
on a street in East Columbus who
has held on to her house no matter what.
She's been offered so much money, been
offered so much to move out of that
house because if she moves out of that
house, it is the entry point to kind of
raise that neighborhood and make it
something else and she refuses to leave.
Her refusal,
I think, is an action that the my work
is pointing towards. My very presence is
stopping the worst designs of a city
that has no idea who its population
actually is. And my staying here means
I'm actually keeping a history that
existed before me and a history that I
want to exist after me.
Cuz what's the point of staying in a
neighborhood if the neighborhood no
longer feels like it's a place where
you're welcome or if you cannot be
translated through the new population of
that neighborhood.",,
nxsrS049xaY,"Have you ever smelled a landfill?
Well, that smell is probably
not the worst thing that it produces.
Methane gas is.
And you cannot see it or smell it
until it catches fire.
And that's unfortunately
what's been happening
in many cities across the continent.
In Dakar, in Accra, in Kampala, in Lusaka,
and recently at the Pietermaritzburg
landfill in South Africa.
Now just imagine being one
of the thousands of kids
affected by that fire.
Every breath you take
is kind of a tighter chest,
a sharper headache.
It's really unacceptable.
And these landfills,
they catch fire for many reasons.
One of them is that we keep
sending organic waste there
that decays in the absence of oxygen,
creating the conditions
for methane to come up.
There's many ways that we know
how to solve this question
of dangerous landfills.
First of all, stop producing as much waste
and sending it there.
Sort and treat what's already there
and radically improve
the governance of those sites.
Doing that homework
has immediate benefits,
particularly for populations
living nearby.
It improves air quality
and it reduces the risk of fire.
And it turns out that addressing methane
out of these landfills
plays a very important role
in tackling the global question
of climate change.
I’m a social economic
development professional.
I've spent the bulk of my career
looking at how this continent transforms
to meet the demands
and the ambitions of its people
at the intersection of democracy,
security and economic opportunity.
And it's kind of always been clear to me
to get to a certain degree
of sustainable development,
we need to embed climate in our plans.
And I’ve joined the Global Methane Hub,
and it’s become abundantly clear
that effective climate progress
also requires methane action.
And that is because methane
is such a powerful greenhouse gas.
It has contributed up to 45 percent
of the net warming
that we're experiencing today.
That's because it is 86 times
more powerful at trapping heat
than carbon dioxide is over 20 years.
And all of you, and myself,
we know that we've got to do
so many things simultaneously
to address this question
of both climate and development,
and long-term decarbonization
is one of the primary goals.
But methane offers us
an additional opportunity.
If we're able to come together
and reduce methane emissions
by 50 percent over the next 20 years,
it allows us the opportunity
to lower the rate of global warming
by 0.3 degrees Celsius.
That may not sound like much,
but it is a lifeline.
It is also one of the most effective
ways that we know of
to reduce short-term
climate-induced vulnerability,
and that is important
all over the globe, obviously,
but it is critically important
for this continent
that's disproportionately affected
by the effects of climate change.
We lose up to five percent
of our yearly economic output
to adverse climate events.
The costs of adapting societies,
our societies and our economies,
to changing climate are skyrocketing,
upwards of 50 billion dollars.
So this idea of addressing
short-term vulnerability,
it’s not a nice-to-have,
it's an imperative as we build
towards long-term resilience.
And look, 60 percent of these
vulnerability-inducing emissions
come from sectors that have traditionally
been associated with economic progress:
fossil fuel energy,
waste management and sanitation,
as well as agriculture,
rice production and livestock.
And what you're seeing behind me
is a map that shows you
cumulative emissions
over the past 50 years.
You have sharp eyes, and you're seeing
that some regions are emitting
a lot more than others
and need to do a lot more and a lot faster
to address their own emissions
if we're going to meet
our collective objectives.
This map shows you per capita,
emissions per person in 2023.
Again, sharp eyes.
You'll notice that Africa
has a lower footprint
than many other regions.
But that is changing.
It's changing because
we're growing populations,
we're growing our economies.
And so we've kind of
got to embrace this duality
where we absolutely need to usher in
a new developmental model
that rapidly lifts people out of poverty,
creates opportunity
and provides for more dignity,
but to do so in a way
that minimizes these emissions
that are creating the vulnerability
that plagues us today.
And luckily, it's happening
in many ways on the continent.
Let's think back to those
burning landfills that we discussed.
Well, in Durban,
a different picture is coming up.
Organizations have come together,
civil society, government officials,
research institutions,
to ensure that no or less organic waste
ends up in a landfill
35 kilometers outside of the city,
and therefore hopefully
limiting methane emissions.
And to do so, they've partnered
with two of the largest
city fruit and vegetable markets.
And rather than throwing away
unused or unsold produce,
they collect it and they transform it
into an asset class.
They compost it.
Remarkably, over two years,
they've been able to divert 277 tons
of organic waste away from landfill.
They've created sustainable,
safe, well-paying jobs for the community.
They have reduced the city's costs
in landfilling and transportation.
And that compost that you're seeing
is going to improve the quality
of city parks
that families like yours and mine
can end up enjoying.
These are real benefits
that also end up reducing methane,
and it is the power
of community-driven action,
underpinned by a circular economy approach
that is part and parcel
of the systemic change that we need to see
and that needs to be supported
by better policy,
better financing and improved governance.
But let's also talk about energy.
Fossil fuels are a major contributor
to global methane emissions.
It is also one of the sectors
where we kind of know how to abate
at cost in the short term.
But let's also be very clear:
this continent will need more energy
for better development.
That's an existential question for us.
And luckily for all of us,
actually in this room,
80 percent of new generation capacity
coming online in the next few years here
will come from renewables.
And if we're able
to strategically pair that
with adequate investments
and adequate planning,
it accelerates our ability
to diversify our energy mix
away from reliance on fossil fuels.
And that is really important
first and foremost
for our own energy security.
It is also critically important
because it helps us abate emissions today
as we transition in the long term.
Because, mind you, the industry,
oil and gas industry in particular,
absolutely knows how to solve
their emissions problem.
Reduce flares, detect and plug your leaks,
improve measurement, do it all over again.
And they have the money to do it.
It's just not happening
at the scale and the speed
that we need it to happen.
We just cannot rely
on voluntary commitments.
We absolutely need regulatory frameworks
that compel corporate action,
because otherwise this is what we get.
This is a gas flare.
It is the burning of methane gas
associated with oil extraction.
And it is as dangerous,
as wasteful as it looks.
It is associated with high levels
of respiratory diseases
and high fevers, particularly in children.
And astonishingly, two million people
in the Niger Delta in Nigeria
live within a four-kilometer radius
of one of these things.
And so what do we do?
We regulate, we enforce and we track.
And that's exactly what the government
of Nigeria has been trying to do.
It has essentially passed
progressive regulation
to ensure that it is banning flaring.
Enforcement is where the challenge is,
but they're doing so
because it makes sense
from a public health perspective
and it saves lives,
but it also fundamentally
makes economic sense.
It creates a potential revenue stream
for government from non-compliant actors,
but it also reduces energy waste
in a country that is plagued
with energy insecurity.
Regulate and force and track.
Let's talk about something else.
Rice.
Some of you are smiling.
I know you love it. Many people love it.
It's a major global food crop.
In fact, it is consumed
by billions of people
from Tokyo to my hometown
Conakry in Guinea.
And we will need
to be producing more of it
to meet food security demands.
And rice production is actually
both affected by climate change
and partly contributes to it
because it emits methane.
Think about the millions
of farmers who grow it.
Typically what they do
is they flood their fields.
By flooding the field,
oxygen cannot get into the soil
and it creates the conditions
for methane to emerge.
And so how do we solve this?
How do we ensure
that we're improving productivity
and production to meet food security,
but doing so in a way
that minimizes emissions?
Well, 11,000 farmers in Accra, in Ghana,
or around Accra,
are working very closely with
their Environmental Protection Agency,
and they're attempting to use a method
called alternate wetting and drying.
This is a method that only when conditions
are suitable and applicable,
allows them to naturally
drain the water off their field.
In doing so, they are managing
the incredibly scarce resource
that is water,
but they're also managing
production and productivity,
and limiting methane emissions.
That is good for the producers,
it's good for consumers,
it's good for food security,
because ultimately we will need
more resilient and sustainable
production systems
that also reward smallholder farmers.
And we can't stop there.
We absolutely need to continue
to have multidisciplinary spaces
in which we provide more solutions,
more cost-effective solutions,
less risky solutions to these farmers
who are central to the systemic change
that we want to see in food systems.
And listen, what I've described here
is a series of projects and initiatives
that essentially show a window
into the nexus between
climate development and methane.
And it's certainly not a panacea.
And they need scale,
and they need improvement.
But what they do show
is progress that builds momentum
that people can get behind
because they can see the benefits.
And we will undoubtedly
need that momentum,
partly because to get
to a high-development
and low-methane future,
we will need systemic improvements.
And that's also why some of the things
that African nations
have been working towards
require a lot more support,
particularly in ensuring that we're able
to raise domestic resources and capital
that allows us to self-fund
climate and development
in a way that increases agency
and decision-making here on the continent.
Things like bringing together
African financial institutions
around the Africa Club,
or addressing the incredibly high cost
of capital that we face,
or sovereign debt burdens.
Unlocking that capital is integral
to moving methane action forward,
because unfortunately,
a lot of these methane emissions
are going up, globally,
and much of it is also underreported.
And so there's really
no getting around or away from
the centrality of governance
and accountability,
of which we will need more of
first of all at home,
because we need to manage
our affairs better,
but also globally
to ensure that we're understanding
where these emissions are coming from
and how we tackle them equitably
for greater collective impact.
It's also the case that
in this distributed multipolar world.
Eventually we will probably need more
rather than less collaboration,
particularly leaning
into domestic capacity
in a much more creative
and distributed way
across geographies and across disciplines
to support better scientific research
and breakthroughs,
to improve data measurement
capacity across the globe,
and to get to more effective
financing options.
And I have no doubt that this continent
will rise to the challenge.
First of all, because it is
in our own self-interest
to move away from vulnerability
and into resilience,
but also because
it is a necessary thing to do.
And I've spoken a little bit
about some of the co-benefits of methane,
and you'll hear a lot of that,
but perhaps it's fitting
to flip the script a little bit.
Maybe when we build systems and societies
that reward safer,
cleaner and livable cities,
more resilient,
more nutritious food systems,
more diversified
and productive energy systems,
low methane is itself the co-benefit
of that better developmental pathway,
and that is good for planet,
but it is also fundamentally
good for people.
And hopefully that's something
that you all can also get behind.
Thank you.
(Applause)",,
xGJe_eRw2Ao,"What is home? Lately, I've been thinking
about that question a lot because home
isn't just a place with familiar spots
and corners. It It's where you feel a
sense of belonging. And as the world has
gotten bigger and messier and lonelier,
I have been feeling like it is more
urgent than ever to have people and
places that I can depend on, to really
call a place home. When I brought this
up to my friend, the poet and educator
Sarah Kay, she said,
>> ""We have to go to Columbus, Ohio, and
hang out with my friend Hanife Abdurke.
No one is a better person to show us
what it means to be from a place, to
love that place, and to love the people
in it.""
>> So, today we are hanging out with Hanife
Abdurk and learning about why he loves
his hometown so much.
Hanife Abdurakib wears many hats, but I
know him first as a poet and a writer. A
cultural critic who writes about music
in a way that makes you just want to
listen to albums all day long. An
essaist whose books about grief and joy
and basketball make you ugly cry in
public.
Every time I think I'm going to dodge it
and then he gets me again, I am tearing
up.
Hanife spends a lot of time on the road,
but he always returns to the place where
he is from, the east side of Columbus,
Ohio. And that is not just a place that
Hanife loves. It is clearly a place that
loves Hanife right back.
I've been thinking a lot about the idea
of like when the world is really
overwhelming and there's so much going
on, how one of the ways that we can
ground ourselves is like to be in a
specific place, to be in a community and
with people we care about, taking care
of them and having them take care of us.
You know, we're filming this and
recording this in June. It's like a
massive heat wave that has scripped the
city. And last night, my neighborhood
lost power. Like my street lost power.
And it's a funny thing happens when you
lose power, at least for me, where I had
like 10 solid mids being like maybe this
is just affecting me.
>> But I like gradually like peeked out my
window and saw one of my neighbors
gathering in the in a gazebo in the
middle of our street. So it was
wonderful in a sense to go out to this
gathering point and have everyone kind
of like we all don't have power. What
are the most immediate needs? If I were
to say I am just like a small speck in
this this grand universe, I would very
easily and quickly fall into this
individualism. Instead of me saying well
I step outside of my house and I see
either a person or I see the results of
a person's living reflected directly to
me. Why do you love Columbus so much?
>> I tend to think that my most joyful
experiences living in Columbus are
mirrored by the fact that people just
talk to me in a way that is also
familiar and comfortable.
We're in Spoonful Records in Columbus,
Ohio. It's my favorite record shop and
Columbus is a great record town. In
every city I would stop on tour, I would
go digging. I would go record shopping,
but it's kind of isolating. I know my
own taste. Left to my own devices, I
would just be delving through the crates
in search of whatever would satiate and
satisfy my own taste. It requires
someone, be it a friend you bring to the
shop with you or a person behind the
counter like Brett or Amy or Elijah here
at Spoonful, who can say, ""I remember we
had this talk about sliced stone. I got
these sliced stone bides. You want to
hear it?""
>> That's so cool.
>> Yeah. Amy drew
>> Amy drew this. Yeah. Yeah.
>> Just the people who know you with a
depth of curiosity and care. Thanks as
always, y'all. Yeah. Telling me I say
what's up
>> and email. Definitely email me stuff
you're working on. Hit me up. I think if
I offer myself up freely and eagerly to
others, it informs our collective, our
shared interest in each other so that
when we come across something that we
think might delight the other person, we
hold on to it for a while until they
reenter our lives again. And that is
beautiful to me. And I think that has
really mapped itself out through my life
in Columbus.
The idea of offering yourself up to
people freely and eagerly, that really
stuck with me. You know, as kids, we're
told not to talk to strangers. But to
Hanife, no one in this town was a
stranger, even if he had never met them
before.
>> Bye.
>> Thank you.
>> After Spoonful Records, Haneife took us
to see some of his other favorite
Columbus spots.
>> My favorite thing is to be in the car
with Haneife driving around Columbus,
Ohio. Do you have like a go-to when a
friend comes to Columbus of like what do
you show them?
>> Buckeye Donuts is uh one of my favorite
places in the world. The Buckeye like
glazed donut with chocolate frosting and
then a peanut butter center. Um it is a
phenomenal experience.
There's like an assortment of like cake
donuts and jelly filled things.
>> What's up, brother? How you
>> good, brother? Good to see you.
>> Yeah. Take a take a donut.
I'm a big sneaker guy and when I was
coming up, sneaker boutiques were not as
popular. Now there's sneaker boutiques
everywhere and Heat Archive is
interesting because they're local guys.
>> You have so many incredible shoes.
What's the most Columbus sneaker you
have in the store?
>> Most Columbus sneaker.
>> Like if you could sum up the city in
one.
>> Definitely these Scarlet and Gray. These
would take it every time.
They're so caring and thoughtful for our
young folks and they don't really talk
about all that much, but like if kids
come in with a good report card, they'll
give him a pair of sneakers for free. Or
if a kid comes in and doesn't have
enough money for the pair that he wants,
they'll like take care of them. It feels
like as much of a community hub as a
sneaker shop can be. This is what we
love to do, like have a big passion for
it. So, bringing this here like growing
up was like our dream.
I am someone who I grew up born and
raised in New York City and I left. I
moved somewhere else. You have such a
deep connection to Ohio. You were raised
here. You still live here. What do you
think makes some people leave their
hometowns and some people stay?
>> And I think the relationship with one's
place of origin is by definition, I
think, a contentious one because you
don't choose it. Place is something that
happens to you. What keeps me here? I
guess I can't speak to why people leave,
but there is one woman on a street in
East Columbus who
has held on to her house no matter what.
She's been offered so much money, been
offered so much to move out of that
house cuz if she moves out of that
house, it is the entry point to kind of
raise that neighborhood and make it
something else. And she refuses to
leave. and her refusal
I think is an action that the my work is
pointing towards.
My very presence is stopping the worst
designs of a city that has no idea who
its population actually is. And my
staying here means I'm actually keeping
a history that existed before me and a
history that I want to exist after me.
Cuz what's the point of staying in a
neighborhood if the neighborhood no
longer feels like it's a place where
you're welcome or if you cannot be
translated through the new population of
that neighborhood.
I love the Park of Roses because it is
exactly what it sounds like. And Park of
Roses were like where you took if you
had no money uh but you wanted to go on
a date and if it was like spring, that's
where you would go on a date cuz it's
like we could just look at these pretty
flowers and don't worry about the fact
that we're both broke.
Okay. So, you're both poets and I feel
like poets and flowers, right? This is
the stereotypical relationship that
you're supposed to have.
>> What are you trying to say, Chris?
>> Roses are red, violets are blue. I'm
with two poets. Do what you do.
>> And there's the poetry.
>> Poetry. Oh, there's a flower named
poetry.
>> Yeah.
>> When you are walking around a place like
this that's full of natural beauty,
is this like ripe possibility for poetic
inspiration or do you is that not how it
works for you?
>> For me, it doesn't work that way. Like I
don't look at that bush of flowers and
say I'm going to write a poem about that
bush of flowers. I I think that's maybe
not my brand of brain function. I think
what is more useful to me is to like
find out the history of the flower and
what it might tell me about the land it
originally came from
>> or there's something beyond the surface
thing that my brain is consuming. And I
think just because something is
beautiful doesn't mean that it has to be
reworked into something else beyond what
it's already offering us. I tend to just
kind of think that this is a cool place
to sit in gratitude. Like we're here,
we're here in late July in the middle of
the heat wave and yet these flowers have
survived a little bit longer than they
normally would. You know
>> what is it like gilding a lily, right?
Literally that is about a flower because
it's like when something is already
beautiful in the form that it's in, it
doesn't need your messy human poetry
trapesing about. Speaking of which, as
much as we wanted to stay and smell the
roses, there was a poetry reading that
we had to catch.
Funny enough, it wasn't actually a
reading for Hanife, but one that he had
put together for Sarah, whose book had
just come out, which really hit
something home for me. Like Hanife said,
place may be something that happens to
you, but community, that's something you
build with care and generosity.
Thank you all for coming out tonight.
It's great to be in here and not be
expected to do anything other than
introduce poets that I want to hear.
Yesterday Sarah got into Columbus and we
were driving around and she was looking
up at the sky and she was like, ""Look at
like how round and like beautiful the
clouds are.
Like the the edges of the clouds are so
puffy and round."" And you know, as
someone who lives here, I was kind of
like, ""Oh, yeah, sure, sure."" And the
whole function of this was like Sarah
lives in New York. And so like the
clouds are often obscured by the skyline
is the show and the sky is not as much
the show. I think that often times the
function of the entire project of Sarah
K's Living, if I could boil it down to
one thing is look at this thing, look at
this thing, look at this thing, but not
in an annoying way. It is a way that
says, ""I am checking to see if your
heart's still working."" and your ability
to pay close attention to that which you
have become intimately and deeply
familiar with. Because if you can pay
deep and close attention to the clouds
that you walk underneath like literally
every day in this city, you might be
able to pay close attention to someone
in your life who may be hurting or in
need of something or deeply just need
you to sit in front of them and be
silent for a while. And so I am thankful
to be uh a fan of Sarah's work, but more
than that, I am thankful to have a life
where Sarah is always challenging me to
question repeatedly how well is my heart
still working. Please give her a hand.
OKAY.
It's not very charitable to make someone
cry before they go on stage.
Um, hi $2 radio. Hi Columbus.
Woo!
>> Gosh, you look good.
>> As I sat and listened to some beautiful
poetry with this lovely group of people,
I realized that building a community
doesn't have to be this big intimidating
thing. It can start small. It reminded
me of something that Hanife said
earlier. How do you decide who is in
your circle of care and who is not? So,
I was unhoused for a stretch. I was like
sleeping in a storage unit for a while
and then just like very much on the
streets, right? There's this very large
church and
every morning
I would walk by it and there was a
person who, you know, was like a
maintenance person at the church who
would notice me. And after a while,
again, without a lot of language or a
lot of intention, he would start
unlocking the door at 6:00 a.m., you
know, and let me and a couple other
people come in and sleep in the pews for
3 hours. It was saying like, I have a
key. The key opens a door inside on the
other side of the door is a place where
you'll be safe for 3 hours. And so I
tend to think that for me, I've been
lucky enough in my life where I feel
like I've been in community with elders
and younger folks and I've also been in
of course like just a broad swath of
people who I'm in community with. And
often times it does not feel like to
give of myself in a way that serves or
feeds others is that difficult or
challenging. It feels instead like this
very simple thing of I have a key to
something. I'm going to unlock something
and we are going to sit in a place that
feels comfortable and safe for us for as
long as it takes. And in some ways the
miracle is to say I will surrender my
time to you. And through the
surrendering of my time I hope to love
you better. And I also hope to be
renewed in a way that helps me love
others better. Because if I move through
the world with a very clear
understanding of the fact that my time
is not only my own, then I think I make
the most of it in the moments where it
is my own.
Hey, thanks so much for watching this
video. If you like what you saw, you
should check out our podcast, How to be
a better human. We have extended
conversations with both Sarah Kay and
Hanife Abdurakib that are coming out on
the podcast. you can hear a lot more of
their insights and thoughts and poetry.
And we also have conversations with all

_V6C0SFEUO8,"So what if your child had the heart,
the drive, the skill
for something they love,
but not the access?
What if a sport your child loved ...
denied her the ability to play
because of her gender?
Let's imagine your granddaughter,
your sister, your niece.
Let's imagine a world
where she had every opportunity
that exists for a young boy.
Where the playing field
wasn't just metaphorically level,
it was literally accessible to her.
Let's think about ...
A world where every locker room door
opened with the same ease for everyone.
That question
has stayed with me for years
and is really the reason
why I'm standing here today.
I played in the NFL for 15 years,
was an all-star,
and now serve as executive vice president
of football operations for the NFL.
I think about my journey
and this journey of sport and football.
I was raised by a strong woman,
Alma Vincent,
this quiet determination
and women surrounded my life
throughout my childhood.
That brings me back to a young girl
in the city of Trenton, New Jersey,
named Tracy Williams.
Now, Tracy not only played every sport,
Tracy competed,
Tracy was smart, Tracy was fast.
Tracy not only competed,
Tracy used to whoop our tails.
(Laughter)
But as time went on,
there was no coach or recruiter
in the neighborhood recruiting Tracy.
There was no place for girls,
as what we would call,
on the football playing field.
So as time went on, she dreamed,
but her access quickly vanished.
Today, a father of five,
not so young kids anymore.
Five different dreams,
five different personalities.
Five different aspirations
and five levels of complete drama.
(Laughter)
I have had my fair share
of carpools and sport practices.
Our oldest child, Desiré,
our oldest daughter,
our beautiful daughter, Desiré,
has always had this hunger
and this competitiveness about her,
could throw a pretty good spiral
by the time Des was seven.
Des was smart, Desiré was agile.
Many would consider her slightly tough.
Desiré played a ton
of football in the backyards
with her brother and friends.
By the time Desiré turned ten,
the opportunity to keep playing
quickly vanished.
It wasn’t because Desiré lost interest.
Desiré lost access.
Meanwhile,
her brothers, our sons,
they had the opportunity
to continue to play,
at both the high school level
and the collegiate level.
I realized that I was giving my sons
or teaching my sons,
life lessons of toughness, building grit,
telling them not to cry.
And quickly,
I realized that I was just reinforcing
this thing called the man box,
where I was teaching my sons one thing,
but then, yet reinforcing
that boys get to compete
and girls get to cheer.
It was at that time I realized
that the system was broken.
Fast forward 30 years,
flag football has truly emerged
as this dynamic, all-inclusive sport.
Today ...
It is not only creating options
for young women,
it is being played by 20 million people
across 100 different countries.
This flag movement is real.
It is creating options for young women
that never existed before.
Flag football teachers,
as we would consider, these life skills
that football has always taught.
They just haven't been shared
with young girls.
Of leadership, resiliency, toughness.
It develops grit.
Now young women, young girls
have an opportunity to compete.
Now you may be asking yourself,
why this movement?
Why all of a sudden this explosion?
It's affordable,
it's accessible.
It's all-inclusive.
And I'll add one more point there.
It's social-media friendly.
Seventeen states
have sanctioned girls’ varsity flag
as a true varsity sport in high school.
Nineteen additional states
have pilot programs.
One hundred-plus colleges now offer
flag with scholarships.
Let's take
Ki'Lolo Westerlund.
I love this, I just I love this image.
Why?
She's the first female
to earn a Division-one
full scholarship for flag football.
(Applause)
She's the first of many.
That's just the beginning.
And this is what excites me.
In 2028,
flag football will debut
in the Los Angeles Olympic Games.
OK, there's been 100 years --
(Applause)
But let's think about this.
A hundred-plus years of football
and our young ladies
will be able to represent,
will take the field in a sport
that once had no place for them.
We're not in the Olympic Games
if not for the participation
and the skill level of young
women across the globe.
NFL flag, we're now
in six different continents.
Flag is truly becoming a global language.
It is truly taking the world by storm.
And it's taking the world by storm
because of the participation of women.
Women are driving this movement.
I won't allow anyone to say,
well, it's because of marketing.
No it's not. It's simple.
We opened the door for her
and we gave her
an opportunity to participate,
and she's taken our sport
to another level.
It is so important that this movement,
that we nurture it
in this time and this space.
We must nurture this movement.
What do I mean by nurturing the movement?
Let's take advantage of this momentum.
The one thing that we
have to be careful of,
and this is why I'll challenge
the group here.
It is so important that we don't
commercialize it for men or boys,
because there's a tendency to do that,
to commercialize the sport
and create a commercial model for boys.
And then yet we get satisfied
with just access for women.
No.
We must create a equal playing field
as we develop this great sport.
It is so important that we nurture it.
So you may be asking, well, what can I do?
Ask the question at your schools.
Start small.
Reach out to your local parks and rec.
Are you offering,
do young women have the ability
to play flag football
at your school,
at your local parks and rec?
What this does for young ladies,
I think about, we talk about life skills.
Life skills and football
are so transferable.
We need to remind,
just like we remind our young boys,
these transferable skills
that I live by every single day.
Leadership, toughness,
communication skills,
these are all transferable life skills.
Read the defense, read a room.
Call an audible, solve a problem.
Lead a drive, lead in life.
These are things that we've
been telling our young boys
and what the game provides us
as a transferable life skill
for over 100 years.
They're now on the table
as an option for young ladies.
If we can, can we just run the video?
(Video)
Person 1: I feel that right now
we are living an amazing moment in time
for women in sports.
Person 2: Flag football makes you
feel powerful and strong and fearless.
Person 3: To see what women can do
in this sport is pretty amazing.
Person 4: Bring your teammates
back up with you, let's go.
Person 5: I see her dedication
and her love for the game.
Person 6: The self-confidence
this sport gave them is immeasurable.
Person 7: It's made her
such a strong person.
Person 8: For many years,
we've heard so many no's.
No, you can't play.
No, you're just a woman.
No, you're never going
to be as fast as man.
We belong on the football field now.
It's an Olympic sport.
We're going there.
It's our sport.
It's our time.
We're going to the Olympics.
[Our sport]
[Our time]
[To make history]
(Applause)
So in closing,
my challenge to the audience,
to the group, to the world.
Let's just imagine a world where
Tracy from my old neighborhood,
my granddaughters Laila, Rosie,
Nadia, Giani,
imagine a world
where they can take the field.
Imagine a world where your niece,
your sister, your daughter
is representing our country.
Imagine a world where
your niece, your daughter,
your granddaughter ...
Is walking out in the opening ceremony.
Here's my challenge
and here's what I would leave.
Let her lead.
Let her dream.
Just let her take the field.
Why?
Because the future of football and sports
it is through women.
And it's now.
Thank you.

3913fIgBFhs,"So the far right is on the rise
everywhere in Europe.
Now, this is different from a while ago.
Just until recently,
I used to use Spain or Portugal
as examples of of countries
that didn't have the far right
as a significant force.
And the problem is not just that these
parties are getting a lot of votes.
The problem is that many of these
parties are now in government.
Look at Italy for example,
look at Hungary,
look at countries in Scandinavia.
Or when they're not in government,
they are actual contenders for it.
I don't want to think about the next
French presidential election,
or many other countries
where these parties
are significantly contending for power.
Now, why is that?
And why do other parties,
more importantly,
think that in order
to defeat the far right,
they need to copy the far right?
They need to become the far right?
Well, that is because we hear a story,
wherever we look at why this is happening,
the story we hear is that, well,
you know, it's all about immigration.
It's all about culture.
It's all about people now
not wanting globalization,
not wanting immigrants,
not wanting transnationalism,
people just wanting nationalist politics.
And all the parties are doing
is that they are responding
to this kind of popular demand,
as we call it in academia,
and therefore the far right
is on the rise.
And what I want to do is debunk this myth
and sort of disagree with this
and say, this is not
a simple story at all,
and it's not a story
only about immigration.
And it's not a story only about culture.
Actually, what it is,
is on, what we call in academia,
the demand side or the people
or the insecurities
that drive people to vote
for particular parties
are multiple and extend
way beyond culture.
They extend way beyond immigration.
But on the supply, or in other words,
the parties themselves,
they are adopting very clever
nationalist narratives
that are really able
to capture this very,
very broad coalition of voters.
So, let me start by actually
showing some of this.
This is just some data.
I'm an academic, as I said, and so I love
to talk with data and with evidence.
And this is just a very, very simple graph
that shows what the voters
of far-right parties across
different European countries look like,
or what their preferences are.
And the one key thing
that I take away from that
is that there is a non-immigration route
to far-right voting.
This shows you that one third
of far-right voters in Europe
don't report immigration concerns at all.
It also shows you that in many countries
where voters do have immigration concerns,
these are economic.
In other words, these people
have become susceptible
to narratives that say
that immigrants take away jobs,
they take away access to the labor market,
they take away access to social services.
So what I am arguing is that while
focusing on immigration is one,
perhaps, one driver
of far-right party support,
for these parties to gain the percentages
that we are seeing now,
the 20 percent and the 30 percent
and the 40 percent,
we need to look way beyond immigration
to see the other insecurities
that drive them.
And this is my visualization
of the successful far right
versus a non-successful far right.
And really what it shows you here
is that voters with cultural concerns,
I call them the culturalists,
they are definitely going
to vote for the far right.
But actually they are a very
small part of the electorate.
The voters that allow the parties
to extend well beyond their voter base
are people I call the materialists,
i.e. people who have been convinced
that the immigrants take away jobs
and access to the labor market, etc.,
they are the welfarists.
I've done a lot of research
on how social policies
actually limit the propensity.
They moderate, they compensate
insecure people,
thus limiting their propensity
to vote for the far right.
They are the distrustful.
We have so much data about
people losing trust in institutions
and political and social institutions,
in the parliament,
in the government, in the state
to deliver on its social
contract obligations.
And the anti-greens.
There is a new, big cleavage
emerging across Europe.
Those people who don't want
to pay more for the environment,
who are actually voting for the far right
because they believe that they
are being hurt by environmental policies.
These people are living particularly
in rural areas of Europe,
where they can't afford to say,
give up their car and, I don't know,
buy a new one that has no emissions
or buy more environmentally-friendly ...
Environmentally-friendly
cars or vehicles, etc.
So with these, I call
these the peripheral voters.
It is capturing these voters
that allows far-right parties
to extend well beyond
their secure voting base
and get people to vote for them.
How do they do that?
This is the key of what I'm arguing
because, you know, do you know any society
that doesn't have insecure people?
There is no society
that has no insecure people.
There is always going to be people
who are worried about their
economic situation,
they're worried about their
status in society.
But these may or may not
be captured by voters,
depending on what the parties do.
So parties have power to shape
their own electoral fortunes.
How are the far-right parties
in Europe doing this?
Well, they are putting forward
what I call civic nationalist narratives.
Or in other words,
they are sort of shifting the boundaries
of toleration on its head.
These parties are no longer
saying ""I'm extreme,
and I don't want people
who are biologically different to me.""
Because you know who's going
to vote for a party that is openly racist?
No, what they say is, ""We exclude those
who do not espouse our liberal
democratic values.
We exclude those who don't
espouse our liberal democracies.""
They are antithetical to the very essence
of the democracies
that Europe is based on.
I've got some really
interesting campaigns.
The AfD campaign,
the AfD was recently called
an extreme party in Germany.
Yet it's saying,
""No, we're not extreme.""
It had this bikini campaign
a few years ago
when it was competing for elections
saying, ""Well, you know what?
We just don't want these others,
who come in with their intolerant ideas
and tell us we can't
wear bikinis on the beach.
We can't, you know, drink our wine
and we can't eat our pork
because we are liberal democratic party
and we just don't want to include those
who ideologically exclude us.""
Now, this is a very, very clever strategy
because this makes
parties appear more moderate.
It takes away the stigma of fascism.
It takes away the stigma of extremism.
So a voter will say, well, ""It's OK,
I can vote for these people
because they are not actually extreme.""
But unfortunately,
these parties are extreme.
And we see that these parties are extreme
as they increasingly enter government
and they increasingly attack
liberal democratic institutions.
So what am I saying here, just to finish?
I'm saying that if it was simply a story
about society changing,
society no longer being divided
simply by haves and have nots,
but divided on a transnational cleavage,
then we could tackle immigration
and that would be it.
But this is not what is going on.
This is not at all.
Other parties copying
the far right on immigration
are only making this problem worse.
They are only normalizing the far right
and making the far right bigger,
because the problem is not a problem
necessarily that comes from the demand.
It's a problem of supply.
But what I'm saying
is actually a good thing.
It's a positive thing
because it means, if I am right,
then this means that parties have agency.
And if the far right
has the agency to capture
broader and broader coalitions,
that's a bad thing.
But it means that we also have agency
to put on our own narratives.
Parties that oppose the far right
can also put forward successful narratives
to tackle the far right.
We have agency, and that agency
cannot be to copy the far right.
That agency has to be
to contradict the far right,
to expose it for what it is, extreme,
and to also put forward and promote
the positive aspects of immigration.
(Applause)",,
KIAsBq64hnQ,"My name is César Ramirez-Sarmiento.
I'm based in Santiago, Chile.
I'm a protein engineer and designer.
Proteins are macromolecules
which are composed of amino acids.
They are made of 20
different types of amino acids.
They are represented by letters.
So you can imagine
an alphabet of amino acids,
and you can imagine that these amino acids
are connected to each other
like beads on a string.
And so that allows for them
to come together in different geometries.
And so they get a shape,
they get a three-dimensional structure
that allows for them
to dictate their functions.
We have many different proteins
with many different shapes
that actually perform different
biological functions in cells.
They allow us to digest food,
they allow us to transport ions
for electrical signals
to go through neurons.
They allow for the expression
of different genes
that regulate how our cells
or how our body responds.
Proteins are the workhorse of cells.
They are like a toolbox for cells
to do whatever they have to do.
Proteins have been evolving
for millions of years
for performing functions
that are important for cellular life.
They have been perfected
by nature to do what they do now.
But when it comes to problems
that are important for humankind,
like plastic contamination,
carbon dioxide, problems in health,
we want to make them better.
We just don't have
a thousand years to wait for it.
We have to do it now.
Protein engineering, in short,
it's asking yourself
if you can change the amino acid
composition of your protein.
And by doing so,
if you can get improvements
in some properties of that protein.
We can use different tools for that,
we can use experimental approaches,
we can use computational approaches.
But overall what they're doing
is that they are changing
this sequence of amino acids
that compose proteins
in order to improve these properties.
This is like giving nature a little push.
And that's where the use
of artificial intelligence comes in.
In the last five years, we have seen
breakthroughs in artificial intelligence
for designing proteins
that we never imagined.
They allow us for designing
new protein structures,
new protein shapes
that encode bespoke functions
for solving all types of problems.
Before the advent of AI,
the success rate for protein design
was about one percent or less,
which means if you created 100 proteins
with 100 different sequences,
maybe one of them will work.
Now, with the advent of AI,
we see about 10 to 20 percent.
So if you now take your 100 sequences
that you generated in the computer,
about 20 of them will actually
have the desired activity,
and some of them will be actually better
than the input sequences
of the protein of interest
that you're working with.
When I was a kid, I was interested in arts
because it was allowing
for a space for creativity.
But then when I was in high school,
I opted for science because I saw
that I could provide much more
for the benefit of society
by pursuing science
instead of arts, in my case.
But I think both disciplines
are actually playgrounds for creativity.
For science, artificial
intelligence is another tool
for coming up with creative solutions
for different problems.
My dream future for protein engineering
is that we have a strong community
of protein engineers and designers
in Latin America,
so that we can create
solutions for problems
that are specific to our countries.
We are usually not fully aware
of the advances
of the use of artificial intelligence
for protein engineering and design
that is happening
in other parts of the world.
But at the same time, we have many people
that are interested
in creating new proteins.
And so the idea of working in Chile
is that we can actually create
a critical mass of scientists
that can work on these problems.
We are actually working
on how to educate the next generation
of scientists from Latin America
on how to use these tools.
I always had this belief
that we had to come together
to try to do something bigger
than what we can do as individuals.
We can think about other compositions
of nature that we haven't seen before.
In the case of proteins,
we can navigate untapped terrain
that nature hasn't explored yet.
We can navigate through those landscapes
of different protein structures,
different protein sequences,
and see whether those spaces
that contain these protein
structures and sequences
are actually good for resolving the issues
that are the most pressing
problems for humankind.",,
9j-Gx0ALrrY,"So, if you are feeling stressed today, I
have three quick tips to get you through
your day. The first step is the near and
the far. In order to do this, go ahead
and take your finger and pointing it up
to the sky, bring it all the way to your
nose and try to focus on it. As you
slowly pull that finger away, even
though it looks like two, you want to
continue slowly moving that away from
your face until it's one. And then go
ahead and bring that finger back towards
your nose. And it's going to get kind of
wibbly wobbly, but that's okay because
as we are trying to focus on that, we
are using the power of convergence and
divergence to help calm the amydala,
that fear center in our brain. Next one
is pinch the valley. So in pinch the
valley, we are going to be accessing and
activating our vag nerve to help calm
down that fear center. I'm gonna make an
L with my left hand, with my thumb and
forefinger. I'm going to take my right
hand and make some pincers with my thumb
and forefinger. And I'm gonna just
massage the in between meaty bit in
between that thumb and forefinger. Now,
you don't need to dig in and leave a
bruise, but adding some good pressure.
And this is something that you can do
anywhere, anytime. Then once you're done
on that hand, you can switch it up to
the other hand. This is one of my
absolute favorites because I can do it
under the table. I can do it while
driving or standing in line somewhere.
And the vagus nerve, which is going to
be the longest cranial nerve in the
body, that is going to have a role in
our fight orflight part of our nervous
system. So when that vagus nerve is
activated, that is signaling to our
brain and our body that we can return to
a sense of calm because all is safe. And
last but not least is going to be
tapping into courage. I'm going to take
my two index fingers and just start
right between the eyebrows. And with
some gentle pressure, I'm going to draw
a heart starting at that forehead piece
and moving around my eyes down under my
cheekbones and to my chin. And then if
you're feeling crazy, jumping over your
throat and tapping your way towards your
shoulders. Now, you can do this many
times as you are trying to get a little
bit of extra courage before that meeting
as you're hiding in the bathroom or
maybe you're in the car um trying to
navigate through some stressful traffic.
So, the next time that you're feeling
stressed, try one of these and come
back. Let us know in the comments if it
worked for",,
9o1HPx__P9w,"All right, first question. We ready?
Good morning, everyone. Morning. It's
great to be in this hall. It's about the
size of Delaware. What can what can
Democratic and Republican governors do
together to restore trust in government?
Well, thank you for that. Um, you know,
I think first off that trust in the
federal government, uh, our founding
fathers never envisioned the federal
government to dominate every single part
of our lives. They thought about this
idea of federalism, that the states are
closer to the people. Uh, that the
states know how to educate our kids. We
we we're focused on education. We're
focused on infrastructure. We're focused
on the economy and healthcare. And when
you have a one-sizefits-all,
it is a problem. And so we know that
Delaware is different than Oklahoma. Our
founding fathers knew that New Hampshire
was different than Virginia. And I think
if we get back to states rights and
having the states, this 50 laboratories
of democracy, I think we're going to be
much better off than a top-down
approach. Other countries were a little
bit different where the federal
government created these subdivisions,
but it wasn't that way in the US. The
states created the federal government.
Congress has about a 15% approval rating
right now and states are where it's at.
That's where the ideas, the innovation
comes. I think the more we get back to
that, I think the people are happier.
You know, Delaware, I know Oklahoma.
That's right, Kevin. Uh,
states, right? So, 10 years ago, I was a
sixth and seventh grade math teacher.
Uh, and I ended up running for teachers
in the crowd.
not not enough of us go into go into
these uh go into this business politics
and I ran for office. I ran for county
office and it's I'm a pretty progressive
Democrat and I realized pretty quickly
the MAGA Republicans, the Bernie
Democrats and pretty much everyone in
between would support me if I kept
sewage out of their basement and kept
their sewer fees low. If we answer 911
calls quickly, police qualified,
well-trained with with a sense of the
community they're serving showed up
quickly at people's door. I think the
way we restore trust in government is we
deliver for people. If you if you go to
50 governments,
if you go to 50 governors across this
country, Democrat, Republican, the bulk
of our budget is four things. It's
education, it's medication, it's
transportation, and it's incarceration.
And I assure you, if all 50 of of us can
do those four things with excellence,
deliver, and maybe reduce your tax bill
a little bit so that it's affordable, I
think we will get support and we will
win back the American people. That's the
way we win the trust of our people.
Good.
Okay. Second question. Even information
is now polarized. How do you govern when
people may not share our reality or your
reality?
>> Wow. You give me the easy ones. Okay.
You make me start on this one, huh? Um,
my wife is an emergency room physician
and we often joke that when someone
comes into her emergency room, there is
no alternative reality. If someone
cannot breathe and the data shows
someone cannot breathe, she doesn't have
a nurse or she doesn't say, ""Hey, you
you're breathing, right? There's a
reality. Someone can't show a Tik Tok
video to say, ""Oh, your foot is not
falling off."" If it's actually falling
off, I wish that that same sense of data
and truth that she has in her emergency
room, I had in my world. I wish that we
looked at the data on vaccines, for
example, and use that, it's black and
white, and use that to make policy for
our country. I wish we lived in a world
where one social media influencer can't
change the course of what data actually
says. Uh, I think one thing that we both
get a palpable sense of is how many
Americans today are in echo chambers.
They watch the same TV station, hear the
same thing that gives them a pat on the
back and reassures them. We need to do
everything we can to to break those
patterns. It's going to be hard for us
to build a democracy together without
that.
>> Yeah. Very good. Well, you know, and and
I think the the reality is we don't all
think the same, right? Delaware, like I
said before, is different than than than
our state. And I want I think we all
should ask ourselves this question as
Americans. Uh because there's people
watching this, there's probably people
in this room that hate me just because
I'm a Republican. There's people
watching this that hate Matt just
because he's a Democrat. that we're
polarized, that we're driven to our
corners by social media and the media.
And I know Matt. I know his wife Lauren.
He has three children.
>> We're I'm halfway to Kevin Stit. He's
got six.
>> That's right.
>> You're not done yet.
>> Don't tell my wife. Yeah.
we just went to Switzerland together to
study education and their model there
and bring back these ideas about uh
workplace uh workforce learning and and
apprenticeships and um but the thing is
I know that he cares about Delaware
citizens and I know he cares
passionately about education and giving
people in Delaware a better life just
like I do in Oklahoma. So I think that
uh it's not our job to change
everybody's point of view. I think we
need to lead and we need to ask
ourselves this question and we need to
not just be so driven by polarized
politics and and when you bring the
humanity out in each other and when you
spend time with people that think
differently and this idea that we can
debate policy and we can still like each
other and we may have a difference of
opinion on how to how to lead things. Um
it's so refreshing and that's why we
love doing these type of things
together. uh showing that there's a
Republican and a Democrat that actually
like each other and we can disagree but
we don't have to do it disagreeable.
That's right.
>> All right, Kevin, what's something your
state has done that other states can
learn from?
>> Yeah, you know, I I think it's very
topical right now with the government
shutdown and SNAP benefits uh are really
affecting all of our states. I know
governors, we've been on the phone,
we've talked, what are you doing? How
are we going to meet the needs of the
most vulnerable in our state? And so we
set up and really I did this back in
2019 when I was first elected, but I put
up a be a neighbor be a neighbor.org
because I don't believe that you can
pass a law in Washington DC or Oklahoma
City that can fix some of these social
issues. It takes neighbors walking with
neighbors. It takes churches and
nonprofits. And so our be a neighbor
concept is if you have a need, you can
go to this uh website that we've set up
and it connects all of the nonprofits,
the church communities, the state
resources. And so that's something that
I'm really proud of. Also uh behind the
we get a little wonky on policy behind
the meter. this idea that we need to win
uh the energy race that we passed in
Oklahoma, the fiscal responsibility that
that uh that we've done as as coming
from a business world that I brought to
uh state government. I believe that our
job as governors is is to be the CEO of
our state. Uh I've got a $40 billion
budget, 30,000 state employees. I just
want to deliver better services for
Oklahomaans. And uh and I think that
sometimes we elect people that that
don't have that focus. They're more
playing politics and actually delivering
for the people. And you said that great
while ago, too.
>> Yeah. No. So, that's great. I I I know
in Oklahoma I know in Oklahoma there are
a lot of a lot of Tallaladega Knight
fans. And uh you know, I'm a big fan of
There are in Delaware, too. I'm a big
fan of Ricky Bobby who says
>> I love Ricky Bobby. Yeah.
>> Who says if you're not first, you're
last. I happen to be from the first
state. So, just want to put that out.
And we're we're what we're trying to do
what we're trying to do on a serious
note is we're trying to uh put
affordability at the center of
everything we do. What's happening I
believe now in today's economy is you
have billionaires with greater
opportunity to build their wealth than
working people who are getting squeezed
by public schools that don't seem to be
working by energy prices that are
skyrocketing by health care that seems
saddled with 20th century problems and
and costs that seem to have no end. So
we have an affordability agenda. We're
working on building a medical school so
that the medical providers will be
available in our state. There's never
been a medical school in our state.
We're working on we're working on
streamlining permitting something on in
which I think we agree. Getting rid of
what what the former president someone I
like called bureaucratic malarkey,
right? Getting rid of all all the
friction that prevents us from building
the housing that our people desperately
need to bring down rents. Uh, and we're
working on building new energy sources,
something that desperately needed for
our economy and so people can afford
their power bills.
>> Excellent.
If you could fix one aspect of American
political culture, what would that be?
One,
uh, 15 years ago, I was a diplomat. I
was a US diplomat embedded with the army
for 12 months in Mosul, Iraq. lived. I
wasn't a soldier, but I lived on a base
with 10,000 soldiers during Operation
Iraqi Freedom. And what was amazing is
there were soldiers on that base from
every corner of America. As I went to
Iraq, I thought I was going to learn
about Iraq and and Arab culture, which I
did, but I learned a lot I learned a lot
more about America. And there was a team
there. I left the base two or three
times a week to go and meet with Iraqis
to build a lasting peace. And we weren't
always on the same page with the Iraqis
we were meeting with, but the American
team was a singular team. I often wonder
in Delaware, how come when we're talking
about housing or healthcare, education,
we're talking about growing our economy,
there are incredible divisions. How do
we build that same sense of teamwork? Uh
we're in the midst of the greatest human
experiment and self-government that's
ever occurred. We're in almost year 250
of this experiment. I think we need to
find a way as Americans to sit on stage
together to to break bread with each
other to understand that we can't just
channel all of our energies into
knocking each other down. There are
opportunities to be made in Oklahoma and
in Delaware that people will realize if
we do find a way to work together. Good.
Good.
You know what? The one thing I would
change, Governor, is is just inject more
integrity into politics. And what I mean
by that,
you know, to me, integrity is is doing
what's right just because it's right,
even when it's costly. And and I think
politicians especially, that's why
people hate politicians is because they
can see right through them. They're not
doing what's right. out there blindly
following uh some uh you know teams.
It's either your skins or shirts. You're
Democrat, you're Republican, and and uh
and and you blindly are following
things. Let's call a spade a spade. And
let's not be driven to the corners. Most
of America, you've got 10% on the far
right, 10% on the far left. But most
Americans are right there and they're
taking their kids to piano lessons and
soccer practice. They want the best life
for their for their for their kids. They
want the best education, the best health
care system. And so I think the more
that we can talk like this, that we can
come together uh as Americans and stop
being so polarized and really debate the
ideas, I think the better off we'll be.
Um I also uh I'm a huge fan of of
President Lincoln and and at the end of
Civil War, uh it was almost over and and
he was doing his second inaugural
address and he talks about a malice
towards none and and and a charity for
all. And there was people that wanted
to, you know, punish the other side. And
and much like we are today, we've got a
pendulum swinging from one side to
another depending on who's in office.
And we've got to stop that. Uh I don't
think Americans like it. Uh you can't
weaponize the Department of Justice. You
can't cancel uh business deals based on
politics one side or the other. We've
got to allow Americans to innovate and
meet the needs of Americans. Right.
So, next question. Uh, with AI's
influence on education, what happens to
the neighborhood public schools? You
know, it's interesting. I it it's been
said that the one thing Democrats and
Republicans can agree on is social media
needs to get out of the classroom. We
need kids off social media. Uh, my first
year teaching, I was in a program called
Teach for America in Washington DC.
TFA in the house and I had uh we had no
computers in our school teach in the
Anacostia section of Washington DC. Uh
and so we went on a mission to go talk
to businesses nearby universities get
any computers we can but by within a few
months we had two three computers in
every classroom. We plugged them into
the wall and saw kids faces light up as
we brought something called the
worldwide web where they suddenly had
opportunities to explore and learn
outside the walls of our school like
never ever before. I think AI similarly
presents incredible opportunities. Uh I
think we can eliminate standardized
testing in our school. If you look at
the tools that AI has, we have better,
more thorough assessments of students on
a day-to-day basis using modern
technology than would otherwise. One of
the biggest problems I had as a sixth
grade math teachers is some students
walked in with fourth grade, fifth grade
skills and other students walked in with
seventh grade, eighth grade skills.
Using technology, we can deliver
education like never before that's
relevant. But there are threats. We need
to make sure we control the technology
and the technology doesn't control us.
And most importantly, it's not driven by
trillion dollar companies. What our kids
need that our kids, families, and
teachers drive what the needs are. So
good.
So good. You know, one of the one of the
technologies that we're trying to
implement in uh in schools in Oklahoma.
And back to your point, what amazed me
is is I I I observed a sixth grade
teacher uh teaching their class, but
this sixth grade student wasn't reading
at grade level and was way behind. And I
was like,""Wh are you teaching? Why are
you continuing to give this kid sixth
grade material?"" And she's like, ""Well,
I'm a sixth grade teacher. What am I
supposed to do?"" And with AI, we can go
back and teach first grade phonics to
that kid or second grade and we can
bring them up to grade level. We can use
technology to benefit uh the the our
students and get them and help and be a
tool for our teachers. So, we're
embracing it. I think we need to embrace
it. um on workforce and education. I
think that uh the the thing that we need
to think about is get businesses more
involved. We just got back from
Switzerland
>> and this idea in Switzerland that
compulsory education ends in nth grade
and then every single kid like signs a
contract. It was amazing for us to see
they sign a contract and they actually
start going to work because they think
workplace education is education. And so
these kids, it's permeability. They can
also go work. they get a accreditation,
but then they can go on to college if
they want to. And so it's not a dead end
like we think of it here in the US that
oh, if you're going to a vocational
school, you've got a you're a dead-end
person, right? We want them all going to
college. It's not that way in Germany,
Switzerland. And I think we need to
reinvent ourselves.
>> And they were making money, too.
>> It was amazing. The kids were making
a,000 Swiss Franks, which is at 15,
which is, I don't know, 13,400 US. Uh,
but it was a great model and we're
bringing that back to Oklahoma and
Delaware to get more kids more engaged
in the workforce.
>> That's right.
>> All right, last one. Kevin, what gives
you hope for American democracy?
>> You know, as the chair, we're both in
the National Governor Association. It's
the bipartisan group of all the
governors. I'm the chair this year. And
my initiative is reigniting the American
dream. And the American dream uh is this
idea that is so unique to our country
and other countries all want to come
here because the idea is that you can be
anything that you set your mind to. It
doesn't matter who your parents are.
Doesn't matter uh if you were rich or
poor through an education system,
through free markets, you can achieve
your American dream. And there's as many
dreams as there are people. And it may
be that you want to coach your
daughter's soccer team or you want to
start a nonprofit or you want to start a
business. Uh whatever it is, you have
the freedom to do that. And as long as
the American dream is alive, I think the
American democracy is worth fighting
for. And we need to fight for that. And
we need to not teach our children that
there's such things as, you know, equal
outcomes for everyone, but we want equal
opportunities to go chase those dreams.
And I just am so passionate about that's
why I think education is so important to
giving those kids those opportunities
and exposed them with what's possible
because God has uniquely
created everybody differently with great
skills and desires and abilities and
given them everybody an individual
ability that we want to help that next
generation find. And and I think that's
the greatness of America is we're
different. Delaware is different than
Oklahoma. Uh but it is worth fighting
for and that's why we're up here
demonstrating that we do get along. We
do like each other and we can lead our
states. Uh maybe a little differently.
Uh but it's still it's still America and
we're still fighting for it.
>> Yeah. I I I call that I call give him a
round of applause for that. I call that
Kevin a a diverse, equitable, and
inclusive America. So don't use the
don't use the initials. Don't make them
don't make them use the initials.
Listen.
I got to be frank. I didn't really come
here to say this, but last Tuesday's
election gave me a little bit of hope
for American democracy.
Um, I think I'm outnumbered in this
room, actually.
Listen, uh, I'm a big Simpsons fan. And
there's one of my favorite episodes of
the Simpsons is when the Simpsons go to
electroshock therapy. You know, if you
feel empathy for the ones you love,
you're going to care for them. And and
they shock each other for a few minutes
till all the power goes down in
Springfield. And I feel like when I look
at Washington, that's a lot of what's
happening right now. The point I wasn't
we weren't sure if we were going to be
able to fly here. Uh maybe with what's
going on, we'll be able to get out no
problem. Our people literally aren't
aren't able to eat or haven't been able
to get SNAP benefits. Um listen, there
is an opportunity here for us as
governors sitting together as human
beings, as Americans. Go and talk to
someone who disagrees with you. Not to
argue with them, but actually to listen
to them, empathize with them, understand
the position that they come from. That's
what I had to do as a teacher. That's
what many Americans do and that's how we
ultimately have hope for the next 250
years of this great experiment in
self-governance. Thank you very much.
Thank you.",,
decHzqG2NX8,"Humans have been using alcohol
for thousands of years.
But when did we understand it soberly?
It wasn't until the 1700s
that scientists first discovered
the formula of alcohol: C2H5OH.
That's alcohol,
finally got its professional
LinkedIn profile called ethanol,
and started working
as an important chemical.
Advances in engineering and business
have since enabled
large-scale production of ethanol,
and today it is a 
114 billion-dollar industry.
We use it in cosmetics,
in fashion, in medicine,
in food and obviously, beverages.
And it's even more relevant today as fuel
and raw material for some
of the low-carbon industries.
So why am I telling you about alcohol?
Because it is a good example
of how science, engineering and business
work together to change the world.
But it actually took ethanol
more than 200 years to do so.
We simply couldn't wait that long
to tackle our climate challenge.
We urgently need to speed up
and scale up low-carbon solutions.
So my name is Xu Hao and I lead
Tencent's climate change initiatives.
We're a major Chinese tech company
with products in social media,
video games and cloud services.
And we also care about climate change.
It's not just limited
to data center efficiency
or sourcing of renewable energy,
as important as that is.
My colleagues and I have been working
to explore how we could contribute
to the acceleration
of low-carbon technology innovations.
That's why we launched CarbonX Program.
And three years in,
we are actually more optimistic than ever.
Why?
Because we felt the right
answer is not so complicated.
We already have lots of innovation
in science, in engineering and business,
and the secret to further
accelerate the process
is also simple: just do them all at once.
Let me further explain.
First, most of the scientific discoveries
needed to decarbonize our economy
have already been made.
Really, today we generate
electricity from solar and wind,
we store energy
using chemistry or physics.
We turn carbon dioxide
into all kinds of chemicals.
And nuclear fusion is also on the horizon.
Alright, 100 years already saved.
Let me give you a specific example.
CRISPR is a genetic scissor
that's well-known
in the pharmaceutical industry.
They use it to edit genetic code
to find cures for diseases and new drugs.
But it can be applied to carbon too.
Take Gasgene, a Chinese startup.
They actually apply CRISPR
to a certain bacteria called Clostridium,
so that these little guys
can actually feed on carbon dioxide
and produce butanol.
So why does butanol matter?
Because together with our old
friend ethanol as well as butanol,
we actually get ethylene glycol,
polyethylene, polypropylene,
butyl acetate,
dibutyl phthalate,
tributyl citrate and many more.
A bit lost, right?
These chemicals are actually
used in paint, clothes,
toys, water bottles, furniture,
and the list goes on and on and on.
Essential to everyday life,
but all made up out of fossil fuel today.
With Clostridium, we could
potentially make all of them
using carbon dioxide instead.
It's really great science.
So it's not the science holding us up.
What about engineering?
Very important, but unglamorous.
Well, engineering requires
lots of innovation, too.
Because we have to replicate a success
in the laboratory test tubes
and scale it up in a much,
much bigger way,
from grams to kilograms
to tons to millions of tons.
Eventually a big factory.
To do that, engineers
often face two challenges.
First, how to build a factory
faster and cheaper.
And then, how to operate it effectively.
Let's say we want to build a plant
that produces 20,000 tons
of clean chemical using carbon dioxide.
Do we build one big reactor
or a few smaller ones?
This is where the process
engineers come in.
How much pressure is needed
in these reactors?
What are the flow rates needed
for the gases or the liquids
so that they are balanced
and the production is most effective?
How much land such a facility will occupy.
How does it integrate
with the existing factory?
And probably most importantly,
how can we build such a plant
faster and cheaper?
Well, all of these considerations
determine the fence, pumps, compressors,
reactors and all the other
parts we will use
and whether we could use
off-the-shelf standardized equipment.
Because otherwise,
if we have to design novel parts,
it will be much more expensive
and often takes much longer.
So this is what engineering
innovation looks like
when it comes to building a big factory.
So it’s almost like picking up
pieces of LEGO blocks
to build a beautiful model
of your own design.
Both creativity and discipline
are needed at the same time.
Then it comes [to] 
operational efficiency.
Feynman Dynamics is another start-up,
they actually combine carbon dioxide
and green hydrogen
to make green hydrocarbons
and produce sustainable
aviation fuel, or SAF
that could potentially
clean up our flights.
So the key is actually a catalyst
that can efficiently convert
carbon dioxide
into carbon monoxide.
And the engineering challenge here
is how to manufacture
such a high-quality catalyst
at much bigger volume.
So the process is almost
like making a fruit smoothie.
You need to blend fruits just right
to get a delicious drink.
But when you try to make
much bigger batches,
sometimes the blender gets too hot
or the fruit doesn't mix well
and that will jeopardize
the taste of our drink.
To tackle this challenge,
engineers at Feynman Dynamics
actually borrowed practice
from pharmaceutical chemistry.
They designed a special
high-speed mixer
that passes the chemicals
at really high velocity in a tube
and then circulates back
the finished product,
back to the main reactor
to make high-quality catalyst.
It's almost like your pre-planned
avocados and apples first,
and then put them back
into the big blender
to get the ultimate drink.
So these rather small engineering steps
actually enabled Feynman Dynamics
to produce their catalysts
at industrial scale.
So today, SAF is still more
than five times more expensive
than conventional jet fuel,
but with lots of innovation like this
and also the production at scale,
I believe SAF can beat jet fuel
in cost within ten years' time.
(Applause)
So the engineers are hard at work,
but what about business?
Because business is all about price,
cost, market and profitability.
And in order to reduce carbon emissions
in the scale of gigatons,
start-ups must turn their science
and engineering innovation
into profitable ventures.
But we got plenty of good news here too.
Some of the technologies are approaching
the moment where they cost the same,
or even less than the fossil
fuel alternative,
sometimes without a carbon price.
Yuanchu is a start-up that makes
calcium carbonate out of carbon dioxide.
So calcium carbonate
may also sound unfamiliar,
but these white powders
are actually in our everyday life,
from paper to toothpaste
to washing powders to car tires.
By using leftover calcium from biomass
or the steelmaking industry,
Yuanchu can actually produce
high-quality calcium carbonate
cheaper than the conventional method,
which is digging limestone
out of the ground
and burning lots
of fossil fuel to make it.
Great green discount, right?
Then sometimes business is all
about the size of the eventual market.
Moguang is another start-up
that actually developed this really
groundbreaking new material
called radioactive cooling.
So this material not only reflects
93 percent of sun radiation back,
it could achieve additional cooling
by radiating the heat back to outer space,
leveraging certain wavelengths’
cooling window.
Guess what requires cooling?
Melting glaciers.
That’s why we launched
a pilot project with Moguang
in Dagu glacier, one of the endangered
glaciers near Tibetan Plateau.
Over the past three years,
the melting has slowed down
by as much as 80 percent.
But --
(Applause)
But the project itself
is actually not a business.
Guess what it is.
Any service that requires cooling.
So that's your mobile phone,
glass wall of a building or data centers.
So the great news is not only Moguang
covered [the] glacier with this material,
they already integrated
many of their material
into hundreds of thousands
of mobile phones and sports cameras
and expanding to other
products very quickly.
So there is truly huge market potential.
Alright, so the science is here,
the engineers are hard at work
and the business models are scaling up.
So our final question is,
can we further accelerate?
Of course we can.
Simply by bringing together scientists,
industry experts and business
people in the same room,
so they start thinking
about all the tough questions
from the very beginning, at the same time.
So the scientists will probably ask
""How much gigajoule of energy is required
to capture one ton of carbon dioxide?""
The industry experts will ask,
""How does your technology
help me decarbonize my industry
and how does it fit into my factory?""
And the investor will probably ask,
""What's your plan to grow your business
by 100 times in the next five years
and to go public?""
This is almost exactly what happened
at CarbonX Program.
Let's just say this productive
dialogue, heated debate,
sometimes really disagreement
can be challenging,
but it really helps speed up the process
because it gets everybody to thinking
about everything at the same time.
Not waiting 200 years like alcohol.
(Laughter)
Now remember Gasgene
and those cute Clostridium.
We recently launched
a clean chemical consortium
that brings consumer brands,
big chemical companies and start-ups
like Gasgene or Yuanchu,
to try to make everything
out of carbon dioxide.
That's also working on science,
engineering and business all at once.
So by now, hopefully you guys understand
why I felt we should [have] every reason
to be really optimistic.
Because we already have
plenty of scientific discovery,
engineering innovation
and business models
so that we should be inspired
to imagine a world
with net zero and cleaner future.
Most likely much better
than what AI can generate for us today.
(Laughter)
Therefore, I'm definitely
drunk on the possibility
of a better and cleaner future.
Cheers, everyone, thank you.

that can't have a solution?
>> A temporary compromise. That's what
works best. So, a problem like messiness
versus neatness is going to come up over
and over and over again. What do you
know? We have that one. So the way to do
it right is you go to a deeper
understanding place by asking each other
questions that really draw out
underlying themes, underlying dreams,
underlying background history maybe that
are part of each person's position on
the issue. So there's deeper
understanding hopefully a little more
compassion and then you arrive at a
temporary compromise. [music] I have an
invention and it's this notebook I keep
in [music] my back pocket. And when
Julie says the four dreaded words,
[music] we need to talk [laughter]
I
whip out my notebook and I get my pen
out and I say, ""Okay, [snorts]
I'm listening. Talk to me."" And I write
down what she says. [music]
And if I'm feeling defensive,
I just keep writing. [music]
I slow her down so I can write every
word. And as I'm writing, I kind of go,
""Oh, that's a good point. Interesting.""
So I [music] stay calm and less
defensive.
>> And John, between the two of you, who is
the messy one and who's the neater one?
>> Messy. Well, messy in the sense that I'm
constantly reading books.
The [music] pile grows and grows
wherever I happen to read. And the pile
grows right next to the side of the bed.
So eventually, our temporary compromise
is after 4 weeks [music] or so, I will
say to John, ""Sweetie, I'm going to
break my neck if I try and make the bed.
Will you please move your books?"" And
then he does and then it starts over",,

relationships for more than 50 years.
[music] And what they found is that
often these fights that we have over and
over, they never come to a resolution.
So today on the show, we're talking
about marriages. We're talking about
what comes after happily ever after.
[music] And we're talking about how you
can make your own relationship stronger,
healthier, and more loving. [music] And
if you learn one thing from me, it will
also be how to load the dishwasher
correctly. The plates all have to go the
same direction. You maximize the amount
of space.
[music]
>> [music]
>> One finding that really shocked us in
our research was this. 69%
of all relationship conflict problems
are perpetual, which means that they
never go away. They never get fully
solved. And so we learn that conflict
really mostly needs to be managed rather
than solved.
In our lab, the couples who came back
year after year kept bringing up exactly
the same issue even 20 years later.
>> So, you mentioned in your TED talk that
a large percentage of conflict is
actually never resolved, right? 69%.
>> What's a healthy end to a a conflict
that can't have a solution?
>> A temporary compromise. That's what
works best. So [snorts] a problem like
messiness versus neatness is going to
come up over and over and over again.
What do you know? We have that one. So
>> or introversion versus extroversion.
Right.
>> Right. Right. Right. The way to do it
right is you go to a deeper
understanding place by asking each other
questions that really draw out
underlying themes, underlying dreams,
underlying background history. maybe
that are part of each person's position
on the issue. So there's deeper
understanding, hopefully a little more
compassion and then you arrive at a
temporary compromise.
>> And John, between the two of you, who is
the messy one and who's the neater one?
>> Messy. Well, messy in the sense that I'm
constantly reading books.
[music]
>> The pile grows and grows wherever I
happen to read.
>> And the pile grows right next to the
side [music] of the bed. So eventually
our temporary compromise is after 4
weeks or [music] so. I will say to John,
""Sweetie, I'm going to break my neck if
I try and make the bed. Will [music] you
please move your books?"" And then he
does. And then it starts over again.
>> John, I would love for you to just move
this pillow right here [music] next to
you. And that is you have stashed a book
back there.
>> Well, it was in the bathroom and you
know, it's called How to Find Love.
>> That's important.
>> Very appropriate. I think that for a lot
of people in long-term relationships,
when you hit something that is [music]
like this where you have a pattern of
being and it keeps happening over and
over, [music] a lot of times people make
this narrative in their head that this
is like a huge problem. How how do you
address that with people?
>> Look, you are in a different [music]
body than me. You have a different brain
than me. So, there are inevitably going
to be personality differences [music]
and lifestyle differences that erupt
into conflict every now [music] and
then. It's okay as long as you learn how
to talk about it. You know, Chris, a lot
of people want to marry their clone.
[music]
However, if they did, they would be
bored out of their minds.
>> On paper, this makes sense to me.
[music] How we fight matters more than
what we fight about. But what does that
mean in reality? We asked folks to send
in their relationship questions to get
advice on how to put principles [music]
into practice.
>> Hi there. My partner wants more sex and
I want less. Do you have any advice on
how to navigate that? Thanks.
>> This is absolutely normal. It's almost
impossible to find somebody who has
exactly
uh your desire in terms of sexual
frequency. You know, unless it's your
partner wanting sex four times a day and
you want it once a year, it's probably
not a deal breakaker.
>> Yeah. Another thing that I would add is
that no to sex does not have to end
connection. M
>> so if one of you wants to have sex and
the answer is no then the next question
should be okay you know thanks for
telling me you're not in the mood for
sex what are you in the mood for should
we make popcorn and watch a movie you
want to take a walk should we just
cuddle no does not have to end
connection remember that
what is the biggest mistake that the
disasters of relationships make the
answer is that they fight [music] to
win, which means somebody has to lose.
What do the masters do instead? They
fight to understand.
I also wonder how often in your
experience, it's a problem in the
relationship, but it actually is coming
from way before you two have even met.
How often are the problems rooted in the
past versus the present relationship?
>> 90%.
Part of that exercise that we ask
couples to do in order to really
understand each other more deeply is a
series of questions as I mentioned that
they ask each other. But listen to these
questions.
>> So the first question is do you have any
ethics beliefs or values that are part
of your position on this issue? Mhm.
Second question is, is there any
childhood or [music] background history
that is a part of your position on this
issue?
>> The third question is, what are all your
feelings about this issue?
>> Another one is [music] why is this so
important to you?
>> Next, what is your ideal dream here? If
you could have the world the way you
want it any way [music] on this
position, what would it look like?
>> And the last one is, is there some
underlying life purpose or sense of
meaning that is related to your position
[music] on this issue?
>> And so conflict becomes an entirely
different thing. It's like problem
solving together, [music]
working out a puzzle together rather
than working against each other. And
those questions, those six questions are
really powerful 87% of the time at
moving people out of gridlock.
>> Hey, I'm Olivia from Los Angeles. I
recently got engaged and I'm wondering
what conversations you think people
should have while they're engaged about
their relationship, their marriage.
>> Well, we wrote a book about this and
it's called The Eight Dates. And the
eight dates really are about those
essential conversations. Not to get
people in opposition about these issues,
but really to understand where your
partner is coming from. Every marriage
is a cross-cultural experience. [music]
Even if people come from the same ethnic
group, the same racial group, the same
part of the country, even they have
different ways of creating meaning. You
know the other thing too that I would
suggest is talking each of you about
your own individual dreams and life
purpose. You know why are you [music]
alive today? Why are you uh giving
energy [music] into the world or into
yourself or into the relationship? You
know talking about questions that are so
deep and [music] so profound. And by the
way, congratulations. [laughter]
>> My wife and I dated for a long time. We
got married almost on our 10-y year
anniversary. And so
>> having been together for a decade, I
thought like surely we have talked about
everything. There's not like some sort
of new revelation. But these questions
that you put together, these are the
most common sources of conflict and
disagreement in marriage. Do you want to
send your kids to public or private
school? Um what would happen if one of
you was incapacitated medically? And
what I found is that when Molly and I
actually sat down and talked through
them, there were so many that we had
never had an explicit conversation
about. Right. Like these are really
tough questions,
>> right?
>> But they're also not things that you
just like chat about over pizza
normally.
>> Right. Yeah.
>> And
>> Right. And I think the big revelation
for me in going through those questions
that you two put together was that
>> it wasn't that we always got to a
definitive answer.
>> But it was that we got a lot of practice
at how to talk about
>> right the issues. That's the point.
>> Yeah.
>> That's exactly the point. You know, so
many people believe in the myth that you
have to be compatible in order to have a
good relationship. And it's not really
about kind of the content of those
discussions. It's more about how do you
talk about them?
Hello Dr. John, Dr. Julie. People say
that a healthy relationship requires
setting boundaries uh which make sense.
So how do you set these boundaries with
your spouse? And what happens when these
boundaries are crossed? Especially when
you have kids [music] that you can't
break away from. A lot of times when
people talk about boundaries, it's a way
of stopping discussion on an issue. It's
like saying, ""Okay, this is who I am and
there's no debating this."" And the
problem with that is that sort of all
ornone approach to conflict
>> uh doesn't allow for any flexibility.
All of our research shows that
relationships succeed by being
interdependent,
not separate and independent. If [music]
you have different preferences, talking
that through and really understanding
where the other person is coming from is
crucial to connection. If your partner
loves to drive 100 miles an hour like
yours truly and your partner doesn't
like that, you have a [music] choice to
either respect what your partner's needs
are or put your needs above theirs. So,
we would hope that you would probably
choose to give your partner the benefit
[music] of the doubt. What really
matters is that each of you feels
comfortable saying what [music] you need
and then you're giving your partner the
choice.
>> One of the the concepts that you both
became really well known for was this
idea of the four horsemen of the
apocalypse conversations. For people who
aren't familiar, can you just walk us
through what those are?
>> Yeah. Um you know what we found
initially was that there were four
negative things that people did
particularly people who got divorced on
average 6.2 years after the wedding and
these four things were the way they
started talking about a conflict. The
first was criticism which is stating the
problem [music] as a defect in the
partner's personality. You know our
problem is that you're you know
thoughtless and unkind. [music]
defensiveness. The second one, a normal
reaction to criticism, say, you know,
counterattacking [music] you. You're not
so perfect. Here's what's wrong with
you. Contempt, which is an escalation of
criticism with a tone [music] of
superiority like sarcasm does that
really an insulting superior air to the
criticism. [music]
And finally, stonewalling, which is
really emotional withdrawal from the
interaction [music]
and just tuning out. And Julie, can a
couple come back from experiencing
those?
>> Sure, we can come back when we know the
alternatives.
Most people haven't had the perfect
relationship in front of them to role
model after. When people have the
alternatives, they grab hold of them
like a sponge, soak them up, and then
try to practice them. I have an
invention
and it's this notebook I keep [music] in
my back pocket. And when Julie says the
four dreaded words, we need to [music]
talk [laughter]
I
whip out my notebook and I get my pen
out and I say, ""Okay, [snorts]
I'm listening. Talk to me."" [music] And
I write down what she says. And if I'm
feeling defensive,
I just keep writing. [music] I slow it
down so I can write every word. And as
I'm writing, I kind of go, ""Huh, that's
a good point. Interesting."" [music]
So, I stay calm and less defensive.
>> You know how many of these he has? He
has like 50 of them. [music] And guess
where they are? on top of
>> I was [laughter]
I was going to say if there's one thing
I've learned about John is that from any
[music] possible place around you or on
your body you might pull out a book of
some kind.
>> Yeah. You got to reach the the resources
>> cuz you know just my my honest reaction
to you naming the four horsemen of the
apocalypse is I've done that and I've
done that [laughter] and I can remember
a time when I did that one and that one.
>> We all have welcome to the human race.
>> It's like learning to play an
instrument. You have to practice.
[music] You have to rehearse. You have
to make mistakes and recover from them
and and so on. [music]
It really takes it takes study, you
know, to really fight, right?
>> Something that I've been thinking about
a lot since I've been talking to John
and Julie is how [music]
the idea that you can get to a place
where your relationship is done. Now we
have the perfect relationship, that's a
totally false idea. Instead, [music]
it's a muscle that you have to exercise
and grow and keep healthy.
What is one thing that you are working
on in yourself right now to be a better
human?
>> Oh, what a wonderful [music] question.
You know, I think it's this. Uh, my dad
died at 58 [music]
and he was allegedly a very healthy
person. He exercised a lot and ate well
and this and that. Then he got [music]
cancer and was gone in 6 weeks.
Well, that taught me a huge lesson in
how [music] every single day is
precious. Every single day, I'm [music]
really focused on
this, [music] this, and this. And
feeling so grateful, so grateful that I
have this [music] amazing partner.
>> Yeah, me too. So every night, you know,
before I go to sleep, I think [music]
about, isn't it incredible that I've got
this person next to me? How cool is
that? Me, too. [music]
>> It's so precious
>> waking up next to him. And so [music]
never, never, never taking life for
granted.
>> Hey, thanks so much for watching this
video. If you like what you saw, you
should check out our podcast, How to be
a better human. We have an extended
conversation with the Gotman's out now,
which features a lot more of their
research and [music] insights and
practical advice for how you can connect
with your own partner. Um, but we also
have new conversations with all sorts of
interesting and intelligent people every
Monday on [music] our podcast, How to Be
a Better Human, which is available
wherever you get your podcasts.",,
v4XF8rqEyRA,"Latif Nasser: OK, chef,
I think it's safe to say
that the entire world is obsessed
with your elaborate chocolate sculptures.
(Applause)
""La Liste"" least recognized you
as the world's most creative pastry chef.
You have billions of views
on YouTube, TikTok, Instagram,
that in addition to your Netflix show.
But more important than all of that
is that you are part of my
four-year-old's bedtime routine.
Amaury Guichon: Yes!
LN: We watch one of his 
videos every night.
These are -- my four-year-old
picked these for you to watch.
So we all watch your stuff,
but none of us know anything about you.
So where are you from?
How did you get into pastry?
AG: Originally,
I come from France.
I'm French and Swiss.
I started in the culinary
when I was 14 years old.
I was not great, academically speaking,
so I was encouraged to go to trades.
I picked culinary out of a hat, really.
And after my savory training,
I drifted away towards the sweet side,
and I really fell in love
with the transformation
of raw ingredients
into elaborate products.
LN: And so you started in France
and how did you get here to the US?
AG: When I was 21, I wanted
to learn how to speak English.
I was like most French people,
we don't speak English very well,
so I thought I would take one year
to learn how to speak English.
I was not too picky
on the destination,
and I got an opportunity
to come to Vegas 12 years ago.
And knowing that I don't party,
I don't drink.
I didn't think Vegas
would be really home for me,
but I found that in reality,
the extravagance from Vegas
was a perfect pairing
with my ability to craft wonders.
LN: Right, the wow factor.
People are always --
I've introduced your videos
to so many people.
There's two waves of wow.
The first wow is ""Wow,
look at those sculptures.""
And then the second wow is,
""He made that entire thing
out of chocolate?
The whole thing?""
AG: Yeah, it's the beauty of the material.
Aside from other medium in the field
where we rely on wood, metal, wires,
chocolate can do everything by itself
and is 100 percent fully edible.
People sometimes think
I even use paint on my product,
but it's really edible pigments
mixed with the cocoa butter,
the fat part of the cocoa bean,
that makes the showpiece so beautiful.
LN: Do you just walk around like,
pastryfying everything in your head?
You just like, ""How do I
make that out of chocolate?""
AG: It may not surprise you,
but I do do that.
When I see those big letters,
I want to make them out of chocolate.
(Laughter and applause)
LN: So when we were prepping
for this session,
you surprised me by saying
that as important as the look
and the design of your work are to you,
you actually care more about the taste.
AG: I mean, everybody
that understands chocolate
can transform it into art.
I think the complexity
as a trained pastry chef
is how do we not compromise
the taste, the texture,
and yet craft beauty?
And I think this is where
it becomes much more complex.
That's where the science really kicks in.
On taking basic raw ingredients.
You take flour by itself,
a spoonful of flour,
it's not very pleasing.
A spoonful of sugar is too sweet.
Salt is too salty.
Bite into a lemon, it's too sour.
Making the recipe,
having the ingredients collide together
to create things
that give you a good taste
is really what I like to do.
LN: Great.
Can you give me an example,
by any chance, of what you do?
AG: I mean, before all
the chocolate showpiece took off,
because social media
is very visually oriented,
so I used to put a special emphasis on it.
I own a school.
I travel the world and teach pastry.
So I have created, over the last
decades, multiple pastry.
One of my favorites is the coffee clock.
It's coffee, chocolate,
a strong espresso paired
with a strong, 80-percent chocolate,
that look like a clock.
A little piece of jewelry.
LN: OK, let's bring it out.
AG: Alright.
What you see on the screen
are some of the elements
that go into the composition
of the dessert.
LN: Because how long did this take you?
You're speeding it up for us.
He edits his own videos, by the way.
How long did you speed up here?
AG: This is just a few snippets,
but in reality, it takes
about two days of craft
for all the elements to fully rest
and have the best texture.
So for the two minutes
you guys have of pleasure,
there is two days of work behind it.
And it's true that not a lot
of people know that.
I don't know if I told you,
but when I started,
my social media channel was actually
to raise awareness on how much work
and product goes into the making of pastry
that justified the price.
LN: So your first videos
were two days long?
(Laughter)
AG: I often hear the people
complaining about the price of pastry.
Five dollars for an eclair,
it's too expensive.
And it's true.
But people go to nightclubs
and spend 35 dollars on a mojito.
(Laughter)
I wanted people --
It is true.
LN: Those are Vegas prices, I think.
AG: Our craft is
so beautiful and so amazing.
I think one thing I'm the most proud of
is being an ambassador of my industry
and being able to display the extent
of the beauty that can be achieved
in the world of sweets,
whether it's bread, pastry,
chocolate, ice cream, sugar.
And I think it's the most important.
It's for people to understand.
It was an industry, when I got in,
that was very secretive.
And I was able to break the secret,
show it to the world.
And I think when I got into the industry,
it was considered almost a lame industry,
believe it or not.
And now, just like your son.
He might be a future chef.
In the future, he might want
to become a chef.
Not just because he failed academically.
And I think that's my
proudest achievement.
(Laughter)
LN: Thank you, thank you.
AG: I hope he won't fail academically.
LN: I love your faith in me as a father.
AG: Thank you.
LN: OK, so what are we doing here?
Walk me through.
AG: So this is the clock
that you've seen on display.
I think this platform is amazing
to be able to express yourself.
I don't often speak on my video.
I usually let my hand do the work.
So I still wanted to give you a little bit
of my hand talk on the platform.
LN: Great.
AG: So here you have
various chocolate elements
that were all crafted out of chocolate.
I got an old Swiss cuckoo clock
and broke it down
and cast silicone molds so I could
replicate it in chocolate version.
And what I wanted to show you
was the final assembly of the clock.
LN: OK, what are you doing?
AG: We're going to start with the gears.
I'm flipping them upside down.
LN: I can be the cuckoo if we need.
(Laughter)
AG: You're the cuckoo to my clock?
LN: Yeah.
(Laughter)
OK, what are you doing?
What is that?
AG: So this is tempered chocolate.
So it's what you may consider glue.
LN: Oh.
Because it's quite cold in here,
I think one of the complexity is to keep
the chocolate liquid, tempered,
but not overly warm.
So using a heat gun,
I keep the chocolate --
LN: Oh, do you just have one of those
on the side of your table at all times?
AG: Yes.
LN: Because it hardens that fast.
AG: Oh, yeah.
We take one of the structure,
we press it down,
which allows it to have a structure.
One of the requirements
of being a chocolatier
is the coldness of the hands.
If your hands are above
32 degrees Celsius,
you melt the chocolate as you're doing it.
So my hands are quite cold.
LN: Oh, yeah.
AG: You actually have
chocolate hands as well.
(Laughter)
LN: I'm going to quit my job.
OK, great.
Wow, OK.
AG: Once we're done
casting the first part,
we can flip over the design.
I don't know if you guys can see.
We flip over the design,
it is quite small.
I don't know if you get a good idea
of the scale on the screen.
We're going to warm up a spatula
and glue it to our base.
LN: OK.
Wow, they look like real gears.
AG: They did come from an actual clock.
LN: Wow, it's like,
you have to work quickly.
It's like you're on a clock
to make a clock.
AG: I think chocolate is all about
time, temperature and mechanical action.
Once you understand how chocolate works,
then you can start having fun
with the matter.
Using a little suction cup I'm going to
add the elements.
One by one.
I'm trying to accelerate the process.
LN: Yeah.
AG: But it's really --
LN: You're doing surgery.
I feel like I'm watching surgery here.
AG: It's really --
It's very Swiss, right?
Making a clock...
LN: Right, of course.
AG: Out of chocolate, in gold.
(Laughter)
LN: Right.
AG: I'm back home.
LN: But like, Vegas blinged out, I guess.
AG: And the last touch will be the rivets.
LN: OK.
Wow.
And do you just have like,
extra gears and stuff, because --
Do you ever mess up?
AG: I do not.
LN: No.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
AG: But I came prepared
just in case I did mess up.
There is a first to everything.
The last thing,
will be putting the gears onto the clock.
LN: Wow.
AG: Et voilà.
(Applause)
I shouldn’t say the last thing,
because the last thing
would be you trying it.
Do you like coffee?
LN: No, I don't like coffee at all.
AG: Damn it!
(Audience shouting)
(Laughter)
LN: Oh, yeah, we only
have a few volunteers.
Audience: Frank!
LN: Frank!
Frank, come on up here.
Frank, come on.
(Cheers and applause)
Alright, Frank.
AG: Hi, Frank.
Frank: Pleasure to meet you.
AG: Are you the taster?
Frank: Apparently.
LN: Come over here.
AG: So you can still taste it
if you wish, Latif.
But I won't force you.
LN: He twisted my arm,
I guess I'll taste it.
F: It's chocolate, how do you say no?
LN: He asked if I liked coffee.
I said I didn’t.
AG: So inside you have a double chocolate
chip cookie and hazelnut financier,
a coffee creamer,
a coffee caramel espresso
and a chocolate mousse.
F: Wow.
(Laughter)
AG: I'm going to give you three o'clock.
(Laughter)
F: Thank you.
AG: And, Latif, you can try as well.
LN: Cheers.
F: Oh, my.
(Applause)
LN: Oh, my God.
F: Wow, thank you.
AG: Thank you.
(Applause and cheers)
F: I hate coffee, too.
(Laughs)
LN: He just told me he hates coffee, too.
AG: Really? Oh, that's funny.
LN: We love coffee now, thank you.
AG: Thank you so much.
F: Thank you.
LN: Everybody.
AG: Thank you, guys, thank you so much.
LN: The real-life Willy Wonka.
(Applause)
Thank you so much, chef.",,

Intentional Ambition: Redefining Your
Work for Greater Joy, Freedom, and
Fulfillment, which we're about to talk
about here at the book club today. Ra,
welcome. Thank you so much for joining
us.
>> Thank you so much, Elise, for having me.
It's so wonderful to be here. Well,
let's just start with given the fact
that everything is going on in the world
and can feel so tumultuous. It seems
like it's a great moment to just
reassess our relationships with work.
So, let's start by talking about work
culture itself. How would you describe
the current state of work?
>> In flux
and I would say massively in flux. Yeah.
Um, and I think, you know, part of the
inspiration for writing the book was
really recognizing that over the last
five years, we have all gone through a
pretty profound and unprecedented
experience on a global scale and we are
different. We are not the same. Um, and
there is a way in which I think all of
us are trying to really discern what is
the relationship I want to have with my
work, what is the way I want to work.
Um, and as we are, you know, sort of
bumping up against all of the converging
aspects of our culture with technology,
with, you know, organizational
restructuring, like all of the things
that are happening within our corporate
institutions as well as within our mom
and pop shops, for our entrepreneurs out
there, I think this question is front
and center of like, you know, where am I
and where do I want to be when it comes
to my work and the way that I work? And
that brings us to your current book,
your new book, Intentional Ambition,
which we're talking about today. How is
that situated in this landscape that
you've laid out?
>> So, this is the book that I say is
written for people who know they are not
going back, but they're still kind of
trying to figure out how to go forward,
right? And many people are pivoting and
transitioning and um realigning and
restructuring and reorganizing. Um, and
you know, there are some really
fundamental shifts that we've gone
through that are influencing the way in
which we're starting to think about how
we now, you know, cultivate these new
terms and conditions for how we're going
to come into the workplace.
>> Joy is in the title of your book. How do
you think we should navigate finding joy
and intention in our own lives? Um,
given the fear and the uncertainty or
anxiety that a lot of us are
experiencing now, given the backdrop
that we're working under,
>> I think that's the big fundamental
question because joy is now more of a
priority than it's ever been. You know,
in other words, if we sort of look at
what's different between, I think even,
you know, pre- pandemic versus post
pandemic, uh, we are recognizing that
money isn't everything. And this doesn't
mean that money isn't important, but I
think that there's a way in which our
culture,
um, has often dictated
uh, and money has also been the sort of
number one driver of dictating the way
that we work and and it's not anymore in
terms of being the number one. There are
other considerations now that are also
in here. Um, one of them is our health
and well-being and we all know you know
everything from understanding that many
of us are still living with long co to
understanding that there has been a um
universal way in which we are starting
to talk more squarely about mental
health and well-being and anxiety. Um,
you know, this conversation of our
well-being is now more front and center.
Even if for some of us it's just getting
more exercise. The other thing that's
front and center is our happiness. Joy,
right? Here we go. Back to that word.
Our relationship with the quality of our
dayto-day is more important and
imperative to us now than ever before.
And that's whether you felt like you
were able to find your groove during the
pandemic because you had the opportunity
to shelter in place or whether it is
that you didn't. Like in other words,
the wheels fell off
>> and you had to kind of reel it back in
because of burnout or fatigue or uh you
know or trauma in many cases. And so
>> happiness matters, quality of our
day-to-day matters, health and
well-being matter, purpose and meaning
matter.
>> Yeah. Yeah. But to get to those ends
that we all seek, obviously it starts
with a renegotiation or a negotiation
with ourselves, which you write so
beautifully about. So, I'd love to go
back to your own timeline and how you
kind of got to this framework that is
laid out in the book. Early on in the
book, you share a story about an
awakening that you had um that led to
your own renegotiation in your life
about following the grief um following
the death of your father. Um and how you
kind of well, first, how did you
respond?
Yeah, I mean, you know, my my joke is
that I kind of quit before the pandemic
in the sense of, you know, my father
passed away in late 2016 and um you
know, my sister and I had cared for him
for the last 21 years of his life. So,
it was a really defining moment for me
and for us. And my response to avoiding
the grief of that was to plunge myself
into work.
>> Yeah. um which is I come to find out not
an uncommon response.
>> Um and I just kept piling it on and
piling it on and piling it on and and it
got to a point where literally I just
could not get off the couch.
>> Um and I was forced to really look at
what was it that had me believe that I
could not stop?
>> What was it that had me believe that I
could not slow down? um what was it that
had me believe that my humanity was not
a priority? Um and that was everything
from whether I ate or I slept or you
know all of the sort of basic functional
things that we need to do in order to
even remotely show up powerfully for the
things that are you know commanding and
demanding our attention in the
day-to-day.
And as I began, thank God, through the
help of a therapist and a coach, as I
began to unravel and really start to
understand
what was driving me, I was kind of
floored to discover all of the
narratives that I had been carrying
unconsciously. Yeah. about why I had to
show up and push and prove and
overachieve and you know all of all of
the things at least.
>> Right. Right.
>> And and and to reckon where those
messages came from and the degree to
which I had so deeply ingrained and
buried those messages such that I didn't
even realize that that's what I was
doing.
>> One of those major ideas that you had to
renegotiate is success. and the idea of
success. Can you talk a little uh talk
us through that and how you first
thought about it and how you've come to
think about it now?
>> Yeah, I think for me success had often
been rooted in achievement, how much you
could get done, how much you could get
accomplished, how much you could uh
amass in terms of praise or accolades or
or recognition or support. And um and
there had been a real narrative for me
in terms of my father's history um and
coming through two decades of Jim Crow
segregation that you know as a black man
in America there was a particular
narrative about the degree to which
people would honor respect appreciate or
see um you for your efforts
>> and um and that was in there and I
didn't necessarily realize that was in
there. you know, my mother, you know,
Southern Baptist perfectionist, you
know, and you know, eyes dotted, tees
crossed, speaking the king's English,
pleated skirts, you know, all of those
things, you know, pressed to within an
inch of your life.
>> Wow.
>> Right. That was in there. Um and so my
need to start to reckon with and
reconcile with you know all of the
things that I had inherited about what
success meant and then certainly being
in external professional environments
where somebody else is also in an
institutional or an organizational
culture setting the standard and um in
some cases having a standard model to uh
to us right in terms of what it looks
like. All of those things were in there.
>> Yeah. Um, and none of it had anything to
do with whether or not I felt good about
myself. None of it had anything to do
with whether or not I felt some sense of
safety or security or grounding. None of
it had anything to do with whether or
not I felt any kind of sense of
belonging.
>> Yeah.
>> And none of it had anything to do with
whether or not I felt like I was
operating or living or working in
alignment with my values. And so I, you
know, and and and then no days off,
right? None of it had anything to do
with with any days off. And so all of
that had to, you know, come back to the
studs, right? And and really um in
wrestling my work ethic to the ground. I
had to really kind of go like what what
is success for me and to what degree do
I get to be a part or my happiness or my
peace of mind or my health and
well-being, physical, mental, emotional
health and well-being. to what degree
did those get to be a part of the
equation when I consider this new
definition?
>> Yeah. Yeah. As we talk about this
distinction between
external
um rewards and intrinsic or internal
rewards, it's related to a question that
we receive from a TED member. So, I'd
love to ask you the question from
Christie who wrote, ""What are
indications we are pursuing someone
else's version of success and not our
own?""
Yeah, I think one of the things that
often shows up for us is we don't often
feel connected
>> so to whatever we're achieving. So even
if we achieve it, you know, and I think
about this in the context of imposttor
syndrome and how much we've talked about
imposttor syndrome,
>> whether you're looking at it from the
perspective of an inability to see
yourself internally and what you
accomplish and how hard you work or
whether you're looking at it from the
perspective of externally where you're
not able to see yourself in the
landscapes you're navigating and those
cause questions of uh belonging, right?
Um and worthiness. Um but in this
context of you know being connected to
ourselves do we recognize the person
who's showing up every day? Um and I
know that for me uh my representative
was way alive and kicking,
>> you know, like I mean the fake smile,
the fine fine fine, everything's fine,
you know, when it was all falling apart.
Um and um and I think the degree to
which I had disconnected
from my true feelings or the degree to
which I disconnected from my authentic
expression was one of the blaring
indicators in that nothing was sort of
getting in if that makes sense. It was
sort of the numbness
>> right no matter what was going on
whether it was great or whether it was
horrible in some way I had kind of
disconnected and checked out. Another
way and this shows up a lot for people
is exhaustion. Oh yes, I relate.
>> You know, the lack of energy.
>> Yeah. Well, to follow up, once you've
realized this distinction, you've kind
of come to this moment, this fork in the
road that you confronted yourself back
in 2016,
our fellow TED member, Kelly S. asks,
""What's your advice? What advice do you
have on handling the pivot from
achieving success from other people's
eyes to focusing on your own
definition?""
Yeah, I think the first thing you got to
do is get clear about what it is that
you really want. And as much as it
sounds like it's an easy question, at
least I know for me when I was in that
period in 2017, I had to ask myself that
question for a period of months and like
really keep listening for like, wow,
what is it that I want? And I say that
because I find even now as I talk with
leaders often what we want is filtered
through what we think is acceptable.
>> Totally.
>> What we think is respectable,
>> what we think is affordable.
>> If we think about it from the context of
our econ, you know, economic stability.
Um, and so we're often filtering and um,
and it takes time and it takes courage
and it takes space sometimes to really
get to the heart and the truth of what
it is that you really want. But that's
the beginning question because once you
can ask and begin to give yourself the
permission uh to answer um, you may be
shocked at what you find. what you want
may be not as complicated or difficult
or as overwhelming or grandiose as what
you may be reaching for.
>> And in your book, this is such a great
segue to the book, Ra, because in your
book you lay out a framework to finding
our true ambition, finding our true
selves, negotiation, resignation, and
renegotiation.
Do you want to talk us through those?
>> Yeah. in the in the phases of what I've
seen us navigate through, particularly
in the context of our relationship to
work, when we're in the beginning stage
of negotiation,
I like to call it aka navigation,
>> we're kind of coming to the table on
somebody else's terms and we're really
trying to sort through how we can
succeed or figure out how we can advance
within the context of someone else's
standard. And how do we do it with the
least amount of risk?
>> Yeah.
>> Right. And these are the places where
we're doing a lot of trading, you know,
and some trades are small and some
trades are bigger, you know, whether
it's a trading of our time or energy or
whether it's a trading of the way we
part our hair or the way we pronounce
our name. I mean, you know, we could go
on and on and on. Um, you know, there
was a recent Harvard article, I remember
talking about a particular executive who
finally went back to her original given
name. Yeah. after 30 years in the
corporate arena.
>> Yeah.
>> Um going by something other than what
her given name, what her birth name was.
>> Um so these trades were making them all
the time. And so you know the
negotiation stage is the navigation. The
resignation stage is where we sort of
either give up like this is the way it
is or we say peace out no more. And I
think that that's the peace out side is
sort of the stage of awakening. Um and
then the renegotiation stage is where we
start to really consider what is
important to us. What is necessary for
us as we start to look at what it is
that we really want and what it is that
really matters. And we start to look at
the contribution that we really want to
make to our families, to ourselves, to
our communities, to the organizations
and infrastructures that we uh that we,
you know, contribute to on a day-to-day.
But of course, RA, as you've pointed
out, sometimes the barriers that prove
to be the hardest for us when we are
renegotiating or resigning. Um, some of
the barriers that are hardest to
overcome are the ones that we've
internalized inside ourselves.
What is the first step to changing our
own mindsets and accepting the
possibility of change?
>> Yeah. So, in the renegotiation process,
there are three stages. that I say we
move through. The first is reclamation,
right? And reclaiming and that has
everything to do with the stories. What
are the stories that I've inherited?
>> What are the stories that I've adopted
or created myself? To what degree do
they empower me to show up in the way
that I want to show up? To what degree
do they support my happiness, my
well-being, my thriving? Um and we have
the opportunity to really determine
which ones we want to continue to carry
forward and which ones we might want to
upgrade or refresh. Um the second aspect
of renegotiation is realigning. And this
is a really important one because this
is rooted in our authenticity which is
actually a function of our energy. And
so when we find that we are depleted,
there's often some way in which we are
out of alignment with ourselves
>> and out of integrity with ourselves. And
I say this with love and compassion,
right? There are places where we're
saying yes where we know we really need
to be saying no.
>> There are things that we're tolerating
in our environment that are really
beyond or you know have become
intolerable.
Um and there places where we are not in
our truth or we're not speaking our
truth. Um and you know there can be lots
of reasons and justifications for that.
So there's a reckoning with you and you
that kind of happens in the realignment
process and it is about coming back to
your values. It is about coming back to
your authentic self and it is about
coming back to what really matters to
you. And then the third phase of
renegotiation is the reimagination,
which is really like once we get clear,
you know, once we've kind of cleared the
deck, we've realigned with our values,
we've understood what's important, now
we get to ask ourselves, you know, if we
had our way, what would it look like?
You know, the who, what, when, where,
how, and why of how we'd like to be
showing up, particularly as we think
about the contribution that we most want
to be making when it comes to our work
and the way that we work.
Since so much of this renegotiation
requires a reckoning, do you generally
recommend that we seek outside help like
an executive coach or a therapist to
help us work through this? I would say
definitely there are going to be places
where you're going to want support. And
whether that is a therapist, whether
that is a coach, whether that just even
as a community, I find that this work is
really powerful when you're doing it in
partnership and collaboration with
others. whether that are close
professional friends or colleagues. Um
there's something very powerful about
being witnessed
>> as you share your conversations and
feeling the sense of not aloneeness. And
I think that's one of the biggest things
that I want to underscore for people who
might be inclined to pick up the book
given where they are right now in their
life and their work is that you are so
not alone. In the book, I talked to
everything from essential workers who
were working during the heart of the
pandemic to multinational CEOs and I can
tell you that the uh understandings the
places that they came to the ways in
which they came to their own
renegotiation processes interestingly
were not that different even though
their contexts would seem worlds apart.
>> Right? There's something about the
humanizing nature of what we experienced
that had us all asking ourselves the
same kinds of questions and had us all
looking at the same kinds of
opportunities and challenges as we start
to consider these new terms.
So doing it with support is is is you
know is wonderful and certainly the way
to go.
>> Rob, the title of the book is
intentional ambition. So would you mind
sharing with us what you defined as
intentional ambition versus wounded
ambition?
>> Yeah,
wounded ambition really comes from
adopting and aligning
with standards and terms and conditions
that have nothing to do with what you
want
>> and have nothing to do even sometimes
with who you are. And many of us have
had experiences in various contexts
where we've done things to fit in that
we've regretted or where we've done
things to fit in that we thought were
going to benefit us in the long term. In
other words, we made the short-term
sacrifice hoping for the long-term gain
that ultimately never arrived.
And so this internal reckoning becomes
really important because when we
understand that sometimes the playbooks
that we've been handed um and what we've
been taught about what's necessary in
order to succeed, not only in what we
want, right, in terms of having that
dictated to us, but also how we go about
achieving what we want. We can find that
unfortunately
um there's a lot of harm that takes
place in that process. Harm we do to
ourselves,
>> harm we do to others intentionally,
sometimes unintentionally.
>> Um, and part of being able to become
intentional and become aware and become
true about what's important to us is
where we begin to gain our sense of self
back, where we begin to gain our sense
of agency back, where we begin to gain
our sense of power back. It's also where
we begin to expand our capacity to be
able to contribute in ways that move the
needle on the things that we're, you
know, that we feel most passionate
about.
>> Yeah.
>> So, what is it to show up in
organizations excited, turned on, really
ready to get to the work at hand,
passionate about wanting to move the
ball forward and bringing what you
bring? and and could that be could we
see that as actually the possibility for
the status quo instead of what it is
that we're experiencing now?
>> While we're on this topic of ambition,
one of our TED members, um, Sofal E asks
a powerful question. He writes, ""How do
you redefine ambition when your earliest
ambitions were survivalbased? In this
case, Sofal is immigrant, refugee, first
generation."" How do you unlearn the
belief that joy and rest are luxuries
instead of rights?
>> Yeah, it takes courage to confront what
we've been given. And I talk about this
a lot in the book because for me, my
history would be child slavery, right?
>> Right. In terms of exactly the way in
which my you know uh ancestors and
elders came came to this country. And so
that's a lot of pressure. Um and and
even it's difficult at least because
sometimes that pressure is applied by
people who love us.
>> Yeah.
>> Often it's applied by people who love us
who want us to succeed and they need us
to be tough and they need us to be
resilient and they need us to be all
these things because of the nature of
the world that they've inhabited and had
to navigate in order to survive and
thrive. And so getting out of survival
and what does it require
is not only a mental conversation, it is
an emotional, it is a physiological
conversation. And so we are we do have
to come to the place of what are the
ways in which we're nourishing ourselves
in terms of self-love and self-care that
enable us to move our nervous systems
out of fight flight and fawn
>> and into grounding and peace and
centering and clarity. And that
inevitably requires slowing down.
So when I say courage,
having the courage to slow down and dare
I say in some cases having the courage
to stop is one of the first steps in
being able to start to unhook because
often it isn't until we can slow down
and stop that we can actually even see
what's operating. Let's get practical
though because so many people are
struggling right now. Whether they're
struggling to find a job and feel like
they have to take anything they can get
or they're working for jobs just to get
by and feel like they don't have that
extra time in order to slow down and get
reflective and get clear or they feel as
though they can't quit a job they hate
because of finances. What what advice
would you give to someone who knows they
do want more alignment? they're
listening to this conversation and they
feel like gosh, a lot of this tracks for
me, but fears, you know, there's lots of
fears and practicalities around here um
that they feel like they just can't um
navigate around.
>> Yeah. I think the first thing is to even
begin to let in to whatever degree that
you can that it is possible
>> because it's exactly what you're saying.
So much of what we get shown is that it
isn't.
And so the conversation of get
practical, get pragmatic, right? Let's
get real has to do with the depth of our
resignation
and our cynicism about what's possible.
>> Right.
>> Right. And so part of it is like the
first step is we got to get with us and
us and and like look in the mirror and
have a really honest conversation with
yourself about like what do you want to
be possible
>> and what are you willing to even like
1% believe could be possible and how do
you begin to start to walk towards what
you think could be possible? The fear of
slowing down
is also you know prevalent because we're
afraid that if we slow down we have to
confront how much we are afraid or how
much we are concerned about our
survival. But the truth of the matter is
unfortunately until we can start to move
out of survival it is hard to believe or
open up the idea that more things are
possible. So often I even tell people
just start by walking.
>> Start by just phys physiologically
moving your body out of a place of fear
and terror into a place of calm. Right?
We talk about mindfulness. We talk about
meditation, yoga, time in nature,
>> engaging in sports, right? My husband is
crazy about pickle ball,
right? Um, so whatever those daytoday
activities are that get you out of your
head,
>> Yeah.
>> and into your body may be the beginnings
of supporting this opportunity to start
to really calm down and ground. And then
baby steps, you know, so some of it may
be starting with a journal activity
where you're just asking yourself in the
morning today, what is one thing I could
do to bring more joy to my day?
>> Maybe it's just 15 minutes with your
kids,
>> throwing the ball back and forth in the
driveway,
>> right? Maybe it's taking a real lunch
today, like where you actually get up
from your desk, you know what I mean,
right? Like start with the very very
simple things
because the more that you can begin to
nourish yourself and nurture yourself,
the more space and room you'll begin to
have to really imagine new
possibilities.
>> I love that. The challenge we face and
often what has people I think hold on so
tight Elise is we believe that if we do
this work is going to suffer.
>> We believe that productivity is going to
suffer. Now, we've got a ton of science
out there that proves otherwise, right?
Like we, in other words, if you look at
all the reports, if you look at the
data, if you look at the GDP, right? In
terms of, you know, there's been all
kinds of studies that people who have a
shorter work week actually achieve more,
right? Productivity is actually higher
if you're not dragging,
>> right,
>> yourself across the finish line. And so
it is about the ingrained thinking and
the opportunity to to just begin to
start to challenge some of those ideas
that are rooted in the fact that we have
to do it this way or no way at all.
>> We talked earlier RA about indications
that we're on maybe the wrong path or
out of alignment. Another great question
that we have from TED member Ryan S is,
""I think I know where I want my career
to go, but I don't know how to get
there. How do I know that I'm on the
right path?""
>> So, the first thing I'm going to say is
this is that once you have that clarity,
you want to be starting to surround
yourself with people who share those
aspirations, who share those visions. So
definitely looking for opportunities to
gain new knowledge, looking for
opportunities to be in dialogue and
whether that's in an online community or
a physical community. I think the
opportunity to start to share becomes
really important. But I also want to say
who you share with becomes important.
And I'll say a little bit more about
what I mean. When we have a new idea or
we have a dream or we have something
that we aspire to, we will often find
the most cynical person in our life to
go and run it by.
Right? And I'm just going to say like,
you know, I think about this in in the
analogy of of our baby like right like
would you let anybody hold your newborn
baby? You know, and and we want to
consider that that when we're birthing
new ideas or when we're charting new
paths that it is really important that
we get water and sunlight.
>> Absolutely.
>> Right.
>> And that we surround ourselves with
people who are going to encourage us.
Even if they don't understand exactly
what we're doing, if they're willing to
say, ""I believe in you and if you're
passionate about it, go for it."" Like
that goes a really long way.
>> It absolutely does. I've certainly found
that in my own life. Well, as we're
talking about collaboration and
connection, we have yet to talk about
your phrase that you use called the
scarcity scare. We're so conditioned to
this narrative that there's not enough
um and not enough opportunity or work to
go around. What could work and
competition look like outside of this
scarcity mindset? Yeah, I think it's the
opportunity to let go of this belief
that a loss for one is a gain for
another. This is the zero sum mentality
that unfortunately we still are in many
ways navigating. And so part of our
opportunity is really to start to
consider like what of the experiences
that we've had in our lives of enough.
You know, one of the things I share in
the book is a story about traveling to
Africa on a creative project many, many
years ago. And we were working in a
township outside of Nairobi, a really,
really rough uh and difficult region and
area. And we were, you know, probably 20
artists and musicians packed into this
little like three room apartment
complex, right? Working on this
collaborative album. And when it came
time to eat, there was like just this
crock pot. And every day they would, you
know, come in for the market. We pull
our money and put all our money
together. And they would come back with
like uh a few bushels of uh greens, some
cornmeal
>> and a small piece of meat for flavoring.
>> And the magic that Anthony was was sort
of our resident cook. and the magic that
Anthony was able to create with that
crockpot.
>> But what was even more profound and
moving was the assurance that everybody
ate.
>> Whether we had enough pots or or dishes
to go, it didn't m people shared plates.
>> People spoon food into hands to ensure
that everybody in the circle had
something.
>> Yeah. And anytime we've had those
experiences where everybody's been seen
and everybody's been cared for and
catered to in some level, they've been
lifech changing for us.
>> So our opportunity is to start to look
at as we come into the spaces that we
occupy, as we have the ability to lead
and influence in all of the ways that we
can lead and influence outside of a
title. How are we making room? How are
we creating space where everybody can
thrive and and challenging the narrative
that there has to be winners and losers?
That's the biggest thing that I think
we're healing and transforming right
now.
>> All right, Ra, I've got a question for
those who are listening in in later
stages of their careers or entering
retirement. Someone wrote in and said
that they're in their mid70s and felt
like they didn't really have a story
anymore. So, I wonder how you would
respond to this and to the question of
having to reimagine your purpose at the
end of a working life.
>> Yeah, as I've been traveling the
country, in addition to having the
privilege to do platforms and stages
very much like this one, we've been
doing dinners in communities. And I will
tell you just two weeks ago we were in
Los Angeles with a community and one of
the gentlemen in the circle was turning
80
>> and he was pondering the very same
question because people were asking him
over and over again what what does it
feel like to be 80? And he noticed the
automatic sort of uh temptation to want
to go to his aches and pains. You know
the things that worked yesterday but are
not working today.
right? The way he described it, right,
in terms of the bodily um but one of the
things that he recognized and said was,
you know, I realize that time is a
choice that I can make for myself and I
can decide what what these next 10 years
are going to be like. The last 10 years
between 70 and 80 were amazing. And I
think this idea that you can have more
life
and you can have more joy and you can um
you can be childlike
even in your second or third act is
another part of where I think we are at
least right now when we're considering.
And so he said it took him a couple of
like weeks to really come up with a good
answer. But he said, ""You know, when
people now ask him, how does it feel to
be 80?"" He says, ""Ask me when I'm 90
because then I can tell you all the
great things I've done over the last 10
years.""
>> Yeah.
>> Right. So each moment discovering ne",,
,,,
things. So I want to invite your,,,
adventure, your sense of adventure now,,
more than ever because you got a lot of,,,
wisdom to share and you still probably,,,
have a lot of world to see.,,,
>> Absolutely.,,,
>> Giving yourself permission to do that.,,,
This conversation has been full of,,,
stories and the stories that we tell,,,
ourselves, this the ones that we,,
inherit, the ones that we build and,,
shape for ourselves after a,,,
renegotiation. So, in the leadup to this,,
conversation, Rah you shared a few,,
questions with us for the TED community,,,
and you asked," """"What is a story you tell",,
yourself about your place in life or at,,,
work that's no longer serving you? What,,,
is the new story that you want to be,,,
able to tell instead?,,,
In what ways do you think you're,,,
struggling to get there? Really great,,,
prompt, very thoughtful. And before we,,
share some of what y'all submitted, Ra,,
do you mind just briefly sharing an,,,
example of your own story with us about,,,
a story that maybe stopped serving you,,,
and how you found your new one?,,,
>> Yeah. When I had my breakdown in 2017,,,
one of the things that became really,,,
clear to me was that I was holding a,,,
narrative that said I was responsible,,,
for fixing everything that was wrong,,,
around me.,,,
>> And some of us may relate to this,,,
right? You're known as the responsible,,,
one in your family. You're known as the,,,
one in your circle that always comes to,,,
the rescue with just the right thing for,,,
everything and everybody everywhere.,,,
And what I had to tell the truth about,,,
for myself was that it was exhausting.,,,
As much as I cared,,,
um, and as much as I felt like I had to,,
prove I cared, um, it was creating a,
life that was unmanageable for me,,,
because there was no way that I could be,,,
everywhere and be everything to everyone,,,
all of the time. It's just impossible.,,,
>> Yeah. And so the new story I had to,,,
create for myself was one that,,,
acknowledged that part of caring for the,,,
world is caring for myself, too.,,
And making sure that I could have what I,,,
needed to be healthy and thriving.,,,
>> Yeah. so that I could then make healthy,,,
choices about where I would show up and,,,
what was mine while honoring re and,,,
respecting what wasn't mine.,,,
>> Yeah.,,,
>> Right. So that was about setting,,,
boundaries. That was about really caring,,,
for me. And that new mantra, that new,,
way of articulating that new narrative,,,
is what gave me the permission to start,,,
to do that.,,,
What a powerful unlock. That's awesome,,,
Ra. Um, thank you for sharing and thank,,
you to our TED community for submitting.,,,
We had so many thoughtful answers to,,,
this prompt and I wish we could share,,,
them all, but Rah has reviewed them and,,
chosen a few that she would like to,,,
respond to. So, here's the first one,,
from Ozgushi who wrote,,,
I studied in the health department and,,,
graduated successfully. I've always,,,
cried when I was studying in that,,,
department because I wasn't happy. But I,,,
tried to keep going just because my,,,
family wanted me to.,,,
>> I was living for their pride and,,,
acceptance. After graduation, I had,,
major depression and stayed at a,,,
hospital for a while. After that, I,,
decided to live for myself. I started to,,,
study for my dream department. And,,,
currently, I'm a second grade university,,
student at age 26, 27 in November. I,,
feel like I'm a burden now because I'm,,,
not making money. I'm not working, but I,,
can't find any job while studying. I,,,
want to have high grades, but sometimes,,
I feel like I'm doing something wrong,,,
and I should just quit and start to work,,,
at any job. So, I'm mostly struggling,,
because of economic issues and the,,,
mental problems that this causes. Still,,,
I don't want to give up because I feel,,,
like life is a journey. Even if I'm,,,
late, even if I'm doing something wrong,,
I know that I will learn from it. And in,,,
the end, I want to say I didn't give up,,
>> and that I'm doing what makes me happy.,,,
Mhm. Yeah.,,,
So the mantra that I would lovingly,,,
offer to you is one that invites you to,,,
believe that you can,,,
do what you love,,,
and that you can take care of yourself,,,
like be well taken care of in what you,,,
love.,,,
That doesn't mean that you have to,,,
sacrifice that you can do work that you,,,
love. You can pursue the field that you,,,
love and you can be well taken care of.,,,
The beauty is that you're in an,,,
environment, an educational environment,,
where you're learning. So one of the,,,
opportunities might be is to sit with,,,
other people who have done it, who have,,
walked that path and who have created a,,,
career or a field of endeavor around,,,
that and become curious about other,,,
people's paths and journeys who are in,,,
your field. But again, it starts with,,
starting to work with that new narrative,,,
and that new conversation like I can do,,,
what's passionate uh and moves my heart.,,,
I can work in the field that I want to,,,
work in and I can take care of myself,,,
and I can be well supported and cared,,,
for as I do it.,,,
Thank you so much. Okay, our next one is,,
from Kim H who wrote in and says," """"The",,
old story I'm ready to change. I have to,,,
carry it all to make it matter. For,,,
years, I've believed that my impact is,,
directly tied to how much I shoulder,,,
"alone."""" This sounds like you", Ra. that,,
if I slow down or ask for help, the old,,
version of you, of course, that uh that,
if I slow down or ask for help, the,,
vision will shrink or stall. This story,,,
has fueled progress, but also burnout,,
isolation, and a quiet fear that I'm,,
always one step behind. The new story,,,
I'm building systems, teams, and,
communities that let purpose move,,,
through me, not depend on me. I want to,,
lead from a place of aligned energy, not,,
obligation. I want my work to feel like,,,
a collaboration with life, not a fight,,
against the clock. What's blocking me?,,,
I'm good at strategy and execution, but,,
letting go of control, delegating,,
deeply, and truly trusting others with,,
the mission still feels like a risk. I'm,,,
navigating how to release the martyr,,,
mindset while still holding the bar,,,
high. That's my edge right now.,,,
>> Yeah. So the mantra that you can walk,,,
with and start to work with is that I,,,
lead from inspiration and am fully,,,
supported by those around me. I lead,,,
with compassion,,,
and accountability,,,
that I can stand in excellence and be,,,
lovingly joyfully met by those I,,,
collaborate with.,,,
And so again, the context in being able,,
to utilize this mantra and story then,,,
also invites you to be in transparent,,,
communication and explicit communication,,,
with the people that you're,,,
collaborating with. Sharing your fears,,,
but also sharing your vision. The way,,,
you'd like to work, the way you'd like,,
it to be. The places where you'd like to,,,
have them partner with you. Hear their,,,
visions. What are their hopes around the,,,
way that they'd want to work and in what,,,
way could they partner with you? And,,,
creating a shared vision and a shared,,,
commitment and a shared set of,,,
agreements that enables you to release,,,
more.,,,
>> Yeah.,,,
>> And and allow more.,,,
>> Yeah. Support.,,,
>> Wonderful. Wonderful. Okay. One last one,,,
is from Jeannie J who writes," """"Story no",,
longer serving me is, I've recognized a,,
tendency to undervalue or minimize my,,,
own expertise and contributions which,,,
has sometimes limited the recognition,,,
and opportunities available to me,,,
"professionally."""" New story I want to",,,
tell. I'm stepping into a professional,,,
narrative of clarity, confidence, and,
meaningful impact where my expertise and,,,
passion align seamlessly with abundant,,,
opportunities, career advancement, and,
professional fulfillment.,,,
[Music],,,
>> I mantra I stand in my value,,,
and I allow amazing opportunities to,,,
flow to me.,,,
I stand in my value,,,
and allow amazing opportunities to flow,,,
to me.,,,
The invitation here is to begin to,,,
recognize and even start to give voice,,,
to what it is that you uniquely bring.,,,
And this is an exercise to anyone who,,,
feels shy or insecure or nervous. Right?,,,
Many of us have been taught culturally,,,
not to toot our own horns.,,,
>> Anybody hear what I'm saying?,,,
>> And yet, when it comes to wanting to,,
attract the kinds of opportunities that,,,
we want or the kinds of opportunities,,,
will make a difference to us, it's,,
important that we be able to share what,,,
we bring, be able to recognize, be able,
to humbly honor what we bring. And so,,,
the assignment is to actually write out,,,
here's what I bring. Here's what I want,,,
to bring, my passion, my skills, my
talents, and then stand in. When I stand,,
in my value, I allow amazing,,
opportunities to flow to me.,,,
>> I love that. I love all these mantras.,,,
They're so helpful. Thank you for,,,
sharing such thoughtful and important,,,
reflections. We have a few more minutes.,,,
So, before we wrap, we have lots of,
questions from our members. And that's,,,
how we will close out our hour as we,,,
typically do. Ra, are you ready?,,
>> I'm ready.,,,
>> Okay. Manoj M asks," """"How can young",,
leaders stay true to their purpose when,,,
the pressure to succeed often means,,,
"compromising or playing it safe?""""",,,
>> This is a practice and I'm going to say,,,
to you all like, you know, when we're,
looking at bridging between the old,,,
reality and the new reality, there are,,
four things that I think are are crucial,,,
and I don't want to sugarcoat them. The,,,
first is courage.,,,
being willing to step outside of our,,,
comfort zone in contribution and in,,,
honor of the places where we want to,,,
grow.,,,
The second is patience.,,,
It may not happen overnight. Some things,,,
are going to move quicker than other,,,
things, right? Some things are going to,,
be a little bit more stubborn. But even,,,
if we can take baby steps in the,,,
directions of the changes we want to,,,
make, we're still moving, right? any,
progress is still progress.,,,
The third is permission.,,,
Where are the places we're telling,,,
ourselves that we can't? And we've got,,,
lots of justifications and lots of,,,
experiences that reinforce that we,,,
can't. But again, where is one place,,
where we can give ourselves permission,,,
to step outside of whatever narrative,,,
that's been keeping us boxed into a,,,
particular reality. M,,,
>> having integrity operating in your,,,
values manoj is the way in which we get,,,
to really show up more authentically as,,,
ourselves. It gives us more capacity to,,,
lead and we can do that in a way that's,,,
not antagonistic.,,,
The fourth and final thing is practice.,,,
So every day, what can I practice that,,
brings me more joy, more peace, more,
freedom, more clarity, more fulfillment?,
One thing every day. What can I,,,
practice?,,,
>> Yeah.,,,
>> Yeah.,,,
Wanderly D asks," """"How do we achieve",,
success in light of fast-paced trends?,,,
How can we really be seen outside of,,,
"social media?""""",,,
[Music],,,
So the first one in terms of trends is,,,
the opportunity to really ground in what,,,
is most meaningful to you. Sometimes,,,
there are aspects of trends that can be,,,
very inspiring and sometimes there are,,,
aspects of trends which we know can be,,,
very alienating. And so part of it is,,,
really looking at when I think about my,,,
own creativity and I think about my own,,,
imagination. Are there things that I,,,
want to co-create with, but I want to,,
find how to do them my way, which is,,
often what I hear at least, right? Like,,
I'm not mad at AI necessarily, right?,,
Though some of us might be, but I want,,
to figure out how to do it my way, you,,
know, right? And what is my way? Um, so,
there's something about giving yourself,,,
permission to really approach whatever,,,
may be new or hot or interesting in a,,,
way that really invites your,,,
authenticity to the table and your,,,
clarity to the table. The second part,,,
is, and I think that this is going to,,
become more and more the case, coming,,
back to being in community, being in,,
circle, we respect and appreciate that,,
social has a role to play. There are,,,
ways in which we get access to things we,,,
wouldn't in an online world. But there,,,
also is something about sitting in the,,,
grass,,,
right, with your local community walk,,
neighborhood group, right? There's,,
something about being with people in,,,
shared space that also is an important,,,
aspect to your life and not,,,
underestimating the value of being seen,,,
and the value of having that humanto,,,
human inperson connection.,,,
>> Okay, lovely. Jennifer S asks,,
Achieving can be fun. How do we aim for,,,
that fun level without spilling over to,,,
an unhealthy level of achievement?,,,
Underachchieving can feel unfulfilling.,,,
Yeah. Pay attention to your energy. This,,,
is the alignment conversation. There's,,,
nothing wrong with purposeful effort.,,,
There's nothing wrong with inspirational,,,
pursuit. But if it gets to a point where,,,
you find you're dragging yourself or you,,,
find you're beating up on yourself or,,,
you find you're putting undue pressure,,,
on yourself and it's producing anxiety,,,
or it's producing fear or it's producing,,,
doubt. I'm going to say you're a little,,,
over your edge. And this is a beautiful,,,
distinction that comes from the work of,,,
Gail Stra and David Gerson called the,,,
growing edge which is we find that place,,,
where we're ripe and ready for the,,,
change. In other words, we're not,,
forcing anything which takes us into,,,
terror and constriction but we're also,,,
not hanging out in our comfort zone. So,,,
where's that place that's just enough of,,,
a stretch, right? where you're leaning,,
in. It's uncomfortable. It's new. You're,,,
figuring things out. There's excitement.,,,
There's a sense of adventure. There's,,,
curiosity. There's awe. There's wonder.,,,
And then noticing when it tips for you,,,
either direction that you have the,,,
opportunity to start to recalibrate.,,,
>> Yeah. Okay. We have time for one more,,,
question. So, I will ask it for Tara W.,,
who asks," """"Staying intentionally",,
ambitious right now can be challenging,,,
for even generally optimistic people.,,,
>> What might be the most fundamental,,,
"practices to stay on a positive path?""""",,,
So, this is an opportunity for you to,,
kind of recap for us too, Ra.,,
>> Yeah. Do the things that ground you,,,
that center you, that bring you peace.,,
Whether that is knitting or walking or,,,
just looking out the window or staring,,,
at the water or walking by the beach.,,,
Those small simple things that give you,,,
a sense of perspective, that ground and,,
center your energy, that regulate your,,
nervous system, that invite you to,,
really get to a place of quietude, where,,
you can really listen and hear your own,,,
wisdom and clarity. and the guidance,,,
that often comes from the ability to,,,
step back and regroup. Regrouping is,,,
imperative.,,,
I can't say that enough, right? At least,,
regrouping is imperative. So, my daily,,
practice journaling, prayer, meditation,
my evening practice, time in nature. I,,
walk along the water. I look at the,,,
trees. I look at the flowers. I look at,,,
the sun. Um, and it gives me the,,
opportunity to reflect and decompress,,,
from the whirlwind of the day-to-day.,,,
The more that we can be grounded and,,,
centered, the more that we get the,,
guidance we need to be able to make the,,,
choices and decisions we need to make in,,,
a day-to-day.,,,
Let's stay on you for one last question,,,
from me, Rah, which is what is the,
mantra that's keeping you going right,,,
now? You've offered so many to our,,,
listeners, but what about you?,,
>> Yeah, I have postits. You all can't see,,
this, but on my wall I have mantras,,
and different postits that I look at.,,,
And one of my favorite particularly,,,
because this was a tough week for me.,,,
>> Joy is always my destination. M,,,
>> so like no matter where I'm at, no,,
matter where I'm feeling and give myself,,,
permission to feel it, but I ultimately,,
know that joy is my destination that,,,
this is where I'm going and that allows,,,
me to let the experience move through,,,
and keep on moving.,,,
>> Beautiful. Beautiful.,,,
>> Thank you so much to Raw Goddess for,,,
this incredibly moving and motivating,,,
conversation. I have personally learned,,,
so much. I'm sure our listeners have,,,
too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so,,,
much, Elise. It's been my pleasure.,,
Thank you so much, Ted family. Really,,
"been a joy to be with you today.""",,,

May I
make a few
in the morning and still jumping cuz my
mama ain't home. I got in the
living room getting it on and they ain't
leaving till 6.
 I got a pocket full of my homeboy.
>> I run a parody music social media
channel called There I Ruined It. The
purpose of the channel is to ruin music
or as I say to lovingly destroy your
favorite songs. And AI is one of the
tools that I often use to do that. The
term AI music doesn't really clarify
anything. And in fact, even our own
lawmakers don't really seem to
understand this, which kind of leaves
musicians like myself to come up with
our own guard rails for how to use AI,
what's right and what's wrong. And for
me, it kind of comes down to three
things. The first is, is it deceptive?
Could somebody believe this is actually
real? Next, is there artistic intent
behind it? So, if you're one of these
people that's mass- prodducing AI songs,
hundreds of songs, and uploading them to
Spotify, your intent is probably not
artistic.
And then finally, how does this affect
the musicians?
And often times the victims of the songs
that I create actually end up sharing
those same songs on social media. Even
with all of the many downsides of AI
messing with our music, I think a lot of
artists are discovering the same thing I
did, which is there are ways to use AI
that can actually increase creativity.",,
PNoQzQwbTFU,"You wake up in a new world.
Your eyes open
to bright, confusing lights.
Your ears are filled
with mysterious sounds.
Everything around you feels unfamiliar.
This is a reality of a newborn baby.
So what is it like to be a newborn?
For a philosopher
and a psychologist like me,
this is a fascinating question.
It is hard enough to know
what's going on in adults' minds.
What could be going on
in a newborn baby's mind?
Do babies have consciousness?
The subjective experience
of their mind and the world.
In adults, consciousness
involves experiences
of seeing, hearing and thinking,
and feelings of pain,
pleasure and emotions.
Do babies also have
this experience and feelings
that light up their inner world?
So the traditional view is
that newborns are passive observers
of overwhelming chaos,
and they may not be conscious at all.
It sounds unbelievable today,
but 50 years ago,
doctors routinely performed circumcision
without anaesthetic,
convinced that newborns' immature brain
could not feel pain.
Since then, developmental psychologists
have shown that infants' abilities
are much more complex
than we thought before.
But the question of infant consciousness
has remained open.
One problem is that infants
cannot tell us how they feel.
They cannot describe their thoughts.
And they certainly cannot
take a consciousness test.
So how can we know
what's going on inside their minds?
One answer is to measure infants' brains.
Over the past few decades,
the science of consciousness
has told us a lot
about the brain basis
of consciousness in adults.
We found neural signals
that are only active
when an adult is consciously
perceiving a stimulus.
Recently, neuroscientists
found the same neural signals
in infants' brains.
These provide powerful new evidence
that infants might be
actively experiencing their surroundings
from a remarkably early age.
One innovative experiment in neuroscience
is the audible paradigm.
This is a test of how our brain reacts
when something unexpected happens.
I love this paradigm,
and here’s how it works.
Imagine repeatedly hearing
the same sequence of sounds.
Beep, beep, beep, boop.
Beep, beep, beep, boop.
Beep, beep, beep, boop.
Suddenly, this familiar pattern
is interrupted by a different sequence.
Beep, beep, beep, beep.
Instantly, your brain
detects the surprise,
producing a measurable brain signal
called the P300 wave.
This oddball response
to an expected sequence of sounds
only happens when
an individual is conscious.
People in deep sleep don't have it.
People in comas don't have it.
But newborn babies do.
The neuroscientist Ghislaine Dehaene
has found that when babies
are just a few days old,
they show the same type of brain activity
in response to this oddball
sequence of sounds.
What this suggests
is that right from birth,
infants might be truly experiencing
conscious perceptions
and conscious expectations.
Researchers have also looked
for consciousness
through patterns
of attention in the brain.
In conscious adults’ brains,
different types of networks
alternate their activity
when we switch our attention
between the external world
and our internal thoughts.
You know how it is.
You might be doing this right now.
You focus your attention
on the speaker for a while,
and then you daydream for a while.
(Laughter)
It turns out that infants
do the same sort of thing.
The neuroscientist Lorina Naci
recently observed
the same type of alternation
between these networks in newborn brains.
This suggests that these switches of focus
of internal and external awareness
are present right from birth.
There is also evidence
from gaps in attention.
When our mind
intensely focuses on one thing,
it usually becomes blind to something
that happens immediately afterward.
We call this phenomenon attentional blink.
Infants experience this phenomenon too,
but in slow motion.
At three months old,
infants take near a full second
to shift their attention
from one visual cue to another,
compared to adults that can manage
this shift much faster.
Amazingly, infants showing
the same type of brain response
when this happens
is strongly hinting they are actively
experiencing their environment.
Researchers have also found
relevant brain patterns
in premature infants.
Which makes you wonder,
could consciousness begin before birth?
This is a really important question.
I told you all how scientists apply
the audible test to newborns.
Well,
they applied the same test
to late-term fetuses
around 35 weeks into pregnancy.
The results were striking.
Fetus shows the same type
of brain response as we found in newborns.
So even before birth
and entering the world,
babies seem to be capable
of consciously processing sounds,
meaning their awareness might develop
while they are still in the womb.
Of course, these results
have potential implications
scientifically, medically and ethically.
For a start, we now know
that when we perform surgery on newborns
or premature infants
or late-term fetuses,
we should give them an anesthetic.
I know that many of you will be thinking
about the abortion debate.
In that context, I should stress
that our strongest evidence
is that consciousness
requires brain structures
that emerge after 24 weeks of gestation,
a time when abortion is rare.
The new evidence
[that newborns are conscious]
might extend to fetuses
in third trimester of gestation,
but it doesn't extend
to earlier than that.
This is a new understanding,
and this new understanding
is a work in progress,
but might change our picture
of newborn babies.
They are not passive creatures
waiting for consciousness to switch on.
They are tiny humans
already perceiving patterns
and interacting with the world
in a meaningful way.
As human life unfolds,
consciousness unfolds with it.
Our sense of ourselves grows and changes.
Our consciousness waxes and wanes
until one day it ends.
From the moment we take our first breath
to the moment of our deaths,
our lives are lit
by the flame of awareness.
We share this flame with other animals
and we might one day
share it with machines.
Collectively, our conscious minds
illuminate the universe,
and though each flame eventually fades,
the light of consciousness
never disappears.
It is rekindled with each new life
in the endless dance of existence.
Thank you.
(Applause)",,
OKu0yybmtkc,"Now I'm going to start by getting you
to visualize sporting greatness.
And what do you see?
It's probably athletes like LeBron James,
Caitlin Clark, Saquon Barkley,
Simone Biles, Ronaldo, Messi.
You see, we tend to think of athletes
from quite a small subset of countries.
So I'd forgive you for thinking
that the best talent in the world
just comes from those places.
But that's not strictly true.
Because talent existed long
before their sporting greatness,
and many things
have to happen along the way
for them to realize their potential.
Now, one thing that's commonly overlooked
is that they got an opportunity
and were visible.
You see, talent exists everywhere.
It's finding the talent
that can be the challenge.
So how do we do that?
Now typically, that's scouting.
It's every young athlete's
dream to be scouted.
You see the old guy up in the bleachers,
he's writing his notes,
and later you get the call,
he wants you to try out.
It's a thrilling fantasy
for so many people.
There's only so many scouts.
Now I'm from the UK,
where Chelsea Football Club
have one of the most prestigious
and well-funded youth academy
programs in the world.
But each Premier League team,
or each Premier League scout,
can only see about 2,000 players per year.
But millions play the game.
And even from those 2,000,
it's already super limited
by the player's geography,
their cost factors, their access factors.
Lots of young people are now
taking that into their own hands.
They're uploading social media clips
of their best plays online.
But now we've just replaced
a human with an algorithm
that's not designed for talent ID
to decide who gets seen.
What do we do about that?
It's simply not possible
for Chelsea Football Club
to see every talent in the world.
Or is it?
You see, there's technologies now
like computer vision,
AI and deep learning,
that are helping us bridge that gap.
Now, personally,
I'm not a scout or a coach.
My route was biomechanics,
which is the science of motion.
And like many people in my profession,
we work in sports laboratories
or with clubs with a remit
of improving athlete performance
or reducing injury risk.
And I was working in my lab that one day,
my now founder and CEO, Darren Peries,
walked in with his son, Reef,
who was struggling with an injury,
and we started analyzing him
with all this wonderful equipment.
And we got talking
about the scouting problem,
and he noted just how unfair
and biased scouting could be.
He'd seen it himself.
Entire futures could be decided
in one day by one person
who has an opinion.
He noted how completely devoid
of data youth scouting can be.
And he said to me,
what if we took all this lab protocols,
all the data, all the equipment,
and put them into a set
of standardized smartphone drills
so any kid, anywhere in the world
could be tested fairly and equitably?
For me, it was a brilliant vision
to a genuine problem.
So I joined his team, ai.io,
where we build AI-based
solutions across all of sport.
Now the first thing we built was aiScout
for the problem at hand.
And here's how it works,
simply speaking.
Kid downloads an app for free
and they record themselves
doing these predefined drills
directly from the phone.
We use computer-vision AI
in the cloud to analyze that.
We analyze 22 key body segments.
We can even do things like
turn the 2D video into an inferred 3D
and bring all that together.
We get things like what direction
did they run, how did they turn,
how high did they jump, the speed,
the symmetry, the coordination, and so on.
But collecting that raw-level data
is just one part of the problem.
So you've got to know
how to interpret that data,
and you've got to be able to score
an athlete based on that data.
And most importantly,
you've got to make it specific
for those that are looking for talent.
Specificity is key here.
For example, in football --
soccer, for the Americans
in the audience --
each team or scout or coach
kind of look for a different thing
depending on what they need
at that given moment of time.
So some teams or coaches
might want athletes with power and pace,
others might want
coordination and technique
and great body movement.
So we have to make our scout,
we have to be tailored,
on that club-by-club basis.
Now to answer these questions
and really to build out that product,
we partner with two Premier League teams,
Burnley Football Club
and Chelsea Football Club.
And we started by just
asking them directly,
if we could analyze any kid
in the world, from a smartphone
and give you football-specific metrics,
what do you need to know
to make that relevant
to you and to use it?
And interestingly, they said,
comparable, benchmarkable, reliable data.
And above all else,
both themselves and the kids
they'd be analyzing,
would need to understand
where the data is coming from.
There can be no ambiguity.
So we started developing
these predefined drills with them.
They were ten-meter sprints,
counter-movement jumps,
they were dribbling through cones,
they were passing, shooting.
This is nothing new.
This was just genuine things
that scouts would normally look at
to make an assessment of a player.
And then we sat down with those scouts
and looked through a ton of video.
Do you prefer player A or player B?
Now it turns out the art of scouting
is actually incredibly complex.
So much of what experienced
scout does is really intuitive.
So whilst they knew
they preferred player B,
and maybe most of us can,
looking at the video here,
but they couldn't articulate it to us.
So we had to sit with them,
ask the questions,
and turn their insights
into something we could use to score.
We created the algorithm.
And with that algorithm,
we just pumped thousands
of videos through it.
So we started to make benchmarks
and standards across age and gender.
Because of course,
you can't analyze a 13-year-old
to a 22-year-old.
The 22-year-old is almost always
going to be bigger, stronger, faster.
You need to compare
13-year-olds to 13-year-olds
so you can really see who stands out.
And talking of standing out,
I'll never forget, when we were
first developing the app,
we recruited 50 college kids from the UK.
They were, honestly,
kind of average footballers,
except this one guy, Ben.
They all did our drills
and he was head
and shoulders above the rest.
Like, just really, really good.
Like, he was 17.
How has this guy
not been scouted before?
And the crazy thing is,
he lived just minutes down the road
from Chelsea FC training ground.
He wasn't in some remote village.
He was literally down the road
from one of the world's best academies.
The system didn't see him, but we did.
I'll cut a long story short here,
but this is where we knew
what we were building was working.
Because he got a trial
for Chelsea Football Club,
scored in his under-18 debut,
and he later signed for another
Premier League club
and even represented his country.
But that wasn't enough.
We needed to test this
in those remote places.
This should be for everyone.
Now, theoretically,
because all the heavy lifting
is done in the cloud,
the analysis of the video,
the processing, the scoring, the modeling,
it means that whether
you're from London or Mumbai,
if you've got access to a smartphone,
this thing can work.
And we're lucky to partner
with Reliance Foundation in India.
They have an amazing program where
they send scouts out every single year
to find the best 11-year-old talent
to give them five-year scholarships
to play sport and have free education.
With the best of those
generally going on to play
professional sport in India.
Same problem as Chelsea.
Few scouts can see a few thousand people;
potentially millions that are eligible.
So they turned to us
to try and find some
of those hard-to-reach kids
in difficult locations.
And they put out a call
on WhatsApp to their audience.
New to us to do this on WhatsApp,
but the parents and students
were asked to download an app
and do the drills inside the phone
and trial for Reliance Foundation
directly from aiScout.
Tens of thousands of kids
now do this every single year.
And the best ones, based on their data,
get sent to an in-person talent ID day
where the scouts make the decision
on who gets those scholarships.
It's a great example of how
we're augmenting the scouting process,
not just replacing their processes.
The best example of success was,
we've had many there,
is one player actually downloaded the app
from a shared community phone,
had never played organized sport,
and got himself a five-year scholarship.
On top of that, only last year, the IOC
and their partner at the time, Intel,
they reached out to us
about the up-and-coming Youth Olympics,
which is in Senegal.
They had a little concern that actually
the Senegalese national teams
didn't have enough talent
to fill all the teams
that are going to be
in those Youth Olympics.
Now, here's the great thing
about the technology.
You want to play football?
You can trial for a football
club through our app.
You can also do the opposite.
Based on your strengths,
it can tell you what you might be good at.
So if you've got great acceleration,
great reactive strength,
it could be rugby sevens or futsal.
You've got great upper body power
and hand-eye coordination.
It could be a baseball or a softball.
And that's exactly what we did.
We put the app into tablets,
we gave it to military leaders
and school teachers,
and they just stood there
and they recorded the kids in their class.
A few days into that,
thousands of kids later,
40 are now being trained
ahead of those Youth Olympics
in things like wrestling
and athletics and football.
Now, where does this go from here?
So the app today runs
through partnership programs,
talent ID initiatives,
with clubs, with federations,
sometimes there are
brand partners on the app,
where hundreds of thousands of kids
trial and do these drills.
Hundreds of those have had
successful outcomes
and now playing professional sport.
And where do we go from here?
Actually we go global with this, right?
So it's now multi-language,
it's starting to roll out into the app.
Multi-cloud is coming.
So it can be cloud-agnostic,
which means we can put
country-specific things into the app
in any region that we need to work with.
And right here, in the US,
proud to announce the MLS,
or Major League Soccer
as we know it here,
have rolled this out
to the MLS NEXT program.
45,000 kids right now are using
the app three times per year.
Preseason, mid-season, postseason
so we can track and monitor
their changes over time.
And the great thing is,
the scouts and the coaches
get all the data in real time
via our control center.
It's not a black box,
but something they can trust
and learn from the data
and see where that data is coming from.
And where else do we go?
It's probably not a big leap
for you all to imagine
how we start to move into things
like at-home healthcare and medical.
But we're also starting to create
the kind of movement libraries
for American football, for basketball,
for baseball, for cricket.
Because the underlying
movement primitives,
the cut, the deceleration,
the jump, the throw, the strike,
they translate well
across quite a lot of sports.
Because one thing in sport is always true.
Talent is universal
and brilliance exists
in every corner of the globe.
Now, with technology
and your very own smartphone,
you can make that talent visible
and level the playing field.
Thank you.

Wt3E7xSiuxA,"Parrots are really highly social
creatures, often live in big groups,
really complex, and have really deep and
meaningful relationships with each
other. And yet, when we keep them as
pets, we often keep them alone.
So, I started to wonder, would a parrot
video call another parrot if given a
choice? Me and my collaborators, we
started to build a screenbased system on
a tablet which had profile photos of
different parrots and then taught
parrots how to trigger the video calls
by using their tongues on the screens.
And what we found is that they actually
had favorite friends in the same way
that me and you have favorite friends we
like to call.
We also found that the they did more
calls the more they were called in. So
there's an element of sociality here.
there.
We then looked at what behaviors they
did within the calls and they did such
vast and wonderful different behaviors.
For instance, they groomed together as
you can see here.
They also played together. They showed
each other their toys. They danced
together and they even sing together.
When we surveyed all caregivers, what we
found is that 100% of caregivers said
that their bird benefited from this
system,
they said that they felt closer to their
bird, that it helped their relationship
with their bird, and they had more trust
in there. Now, I'm biased because I
build this technology, but I really see
the enormous potential that this
technology can bring. It's got so many
exciting possibilities and 100% of
animals we've given this technology to
so far use it and it benefits the
relationships with their caregivers.
So the next time you make a video call
to a loved one, just remember that a
parrot might be doing the same, reaching
out across the divide, seeking
connection
and companionship in their own unique
Okay.",,
R4_trBh25Vk,"The Olympics has always served
as a touch point for me to reflect
on just how quickly our world changes.
Think about it.
Every four years,
the Summer Olympics
shine a massive spotlight
on how much our technology
evolves between the games.
So I want you to take a minute
and picture yourself in the year 2004.
Try to remember the world back then.
We didn't have iPhones,
The Facebook, as it was originally known,
was just emerging on college campuses
and YouTube?
It wasn't a thing.
I competed at the Athens
2004 Olympics in women's rowing,
which may as well have been
the ancient Olympics,
as far as technology goes.
I was still using a flip phone,
and I sent my friends and family
email updates from the games
using my Hotmail account
and dial-up internet.
(Laughter)
So now I want you to imagine
what it was like
to win the first US Olympic medal
in the event in 20 years.
And rather than getting to instantly
share that news with the world
via my Instagram or TikTok account,
my teammates and I had to wait to see
if the Olympic broadcasters
and journalists would cover it.
Our story was entirely
in their hands to tell or not.
Well, 20 years later,
and all of this has changed.
In an instant, we have sports scores,
match results and news stories
at our fingertips
and on our phones the moment it happens.
And this is incredible.
But there's still a problem.
It's one thing to seek out
the information you're looking for.
It's another thing entirely
to stumble upon it.
The stumbling upon it goes like this.
You're scrolling through
your social media feed,
you see something
that captures your attention,
you click on it and poof!
Down the rabbit hole you go.
You're locked in.
Well, this stumbling upon is what
we in marketing call discoverability.
And for sports, it's the magic
that fuels existing fans
and captures new ones, pulling them in.
But while it's easier than ever
to search for sports news on Instagram,
TikTok or Google,
the information that fans stumble upon,
or rather discover,
well, it's served up to us by algorithms.
They use historical data,
fan interactions, and what's trending.
Which mainly skews to men's sports.
Despite incredible talent,
heated rivalries and growing popularity,
women's sports remain largely
invisible in our daily content feeds.
And this has real-world implications.
I've spent nearly two decades
in global sports
and entertainment marketing
at IMG, at Visa and now at Google,
and I've seen firsthand
how and why this happens.
So I want to unpack this with you all.
I want you to think
about these technology platforms
as massive digital libraries
and the algorithms as the librarians.
They’re great at organizing,
indexing and cataloging information,
but here's the important bit.
They can only make recommendations
from what's on the shelves,
which historically,
for many decades and only
until very recently,
has been 19 stories about men's sports
for every one story about women's sports.
Nineteen to one.
So if I ask any of these
technology platforms,
who has scored the most goals
for their country
in international football,
who do you think I get?
Most of you are debating,
is it Cristiano Ronaldo?
Maybe Messi?
Well, as of recently, Cristiano Ronaldo
has scored 141 goals for Portugal.
But factually speaking,
this answer is wrong.
And spoiler alert, it's not Messi either.
The correct answer
to this gender-ambiguous query
is Christine Sinclair of Canada,
with 190 goals.
(Cheers and applause)
That's right.
This isn't just a mistake.
It's a symptom of a bigger problem.
And it's one example of many.
These gender-ambiguous queries
come down to word-matching issues
within the algorithms.
When sports journalists, commentators,
content creators
consistently publish content
that gender-qualifies women's sports,
but not men's,
we get an imperfect response.
For the person looking to settle
the Messi versus Ronaldo debate,
this answer works,
and for the majority of people
entering this query,
this is what they're looking for.
But the factual omission
of women in these answers
and in our daily content feeds,
well, it negatively impacts the athletes
who have worked very hard
for the distinction,
but also the fans who are looking
for this information.
This lack of visibility fuels what's often
referred to as the vicious cycle
of underinvestment.
The vicious cycle of underinvestment.
In 2023, for example,
president of FIFA Gianni Infantino
went on record criticizing many
of the traditional broadcast networks
for offering up to 100 times less
for the women's rights,
even as the 2023 World Cup
tournament approached half that
of the men's tournament.
The same thing's happening
here in the United States
with NCAA men's and women's basketball.
The men's tournament earns
1.1 billion dollars per year
in media rights fees,
17 times more than the estimated value
of the women's tournament,
even as the last three finals,
on average, are approaching par.
These costs, they don't just
undervalue women's sports,
they're undervaluing
the women's sports fan,
which is a huge miss
in the bigger economic picture.
It turns out, compared to men's sports,
fans of women's sports are younger,
they're generally more tech savvy,
and they're more loyal to brands
who sponsor women's sports.
But in a world where
men's sports are everywhere
and women's sports are harder to find,
these short-sighted media
rights holders and gatekeepers,
well, they're failing,
certainly the athletes,
but also the fan
and especially, and maybe
more importantly, our girls.
Which leads me to the real kicker.
Despite the recent surge
in women's sports,
our girls are still dropping out of sport
at twice the rate of boys
by the age of 14.
If they can't see incredible content
of female athletes
crushing it in sport and in life,
it makes it harder for them
to see sport as a pathway for themselves.
If they can't see it,
how can they ever dream of becoming it?
I know without a doubt,
I would not be the person
or leader I am today,
were it not for the lessons
I learned as an athlete.
The grit,
the determination, the teamwork,
the accountability, the resilience,
all of it has had a significant impact
on the rest of my life.
And this makes sense.
We know there's a direct correlation
between girls who grow up playing sports,
becoming women who lead.
But while 94 percent of C-suite women
grew up playing sports,
only six percent
of global CEOs are female.
Which means when girls drop out of sports,
a significant pipeline
for future female leadership suffers.
Now there is good news.
Women's sports are growing,
and it's thanks to the contributions
of new media players
that are reimagining the sports
landscape for women's sports.
Brands who understand the value
and are leaning in,
athletes,
fans who are working as content
creators behind the scenes.
And yes, even you and me.
Brands and media rights holders
who understand the value
of women's sports audiences,
they're leaning in and they're
reimagining traditional models
around sports rights.
Take Visa.
They became the first-ever
standalone sponsor
of UEFA women's football.
They worked with UEFA
to basically unbundle
the women's sponsorship rights
from what was traditionally sold
as a bundle with the men's.
Another interesting example this year
came from streaming platform Netflix,
who secured the exclusive rights
in the US and Canada
for the next two
FIFA Women's World Cups.
I'm proud to say that at Google,
we're tackling the bias
challenge from both sides.
We're getting smarter at responding
to your gender ambiguous queries
while at the same time working
with content teams like Arsenal,
Liverpool, women’s clubs,
making sure that across
India Women’s Cricket,
the WNBA, the National
Women's Soccer League,
we're creating more stories
for the algorithmic librarian
to catalog and recommend.
This is an example
of Liverpool Football Club.
Today, when you enter this
into the search query,
you're given the choice of do you want
the men's team or the women's team?
Our search products are getting better
at women's sports discoverability,
and at the same time,
we’re working with media partners
at ESPN, “The Athletic,”
even “British Vogue,”
increasing the coverage of women's sports.
Athletes and fans
are also playing a critical role
in reimagining new models.
They're building their own audiences
with social media,
creating brands that live
far beyond the field of play.
Take US rugby player Ilona Maher.
She blew up on social media
during the Tokyo 2020
and Paris 2024 Olympics
with her hilarious
behind-the-scenes glimpses
of athlete life in the Olympic Village.
She became her own media channel,
connecting with audiences
and making herself
and women's rugby more visible
and more relatable
than traditional media ever could.
Canadian creator and fan Logan Hackett,
aka “sportswithlogs,”
is another awesome example.
She breaks down complex plays,
rules and controversies,
making women's sports easier to understand
and more accessible to new fans.
More recently, I've been paying attention
to how AI is poised
to accelerate all of this.
While AI slop is a real thing,
in the right hands,
tools like Gemini and ChatGPT
can enable anyone to create thoughtful,
production-level, quality content
and distribute it at scale.
Take podcast host Sean Callanan,
whose “Sports Geek” rapid rundown podcast
uses AI to curate
the business news of the day
into daily episodes
on a variety of topics,
all in his own AI-generated voice.
He churns these out
with incredible speed and efficiency.
But the real impact?
That's going to come from all of us.
Your likes, your shares, your follows,
the athletes that you track,
the sports that you follow,
it all plays a significant role
in contributing to the library
of women's sports content.
My challenge to you is this:
Go futher.
Go beyond what the algorithm serves you.
Follow athletes that intrigue you.
Maybe try your hand at telling their story
as a content creator yourself,
even if on a small scale.
If you're a brand,
consider investing in women's sports media
or becoming a sponsor.
If you're a consumer,
buy brands who sponsor women's sports.
It all matters.
For too long, ""you cannot be
what you cannot see""
has been a quiet barrier.
But what if we flip that from a warning
into a call to action?
Had I been able to instantly share
my proudest Olympic moments way back when,
I wonder what young athlete I would
have reached through the void,
and what boardroom
she might be sitting in today.
Leveling the playing field
for women's sports
is going to take all of us,
from brands, media rights holders,
athletes and fans, to you and me.
When we choose to reimagine
the future of women's sports,
we open the door to possibility.
Let's reimagine the future
of women's sports
not as something
we have to work hard to find,
but as something we deliberately
and collectively build to be seen.
Thank you.
(Applause)",,
1o7znNK19Pk,"Let me tell you a story.
This story begins in the summer of 2008.
It's one of those scorching summers
where everything stops
and time itself seems suspended.
I'm 11 and sitting in front
of the computer for days on end,
melting into my chair.
Somehow my dad has found this website
that he claims is this cool,
new virtual-reality experience.
And I'm 11, which means
I still trust my dad.
So I hop on this site, right?
It's called ExitReality,
which is exactly what I want to do,
because it's 42 degrees outside
and there's no air con in our apartment.
If you know what Second Life is,
it's kind of like that.
You can make your own avatars
in the most rudimentary 3D graphics
I have ever seen in my life.
And then supposedly you can meet with
and talk to other avatars
in this endless expanse
of digital landscape
engulfed in a permanent sunset.
But because it is 2008,
everything freaks out
when you press any button,
and the lag is enough
to give anyone anxiety.
I mean, I already had anxiety
as an 11-year-old,
so it made me want to literally die.
But I persevered even though
there's nary a soul in sight.
I key-smashed my way through
pixelated deserts and abandoned streets.
And then, in the corner of my screen,
something appears.
Someone appears.
Their avatar is wearing
a leather jacket and a mohawk.
So I approached them and I'm like,
""Hey, nice mohawk.""
Once again, I'm 11,
so please withhold your judgment,
I'm begging you.
We start chatting
and he tells me his name is Tommy,
and then he asks ""ASL?""
Which, of course, means
age, sex, location.
And obviously I'm like,
""17, male, Canada,""
even though I'm an 11-year-old boy
living in northwest Sydney.
(Laughter)
We added each other on MSN,
and we start talking for hours a day.
I'm talking hours since both of us
are horny teens or tweens, in my case,
with absolutely nothing better to do.
He tells me his favorite band
is Death Cab for Cutie,
and I'm like, ""Oh my God! Same!""
Even though the only
thing on my iPod is Coldplay.
(Laughter)
And then suddenly, we fall out of contact.
I'm not sure how it happened,
but it was devastating.
Pulverizing.
One day we were talking for hours
and the next we just weren't?
My first real heartbreak,
though certainly not
my last online boyfriend.
Now you might be wondering
why I’m telling you this story.
And it's not just because I love
embarrassing myself on stage.
Tommy, if you're listening,
please DM me, I'm desperate.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm telling you this story
because I know you have a similar one.
Especially if you also grew up
in the days of the early internet, right?
Maybe you also got your heart broken
by some guy you'd never met.
Or maybe you were less dramatic than I was
and just made a friend on Club Penguin.
Or God forbid, Habbo Hotel.
What I'm saying is this:
we should return to the days
of the early internet,
the Wild West of the internet,
where everything felt a little looser,
a little jankier,
a little more spontaneous,
where you, too, could meet
the love of your life
and get ghosted as an 11-year-old.
(Laughter)
Where discovery still felt possible.
Here's the thing.
The internet, as it is right now,
is more restricted than ever, right?
More corporate, more buttoned up,
more difficult to find things outside
of what we actually want to see
and what's fed to us algorithmically.
I'm an internet culture writer,
and my screen time is 12 hours a day,
which means I'm clinically insane.
But even if you use the internet
like, a normal amount,
I'm sure you'll have noticed
that the internet today
is a very different place
to what it was five, 10, 15 years ago.
The internet, as it is right now,
is both vaster and harder
than it ever has been.
If you're on TikTok,
which I think most of you are,
you'll know that micro trends pop up
at the speed of light,
then disappear into the ether,
never to be spoken of again.
As an experiment,
I wrote down a list of things
that were going viral on TikTok
about a month ago
while I was writing this talk, right?
Here's that list now.
""The Hunger Games,"" OK.
Vodka pasta sauce.
Flavored water, ""WaterTok""
and unicorn syrup.
Being a ""la la la girl""
versus being an ""OK, OK, OK girl.""
I mean, none of these words
are in the Bible, right?
If you cast your mind back even further,
the trends become even more meaningless.
I'm talking ""coastal grandma aesthetic.""
I'm talking ""frazzled English woman.""
I’m talking the return of twee,
pasta chips, whimsy goth,
dark academia, Barbiecore.
What do these words even mean?
(Laughter)
We are cycling through content
at such a velocity
that things become old news
the second they hit the feed.
Even me standing here right now,
telling you that things
are happening faster.
You guessed it, that's old news too.
To quote one famous meme,
“Everything happens so much.”
All of this means
that it's harder to see the things
that we actually want to see.
We're losing control, this is not new.
But what if there was a solution?
What if we could turn back time?
What if we could bring back
some of the features
that made the early internet
so utopian, so lawless,
so full of spontaneous connection
and random experimental zeal?
Well, we can.
So the first solution is the galaxy
brain solution, of course.
It's to repurpose our existing platforms
into spaces that feel
like the early internet again.
For the past couple of years,
I've been turning to niche Facebook groups
as replacements for the early
internet forums of the 2000s.
I know I’m going to sound like the world’s
oldest zoomer right now.
But back in my day,
we had these forums with message boards
where you could message people
about your specific interests,
things like Fall Out Boy
and other emo bands,
countercultures and various subcultures,
PlayStation games, etc, etc, etc.
For the past decade or so,
a smorgasbord of Facebook groups
have popped up kind of in their place.
They act very similarly to these forums.
There are groups
for public transport stans.
There are groups for architecture heads
who just really love stairs.
There are groups for sharing
disgusting photos of terrible food.
I mean, there is a group for everyone, OK?
There is a group called
Subtle Asian Traits
that many of you might have heard of,
and it's literally just a group
about being Asian.
And it has two million members,
making it one of the biggest
Facebook groups, right?
Now is the peak time of absolute chaos.
We are living in a time when everyone,
even your aunt's friend who keeps
sending you minion memes,
has left Facebook.
Which means the only people
left in these groups
are truly the most desperate,
the most committed, the most insane,
the people who have thrown
all caution to the wind
and said, ""Who cares,""
to any given conventions of social media.
These spaces are completely
shielded from the frenetic,
demanding nature of online life today.
You can choose whether to post or not,
whether to engage or not,
whether to take things further or not.
You most likely won't know
anyone else in these groups.
There are hardly any celebrities
either, in these groups,
no one's in it to be seen.
Being in these groups
is truly like experiencing
the last, almost, utopia online.
Now there is also an easier solution,
but you need to bear with me, OK,
because I know it sounds super dumb.
The solution is to talk to your friends.
And I promise I don't mean this
in a kind of ""get off your phones,
we live in a society"" kind of way, OK?
Promise.
I mean, talking to your friends
and asking them
what they're listening to,
what they're consuming,
what they've come across on their feeds.
The worst thing about the algorithm
is that it's so tailored to us
that it can feel inescapable.
But the best thing about the algorithm
is that it's so tailored to us
that no two feeds are the same.
Your friend is listening to a song
that you would have never encountered.
Your parents are on a side of YouTube
that you didn't even know existed.
Your aunt's friend is still
sending you minion memes, OK?
I want every person in this room
to try one thing after this.
Open up your phones, you have permission,
open any app
and show the person next to you
the first thing on your feed.
You might be surprised at how strangely
vulnerable the experience is
and also how surprising the results are.
I mean, this is how I found out
that my partner's TikTok feed
was 90 percent musical theater content,
which made me question
all of my life choices.
But ignoring that,
looking at your phone
and looking at someone else's feed
can help us bring back
the randomness of the early internet.
Think back to me and Tommy, for example.
What we shared was a random,
fleeting encounter which couldn't
have happened anywhere else but online
or at any other time
but the early internet.
That phase might be long gone,
but we can still bring back
the emotional high
of spontaneity, of discovery.
So go forth and be crazy again.
Go and have your heart broken by some guy
who lives three continents away from you.
Go and discover a corner of the internet
previously hidden from you.
Go and be a tween online again,
and go and turn the clock back to 2008.

3cD0AMzflSQ,"I drank really heavily for a really long
time. Um, I knew it was too much and a
problem for me, but I was like, ""Yeah,
but like it's the only thing I like, so
I'm not going to like stop drinking.""
And then one day I was like, ""No, it's
not that hard.""
>> Like it's not the one thing I like. It's
like I think I'm just like willing to
see what life is like without it.
>> Deciding to get sober is a big thing.
It's a huge thing. But another big thing
that many people don't talk about as
much is figuring out what your life
looks like afterwards. When you cut
something out, what do you replace it
with?
>> I just started doing anything that I
still liked. I had like a few things
that [music] I liked doing that were not
drinking and I just did those a lot.
Like I knit, I [music] watched ASMR
videos. I watched TV. I read [music]
thrillers cuz like you it was like kind
of real with myself. If I just been
sitting there with nothing to do like
the hands will just start creeping
toward the line and be like, ""Oh, you
just might as well let me."" For a while,
I was going through this really dark I
don't know. It was sort of a rough time
last [music] summer. It was just like I
wasn't publishing anything. I wasn't
doing anything. I was still drawing, but
I didn't really know what to do with it.
And I just like I don't know how it
happened, but I got this idea. I started
drawing mermaids, [music] like sketching
mermaids. And then I started I was like,
""What if these mermaids too had like a
very mundane life?"" So, she like started
a newsletter [music] about her mermaid
life, but like her mermaid life was like
really boring. So, I started this whole
mermaid newsletter. It has like 20
installments. [music]
She was single and had no children. I'm
not even sure I believe in love. I think
it's just like being open to [music] new
experiences and retrying things. Like
just keep testing everything you think
you know about yourself.",,
OtSwoGuz8sk,"So most of the time when we think
about climate change,
we conjure these images of wildfires
and storms and floods.
But the reality is
that temperature alone kills.
And in particular, right here in Africa.
We don't see it in the capital
of France or the US,
because it's mostly happening
in poor countries,
which are already hot,
and where citizens
don't have the protection
of air conditioning or office jobs.
By the best estimates,
by the end of this century, in 2100,
an extra six million people will die
just because of increased temperature.
And all of these deaths will take place
in low- or middle-income countries.
Every ton of carbon that we emit
from the US, from India, from China,
stays in the atmosphere
for a very, very, very long time,
contributes to the warming
of the Earth and therefore,
kills people.
Now let's try, for the sake
of concreteness,
to put a dollar value
on these lives cut short.
Now I can see what you're thinking,
the economist comes,
you know, we cannot really price a life.
The reality is, we are doing
it all the time.
As individuals, we are thinking
about, you know,
the probability of dying
in a bicycle accident
and the cost of a helmet
and we kind of weigh
one against the other.
And our governments also do it.
For example, when thinking
about the cost of investment
that can protect the lives
of people on a highway, for example.
Mexico, which has
about the world's average income,
uses a value of a statistical life
of about two million dollars.
So using this number
of two million dollars
for a value of a statistical
life, as a benchmark,
we calculated the dollar value
of the life lost
because of emissions.
And the costs are staggering.
Every year,
the greenhouse gas emissions of the OECD
inflict a cost 
of 1.7 trillion dollars --
with a T --
on low- and middle-income countries.
And the costs are the largest
in the countries that are the poorest.
Take Niger,
a country where the GDP
is just shy of 650 dollars a year.
The yearly damages from the OECD
emissions in Niger are 9,000 dollars.
Meanwhile, from COP to COP,
rich countries are nickel and diming
the poor countries for the climate money,
for mitigation, for adaptation.
We are supposed to be
on the road map from Baku to Belem
from 300 billion to 1.3 trillion,
but it is likely to be a road to nowhere
if we continue with buzzwords
and with hairy schemes.
The money is difficult to raise.
It's even harder to spend.
Climate negotiators
from India, from Africa,
are so tired to negotiate
with dozens of outfits
to access money that should
legitimately be theirs.
So there has to be a better way.
And I'm here to tell you one better way.
So first of all, how about we stop
beating around the bush
and try to raise 1.7 trillion dollars
for our moral debt to the poor countries?
(Applause)
Can we do that?
Well, yes, we can.
But let's face it,
there is no money to be made
saving the life
of an old woman in Pakistan.
And this is too much money
for philanthropy.
So the money has to come
from publicly-funded
international redistribution.
Now you're looking at me and saying,
""She probably was under
the rock the last few months.""
Every country in the north,
starting from the US,
but not ending there,
is cutting international commitment,
not adding to them.
So how can I go and say,
well, how about 1.7 trillion of new money?
So we have to take the money where it is,
which is in the bank accounts
of the richest people on the planet
and the largest
multinational corporations.
Now --
(Cheers and applause)
Before you think I'm,
you know, a dangerous alien,
I'm not talking about expropriation.
The reality is that the richest
people on the planet
do not pay their fair share in taxes.
(Applause)
Warren Buffett, who is no communist,
quipped that he paid less
taxes than his assistant.
And it's true.
But it's not just in the US.
Worldwide, rich people have all sorts
of perfectly legal maneuvers
to avoid paying the same taxes
as everybody else.
Proportionately, they pay less taxes
than anybody in this room, probably,
unless you're a billionaire.
(Laughter)
A tax on the wealth of the 3,000
richest people in the world
of about three percent a year
would raise 400 billion dollars.
A slight increase in the minimum tax
on multinational corporations
from 15 to 21 percent
would raise 300 billion dollars.
I'm not dreaming,
because the tax
on international corporations,
it exists already.
Twenty years ago, it would
have seemed crazy to think
that we could have an agreement,
worldwide, to have such a tax.
And yet, in 2021,
120 countries signed a treaty,
and it's already implemented
by 40 countries.
And what is nice about it
is that it does not require
every single country to participate.
If the US, for example,
doesn't participate,
the way the rules are made,
France and Germany, for example,
can tax the US companies
on their sales in France or Germany
to make sure that overall,
they pay 15 percent on their profits.
We could do just the same
for the billionaires.
France and Germany
could send them a tax bill,
say, to Jeff Bezos,
in the unlikely event that Jeff Bezos
doesn't pay his taxes,
they could start levying money
on Amazon's tax in France.
So this is feasible.
This is already in the conversation.
Brazil put it on the map
during their presidency of the G20.
It made it to the final declaration
with support from many countries,
including France, for example, and Spain,
and with support from some
of the Brazilian richest billionaires.
Thank you, Neto Setubal.
Now
it has also a lot of support.
Seventy percent of Americans
and 80 percent of Europeans
are in support of a tax
on the wealthiest people
to help the poorest people
cope with climate change.
But some people are a little worried
that what would we do with the money
if we managed to raise it?
The climate activists are worried
about international
institutions hogging it,
and the rich countries are worried
about developing countries' governments
using it for their own purposes.
So here is a simple solution.
Send it straight to people.
(Applause)
We know how to do it.
The infrastructure is already there.
Chief of all, here, in Africa,
where almost everyone has
a mobile money account already.
There are more than 100
randomized controlled trials
of cash transfer programs
that show that people use the money well.
And moreover,
the money not only is used well,
but it also helps resilience.
For example, in Zambia,
when people received about 12 dollars
a month in a support income,
not only did it increase
their consumption on average,
but it removed the ups and downs
that they get with drought
and flood usually.
Here in Kenya,
people used a universal
basic income that they had
to finance, first, a better
roof over their head,
and second, solar panels to power a fan,
a pump or a cell phone,
thus increasing resilience
and increasing productivity.
For some countries which are very poor,
there is enough damage money
to fund a UBI for everyone
such that nobody has to live
under the poverty line.
For richer middle-income countries,
there is enough to fund
a sort of insurance
where no one needs to work
when it's 35 degrees outside.
Finding ways to reliably collect money
to pay for our moral debt
to the world's poorest citizens
would do a lot to repair the trust
between the West and the rest.
And it is badly needed,
because the reality is
that the future of climate mitigation
is in the countries that are today poor.
Even if the OECD, even if the US, Europe
managed to reduce their emissions,
unlike the countries 
of Africa, India, etc.
don't get into a crazy trajectory,
the climate fight will be lost.
So the future is here.
And it can only be done if there is trust.
So what we need
is really a new grand bargain
about climate mitigation and adaptation.
What we need is a situation
where every poor country
is entitled to the damages
that our continued emissions
impose on them,
and in exchange of this money
for their citizens,
they commit to forceful climate action,
including potentially
carbon-pricing mechanism.
It's urgent, it's feasible,
it's just.
So all of you here,
especially any billionaire,
either in the room or watching me,
please stand up and demand
a billionaire tax for climate justice.
Thank you.

[music]
This is a selzer with lime. It's what
[music] I order when I'm at the bar
these days. I'm a comedian and I'm often
in situations where everyone else is
drinking, but [music] I don't drink
anymore. So, this is what I get. You
know, since I stopped drinking, I go to
sleep [music] earlier. I wake up
earlier. My life is, I hate to say it, a
little bit boring.
So, how do you relate to yourself
[music] when you've made a big change?
How do you still feel like you without
doing the things that you used to do?
Our [music] guest today is Edith
Zimmerman. She is a cartoonist and a
writer, and she's also sober. She's been
[music] documenting her journey through
sobriety and her daily life through her
cartoons and her writing and her
newsletter for many years now.
>> [music]
>> So, I decided to visit Edith to ask her
some questions about what it means to
change who you are, [music] to exercise
a lot of self-discipline and to be
creative about what your life looks like
dayto-day.
[music]
[music]
I'm a writer, an artist. I live in
upstate New York and I run a newsletter.
It's illustrated with stories about my
life. I don't I don't know how much
>> That's great. That's perfect. Well, how
much information should I
>> I would say like why not promote like I
think you should say drawing links or
whatever you want to say.
>> Okay, smart.
>> Hi, I'm Edith Zimmerman. I'm a writer
and artist. I live [music] in upstate
New York. I send out a newsletter called
Drawing Links. The hardest part about
stopping drinking was worrying that
nothing was ever going to be funny
again.
It was also hard to upend my social
life.
>> No, I'm going to stay in forever, but
thanks. Your work is really honest and
[music] I'm curious, have you always
been good at being honest with yourself?
>> I drank really heavily for a really long
time and I was um I knew it was too much
and a problem for me. But I was like,
""Yeah, but like it's the only thing I
like, so I'm not going to like stop
drinking."" The honesty part for me, I
think, just came when I was like, ""Well,
yeah, that obviously is bad, but it's
like like what else am I going to like
this is the only thing that's fun for
And I was kind of just like holding
these two things that seemed I'm like
I've got to solve this incredibly
difficult puzzle. Like nobody else
before me has dealt with something so
challenged. Like and then one day I was
like no it's not that hard.
>> Like it's not the one thing I like. It's
like I think I'm just like willing to
see what life is like without it.
>> Deciding to get sober is a big thing.
It's a [music] huge thing. But another
big thing that many people don't talk
about as much is figuring out what your
life looks like afterwards. [music] When
you cut something out, what do you
replace it with? And when I stopped
drinking, I just started doing anything
that I still liked. I had like a few
things that [music] I liked doing that
were not drinking. And I just did those
a lot. Like I knit, I [music] watched
ASMR videos. I watched TV. I read
thrillers cuz like you it was like kind
of real with myself. I was like, ""What
do I actually like to do?"" And cuz like
if I just been sitting there with
nothing to do, like the hands will just
start creeping toward the wine and be
like, ""Well, you just might as well let
me."" I keep trying to write and draw
about how helpful knitting was and has
been with not drinking. It occupies your
hands in a way that's like m well. It's
like they get so occupied they don't
have time for anything else. It's like
hand food.
Literally after I quit drinking, maybe
even the next day or that same afternoon
or something or that week, I Googled
like what do people do besides drink? Um
kind of as a joke to myself like the
 is happening? Um cuz it wasn't it
was sort of like a humorless time where
it's like okay like phase two there's
like top 10 lists like go to a cafe like
go to a museum. I'm like am I really
reading this right now? And one was like
rediscover activities you enjoyed as a
child. But I'm like, ""Yeah, right. Of
course."" But that was kind of the gold
mine.
>> I drew about you this morning.
>> Oh, really?
>> Yeah. I drew this morning like d I'm
excited to meet Chris [music] and I
couldn't really remember what you looked
like, but I drew this.
>> That's like close enough. That's like me
without a beard.
>> But like sometimes I draw from a photo
and other times I just draw from memory
and I'm like this doesn't look like it
at all.
>> [music]
>> I think that you have a very distinctive
style and like if I saw your drawings, I
would know that they were yours even if
I didn't see you doing them.
>> Yeah.
>> Do you
think about that at all? [music] Like do
you ever like do you ever try and like
draw like totally different style or
something like that? [music]
>> Uh no.
It's accidental, you know, like you you
see a you see like an artist whose style
you totally [music] recognize and at
some point at least at least what I
assumed was someday they sat down and
were like, I'm going to draw like the
cheeks in this funny shape and that's
going to be my [music] thing. But I just
started drawing stick figures um or like
ball heads with like little necks and
like circle eyes. And then [music] I
just kept doing it and kept doing it and
like slowly it evolved and now I feel
like I have a style but it's like none
of it was conscious [music] or
purposeful.
>> I think people also have this idea a lot
of times that like drugs or alcohol are
the key to creativity or being
interesting.
>> Yeah.
>> I think there's lots and lots of
examples of people like making their
best work or making work at all after
they stopped using or stopped drinking.
>> Yeah. And it sounds like kind of cool.
It's like oh you sort of like blur the
lens a little and something more
truthful will come out. And I think
everyone has an experience where that
actually happens too. That's the that's
why it's tricky. Like it starts out kind
of fun. You have like one or two
positive experiences such that like you
can no longer really be honest with
yourself later on when you're like am I
having that many positive experiences
now or am I just like repeating the same
thing that worked like eight years ago
once or twice? A lot of your day-to-day
and a lot of my day-to-day is like
taking care of young kids, which is like
on the one hand like very relatable to
many people and on the other hand like
very boring and routine and the same and
like be being able to find like
something really funny about that and
relatable [music] I think can like crack
you out of it in a make you see it in a
different way.
>> For a while I was going through this
really dark I don't know it was sort of
a rough time last summer was just like I
wasn't publishing anything. I wasn't
doing anything. I was still drawing, but
I didn't really know what to do with it.
And I just like I don't know how it
happened, but I got this idea. I started
drawing mermaids, like sketching
mermaids. And then I started [music] I
was like, ""What if these mermaids too
had like a very mundane life?"" So, she
like started a newsletter about her
mermaid life, but like her mermaid life
was like really boring. So, I started
this whole mermaid newsletter. It has
like 20 installments. [music]
>> She was single and had no children. I'm
not even sure I believe in love. when
you can be mundane within [music]
something like thrilling, I find that
like very pleasing. Or it's like, oh,
I've inhabited the world of this
mermaid, but like yeah, she just like
[music]
wants people to like her and just like
eats like garbage. She was actually a
health blogger. I start my morning with
a sand dollar smoothie and 3 hours of a
cargo ship sound [music] bath. We can
imagine like the most fantastical other
world and then like really quickly it's
like [music] just another day being a
mermaid. Does anyone read my mermaid
blog? What does it even matter?
[laughter] You're like you're a mermaid.
Please God.
>> But no, but that's why it's funny. It's
like all the thoughts I'm really having
when I'm feeling so sorry for myself.
It's like as if the mermaid has it is
funny.
>> Being a mermaid is hard sometimes.
you wrote this really beautiful article
about running and how sobriety and this
physical activity of going for runs and
jogging had an interesting relationship.
Can you just tell us a little bit about
that?
>> Also, I just want to say I feel like I'm
starting to feel just like like an
imposttor where it's like, oh, you
journal and you run instead of drink.
It's like, yeah, you and like 50% of the
population running.
>> Well, what's the imposttor part of that?
>> Well, it's like, yeah, there's nothing
special about what I do, so like why
would anyone want to talk to me about
it? I think you're special, but I know
that's that literally sounds like a Mr.
Rogers episode, [laughter] but I think
you're special, but I do. But I I mean,
really, I think the fact that it works
for a lot of people is why I'm
interested in it.
>> It was not difficult to stop drinking,
but what was difficult was finding stuff
to do with the time that emerged because
it was not just like a little time, it
was a lot of time.
And so I think it's really important to
swap out habits.
Okay, so we're about to go on a run with
Edith on her normal running path.
And I just I I can't emphasize enough
how much I do not normally run. And what
you're about to see is not going to be
pretty and it will probably be indecent.
How often? How often? Like like twice a
year, once a year. No. No.
>> Well, this year this will be the first
time. [laughter]
>> Okay.
>> Um I mean [music] if you count like like
I've moved,
>> right?
>> But like gone for like a jog. [music]
Not because I was like late for
something. This will be the first time
that I've run this year.
>> All right. So we'll start down [music]
this way.
I have a lot of energy and I have like a
capacity to be really dedicated to
things which when you're like having a
big hangover or you're just like
repeating your [music] wine it doesn't
it doesn't you don't feel like
passionate and devoted
>> like what is it that you're getting out
of it
>> just [music] like doing a thing that I
feel good about. I like tiring myself
out.
>> I like that I can do it. I like taking
some time away from the house. Like
[music]
>> what do you think about
uh dwelling on things that have
happened, like replaying scenes,
yelling at people in my head. Usually
I'm in a better mood by the time I get
back, though.
>> Yeah.
>> And it's like once I achieved a certain
level of fitness, I could just like kind
of keep going and not think only about
whether or not I had to stop running.
>> I [music] won't lie, I am already
thinking about when I could stop
running. As I tried not to pass out or
literally cough up a lung, I couldn't
help but notice how well disciplined
[music] Edith is. And it's not just that
Edith stopped drinking and then replaced
it with a habit that is better for her.
[music] It's that those habits made her
feel better about herself. Edith.
[laughter]
So, there's been this process of like
self-discovery of asking yourself like
[music] what is it that I do and how do
I spend my time? How has that process
been an ongoing process and how has it
been something where like [music] you've
found things and you want them to stick
and be pillars?
>> It's like, well, what do I like to do?
And it's not easy. How do you take a
moment to be like, do I even like what
I'm doing right now? And like, how do I
change it? [music] I think that can be
too overwhelming of a question to think
about sometimes if you're in a situation
where [music] it's really bad. But the
answer is dull. It's like just keep
testing everything you think you know
about yourself is probably not true. I
think it's just like being open [music]
to new experiences and retrying things
cuz sometimes like the situation is just
totally different or you're totally
different.
[cough]
I'm I mean I'm fine. It was great. It
was really great running with you.
>> Yeah.
>> Thank you.
I'll catch up.
>> Okay. [gasps]
>> [sighs]
>> After spending the day with Edith, one
of the things that I'm thinking about a
lot is how you [music] might not be the
same person that you are now tomorrow or
in 5 years. You can change. You might
become an artist or a runner. You might
become sober. These [music] things that
are such a huge part of your life, they
don't necessarily stick around forever.
And you can't necessarily imagine what
your life [music] would look like down
the road. Things could change. I mean,
I'm definitely not going to become a
runner, but like that could happen for
someone. Not me, but maybe you. I think
I've definitively [music] learned that I
will never run again.

open your eyes.
Everyone out there,
give me a big clap over your head
if you can see your person
in your mind's eye, give me a big clap.
(Claps)
One more big clap.
Notice the technique.
Elbows locked on this man.
Michael Phelps would have been jealous
of that streamline.
Stand up, please.
Introduce yourself.
Person: I'm Ian.
OP: Ian, question for you.
Before you walked
in this room and sat down,
did you have any idea who I was
or what I was going to do?
Ian: No, actually, sorry.
OP: OK, that's cool,
nobody reads the agenda.
Totally fine.
Give me another clap.
I like that, right here,
you not only clap,
but threw in a little belly dance.
I reward extra credit.
She's hiding her name tag.
She's like, ""I'm giving
the mentalist nothing.""
What is your name?
Person: Oh, hi, I'm Nanjera.
OP: Nanjera? Stand up please.
Did I say that correctly, Nanjera?
Wonderful.
Give me another clap.
One more clap.
This man and I just locked eyes.
When we made eye contact,
he closed his eyes tightly.
(Laughter)
As if activating a camouflage shield
where if he doesn't see me,
would I still see him?
I still see you, Jeff Johnson,
stand up, please.
Give all three helpers
a round of applause.
(Applause)
Notice the question
and the way it was phrased.
Dead or alive?
Fifty-fifty, like flipping a coin.
All three of you, please.
I don't read minds,
I'm telling you the truth.
I read people.
Try not to react.
If the person you thought of is alive,
then their heart is beating
in their chest,
the room is getting warm,
like the blood flowing
through their veins,
they're happy, smiling,
alive, warming up.
Cold? You feel a shiver down your neck.
Clear cut, 100 percent,
Jeff Johnson, your person
is alive and well, am I right?
JJ: You're right.
OP: The boisterous smile,
the effervescence, 100 percent,
versus Ian, dead guy vibes
written all over this guy.
Is it a dead guy?
Ian: Yeah.
OP: Classic Ian, classic.
(Laughter)
Ian, focus on this --
Also, the lingering hands in pockets,
always indicator of another guy.
Guy-to-guy interaction. Is it a guy?
Ian: Yes.
OP: Of course it is.
If it's a female, hands in front
of the crotch, I don't know why.
(Laughter)
A few of you are going to get home,
and you see your husband like this,
and you're like, ""Who is she?""
(Laughter)
Ian, think of his first name,
think of his last name.
First name, last name.
Come back to me.
The first name, try to count the letters.
This doesn't make sense.
Listen to me.
This doesn't make sense.
He was confused when I asked
about the last name.
He tried to shield it, but I saw it.
Why was he confused?
Then I asked the first name,
count the letters.
It was too long.
Sit down if it's Alexander the Great.
Ian: What?
(Laughter and scattered applause)
You don't have to hold
the applause inside, TED.
You can let it out.
(Applause and cheers)
You've seen a taste of what I do.
And this is used primarily
for the purpose of entertainment.
But what I'd like to show you now
is how you could apply
the principles of my craft,
which is known as mentalism,
to your everyday lives.
At home, at work, in your relationships.
How would guessing a celebrity
out of a stranger's mind help you?
Well, frankly, it really can't.
(Laughter)
But I have a situation,
a scenario where knowing someone's name
would be incredibly valuable.
Let me paint a portrait.
You're at a party, you're at a work event,
you've walked up to somebody new,
you've looked them in the eye,
shaken their hands,
introduced yourselves to each other,
and right at that moment,
you realize that you have completely
forgotten the person's name
who just told it to you one second ago.
Raise your hand if you can share
this experience.
You raise your hand, too, you liar.
She's like, ""Not me, not me.""
I want to give you a superpower,
from this day forward,
where you will never, ever
forget the name of someone you just met.
Ever.
And how am I going to do this?
Using, can you guess?
Shampoo.
Didn't see that one coming, did you?
The back of every bottle of shampoo
is a masterclass in brilliant marketing.
Three words in the instructions:
lather, rinse, repeat.
Lather, makes your hair smell good;
rinse makes it clean;
repeat -- we've got to sell some product.
I want to repurpose that catchphrase
that each and every one
of you will remember
and take with you
for the rest of your days.
Listen. Repeat. Reply.
Say it with me, listen, repeat, reply.
Listen sounds like the most
obvious thing in the world.
Of course, listen to the name.
But that's where most of you falter.
At the moment the person
tells you the name,
you are actually not listening.
You are thinking about what
you're going to say back.
Do I know this person
or what am I going to say next?
Or a million other thoughts
that pop into your head.
It's not a memory issue.
You didn't forget the name,
you never knew it.
Imagine I give you a twig
and I tell you, write my name
in the sand at the beach.
And you try with the twig.
First wave washes it away.
But if I give you a thick branch,
you carve it in.
You repeat those letters.
It's going to take a whole lot
of waves until there's no trace.
So here's what each
of you is going to do.
When you meet the next person,
make your mind a blank
for all of two seconds.
When they say their name, truly listen.
And now repeat.
Everybody say it with me, repeat.
We are going to say their name
twice back to them, right?
Ashley, is that right?
Great to meet you Ashley.
This serves two purposes.
One, it kind of repetitively
ingrains it in our memory.
Second, you know how
to pronounce it correctly.
Nanjera? Am I saying that right, Nanjera?
See, there was a reason I did that.
Third, third: reply.
Listen, repeat?
Reply.
Reply is where we fully
cement the name in.
Here is how we do that,
I'll give you three examples.
First one, a compliment.
Everyone loves a good compliment, right?
""Ashley, those earrings,
I love those earrings, Ashley.""
Now she's Ashley with the earrings.
A visual indicator.
Next up, spelling.
""Do you spell that Ashley
with an EIGH or with an EY?
EY, of course, that's the right
spelling, Ashley, I knew.""
Or, third, a personal connection.
""Ashley, that's so funny.
My cousin’s married to Ashley.”
Is my cousin really married to Ashley?
Absolutely not, I'm a total liar.
(Laughter)
But none of you will forget
the name Ashley.
And neither will I.
And neither will we forget Nanjera,
after I said her name multiple times.
Nanjera, I think -- again, rouging
of the cheeks, little sweat.
Your person is alive also.
Nanjera: Correct.
OP: Now, what I do in my profession
is I take things that appear
to have limitless possibilities
and break them down.
People that are famous,
there are several, kind of, categories.
I'm going to say them quickly,
you don't have to nod,
but we had a conqueror,
let's call it a historical figure.
We have singers, movie stars,
athletes, comedians, politicians,
already registered a hit.
Too funny you did this.
Alright.
Shouldn't have smiled,
tighten it up, Nanjera.
(Laughter)
Three days ago,
I did a show in Dallas, Texas.
Dallas, Texas.
And the last person standing
thought of a singer.
It's always singers where this happens.
I got his singer correct
and he didn't sit down.
And do you know what he said to me?
I go, you know, why isn't he sitting down?
He goes, ""Oh yeah?
What song am I thinking of?""
(Laughter)
I'm like, buddy, this is not Netflix.
(Laughter)
Always singers.
Tell us all,
who, in your mind, is sitting
across from you, having dinner?
You're on the edge of your seat.
What's their name?
Nanjera: Bob Dylan.
OP: I couldn't hear you.
Nanjera: Bob Dylan.
OP: Can I ask you a question?
I always like this.
Everyone, listen to me.
I call this the grass is greener approach.
I can always see it
when someone's eyes shift.
She goes, ""Mm, I like Bob Dylan,
but I actually had
someone else in my mind.""
You thought of someone else.
It's in the back of your head,
but you just shifted.
Can you tell me --
Folks --
(Laughter)
This is not my first rodeo.
(Laughter)
Who was the first person you thought of?
(Laughter)
Tell us.
Nanjera: Trevor Noah.
OP: Ooh. It's not a singer.
Ooh.
Don't ever doubt me again, TED,
don't you ever doubt me again.
(Applause and cheers)
Jeff.
Do you know what the most common
question I get at the end of a show is?
Other than, of course, ""How do you do it,""
is, ""Aren't you afraid
of getting it wrong?""
That's what I get asked,
because people understand
that there is risk involved in what I do.
This is not sleight-of-hand
card tricks that work every time.
And so the answer is,
yeah, of course, of course I am.
You know what?
Because what's fascinating to me
is people can feel the element of risk.
And I think the number one
factor in success,
both on stage and in every
facet of my life,
is an unshakable belief that it will work.
It's self-fulfilling.
And in this case, it's not a belief
that I'm going to guess your person.
Been there, done that.
I don't plateau, Jeff, I peak.
So I am not going to read your mind.
I want to empower someone
in this room to do it instead.
This Frisbee --
(Laughter)
Was purchased on Amazon Prime,
free two-day shipping, 87 cents.
It has a 1.5-star review.
(Laughter)
This is literally the worst
Frisbee in the world.
(Laughter)
Please, sir, grab that.
Tell me your first name.
Person: Dylan.
OP: That's correct.
(Laughter)
Stand up, Dylan.
The Frisbee is made out
of mesh, everybody.
Which means if it hits you
in the face, it will not hurt.
But it will hurt your pride
if this goes viral on TED Talks later.
Everyone hands up in defensive posture.
Dylan, close your eyes so you can't
even try to aim this piece of junk.
Throw it.
Someone catch.
Give it a throw, please go.
Oh, my God, is that far?
Mike runner, run, run, run.
Stand up, stand up!
(Applause)
Please stand up.
What is your name?
Did you say Brett?
Person: Yeah, Brett.
OP: Have you ever met or spoken
a word to Jeff Johnson before?
Brett: I actually haven't.
OP: OK, maybe more networking
at the next breakout session.
(Laughter)
Please, Brett, come on up.
Give him a huge round of applause,
make your way up, Brett.
Two Ts, I like the way you roll, Brett.
Not going to forget
that name, are you now?
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
Brett, I’m bringing you front and center.
Let's adjust this to the height
my wife wishes I had.
(Laughter)
She is watching this now live
and saying ""That's true.""
Brett, here's what you're going to do.
I'm going to ask you in a moment --
Have you ever spoken
to me a word in your life?
Brett: I haven't.
OP: He seemed happy
about that, that was weird.
I'm going to ask him in a moment
to close his eyes.
You need to believe it
in order to achieve it.
When you close your eyes,
I am going to ask Jeff to uncap a marker.
And you're going to write the person.
Very important, Jeff,
you thought of one person,
is that correct?
Jeff: That's right.
OP: Because, you know,
Nanjera is like, having dinner.
She's like, load it up,
let's get a six top.
Brett, close your eyes.
His eyes are closed.
Brett, keep your eyes closed.
Jeff, open up your marker, please.
As big as you can, so we can't see it,
write down the first and last name
of the person you are imagining
sitting down to dinner with.
Brett, open your eyes.
You have to believe it
in order to achieve it.
Look, not into his eyes,
look into his soul.
And when I snap my fingers,
tell him, who is he having dinner with?
Brett: Barack Obama.
OP: Turn it around!
Show everybody, show everybody.
(Cheers and applause)
Thank you, Brett.
(Cheers and applause)
I am Oz Pearlman,
thank you very much, everybody.",,
kNelNGmQ4YM,"One of my colleagues asked me to analyze
a bunch of brains of psychopathic
killers. Some of the brains that I've
studied are people you know about. When
I get the brains, I don't know what I'm
looking at. You know, it's a blind
experiment. They give me normal people
and everything. So, I've looked at about
70 of these and came up and saw a number
of pieces of data. So, we look at these
sorts of things theoretically on the
basis of genetics and brain damage and
the interaction with environment and
exactly how that machine works. So we're
interested in exactly where in the brain
and what's the most important part of
the brain. So how you end up with a
psychopath and a killer depends on
exactly when the damage occurs. Every
one of them I looked at who was a
murderer and was a serial killer had
damage to their orbital cortex which is
right above the eyes the orbits and also
the anterior part of the temple. So
there's this pattern that every one of
them had but they all were a little
different too. They had other sorts of
brain damage. The key thing is that the
major violence genes is called the MA
gene. And there's a variant of this gene
that is in the normal population. Some
of you have this. And it's sex length.
It's on the X chromosome. And so in this
way, you can only get it from your
mother.
And in fact, this is probably why mostly
men, boys are psychopathic killers are
very aggressive because, you know, the
daughter can get one X from the father,
one X from the mother. kind of diluted
out. But for a son could only get the X
chromosome from his mother.",,
Qej_ZzMV5_0,"Jamie Wood: I knew that I had
had a truly wretched boss
the day I learned I needed surgery.
So I was 26 years old,
and they were telling me this surgery
might mean I can't have kids.
So I was devastated.
But my strongest emotion
was this surge of excitement,
because this meant five weeks
away from a boss
who had made my life miserable.
And just to be clear,
I have two wonderful kids,
and part of why I'm here today
is they have had more
than their fair [share]
of terrible bosses,
and they're very early in their career.
Christopher Bell: Jamie and I
run a company
that's in the business of trying
to crack this bad-boss problem.
And it's not easy.
You want to know why?
OK, let's play a game.
Show of hands.
How many of you have ever had a boss
who made you feel not good?
Made you feel disrespected --
and keep them up --
disrespected, incompetent.
Look around.
Almost all of us have had
these kinds of people
with institutional power in our lives.
And for you, that might not
have even been a boss.
That might have been a teacher or a coach.
Just someone who's really bad
at being in power,
who gets to have power over you.
JW: So we, Dr. Bell and I.
collect research on this.
So a recent Harris poll
found that 71 percent of employees
have had what
they would call a “toxic boss.”
And over half of them
have had nightmares about this boss.
(Laughter)
And you know how that goes.
You're out with friends,
you're thinking about your boss.
You're home with your family,
you're thinking about your boss.
And now, you’re lying awake at 3am,
and you're thinking,
""I need to quit.""
And that's an expensive
problem for businesses.
Not just in the lost productivity
and the turnover costs,
but in all the brilliant, creative ideas
that never rise to the surface
because people
were too afraid to speak up.
So why is this so widespread?
Part of the problem is that when we rise
to positions of power,
we fall prey to what
we call “power blindness.”
We lose sight of how it feels
to be the one with less power.
And we lose sight
of how our tone of voice
or the quick dismissal of an idea
can ruin someone's day.
And just by virtue of our title,
people stop telling us the truth.
They don't give us the tough feedback,
they don't even disagree with us.
They laugh at our stupid jokes.
And this creates a massive
reality distortion.
And I fell into that reality distortion.
I fell into that real hard.
So fast forward from my surgery story,
and now I'm a boss.
I'm 32 years old,
and I'm leading a training team
at the University
of California at Berkeley.
I have eight direct reports,
we're gelling as a team,
we're putting out all sorts
of creative training programs.
And you know what?
I'm a good boss.
One day, one of my employees
comes into my office,
and she says she wants to talk.
But she's crying so hard, she can't speak.
So of course I'm concerned.
But I'm also a little irritated
because I have this budget report due
at the end of the day,
and I've got to get back to it.
When she finally gathers
herself enough to speak,
she tells me
that she has been working so hard
to deliver this training program,
and she's invited me multiple times
to come and observe,
and I've been too busy to show up.
And more than that,
she feels like I play favorites.
So now I'm thinking,
""Holy crap!
I'm the wretched boss!""
And that's power blindness in action.
CB: You want to talk
about power blindness?
OK, let me tell you a story.
I'm a storyteller.
I'm also a professional consultant,
I'm a professor,
and I make people call me Dr. Bell.
Now that’s not just ego, I have a reason.
See, if there were 100 people
in a room with PhDs,
statistically speaking,
seven of those would be Black.
And of those seven,
four of them would be women.
Black men make up
three percent of all PhDs.
A Black man in America
is more likely to be sent to prison
than have a PhD.
So I make people call me Dr. Bell.
For the Black men who will never
get to become a doctor.
But I also got that from my dad.
See, when I was really little,
I skipped a bunch of grades,
and so I was always younger
than everybody else around me,
and I didn't really fit in,
and I didn't know why.
And one day I'm hanging out
with my dad, just me and him.
And I asked him about it, and he says,
""Listen, son,
you are smart and you are Black,
and that is always going to make
people uncomfortable.
And they're not going to know
what to do with that,
so they're going to blame you.""
And I put that on like armor
because I needed it to survive.
And today,
when people are afraid of the power
that comes with that armor,
well, then they call me
intimidating or arrogant,
just like my dad said they would.
And of course, my own brain goes,
""Well, you ain't got to like me.
I like me enough for both of us.""
(Laughter)
I armor up.
(Laughter)
But that armor can make me blind
to the fact that it is also
covered in spikes.
And it can keep people
from wanting to get close to me,
even when I might want them to.
Like now, I manage our company staff,
and I need to know how I'm landing
with these young people who I adore.
I don't want to be a bad boss.
And so sometimes that means
I have to take that armor off
and be a little vulnerable,
even if that makes me uncomfortable,
and it makes me uncomfortable.
But that's OK, there's lots to learn
when you feel uncomfortable.
And I bet you have your own
kinds of armor, too.
And I'm not telling you don't wear it
because sometimes we need it.
But that armor is heavy.
And sometimes we have
to be willing to take it off,
especially if we want
to really see and be seen
by the people we're trying to lead.
JW: So my sobbing employee,
I failed to see her.
But she saw me.
She saw me a little too well.
When she gave me that feedback,
I felt this gut punch of shame,
and I want to say I owned it right away.
But I didn't.
I did what, let's be honest,
so many of us do
when we get tough feedback.
I blocked that shame.
I built walls around me.
I built a fortress of solitude.
Just me and my self-justifications.
Well, it was the workplace,
so it was a cubicle of solitude.
(Laughter)
And from inside here,
my employee, she's the problem.
Her accusations of favoritism?
I had a logical explanation
for all of that.
So inside my cubicle,
what's problematic about that is,
outside, all sorts of bad things
might be happening.
People might be upset,
feeling demoralized,
but they can't get into these walls.
So inside, I'm feeling just fine.
I'm a good boss.
But of course, you can't be a good boss
and be that disconnected.
So how do I get out of here?
It starts with a healthy dose
of honest self-reflection.
CB: Meet the mirror.
(Laughter)
Do you want to know
if you have power blindness?
We're going to do
a little self-reflection.
Now I’m not talking about one of these
little compact mirrors, by the way.
People say that all the time.
""Oh, I have a mirror.
And I self-reflect all the time.""
This is for touch ups.
This is not a self-reflection, OK?
You need a mirror.
Like a big old hallway mirror.
Like a “I’m going out on Saturday night,
I'm trying to check myself out"" mirror.
You have to be able
to see your whole self.
When you ask yourself three very simple,
very important questions.
Question number one:
What kind of armor are you wearing?
And what does that armor give you?
And what does that armor cost you?
JW: So when my employee
gave me the feedback,
that armor was protecting my ego,
but it cost me the ability to be a good,
supportive, humane boss.
Question number two.
Because of your position,
people are going to be afraid
to tell you stuff.
So ask yourself:
What might people be afraid to tell me?
In my case, I sometimes got
to take off my spiky armor
because I don't want to unintentionally
push away people I might care about.
And question number three,
the most important question of all.
Once you've thought about all that,
what am I going to do differently?
JW: So eventually I got it,
and I started to show up
for my employee's trainings
so I could give her meaningful feedback
and positive recognition.
And I started to carve out time
to take her to lunch
and get to know her as a person.
And not just that,
I also reached out
to the other people on my team
who I hadn't spent as much time with,
and I got to know them
as full people, too.
And I'll tell you, that significantly
deepened the trust,
the ability for us to collaborate
as an entire team.
CB: And that's how you learn.
That's how you avoid becoming a bad boss.
Being a leader means
you have an ethical obligation
to break that bad-boss cycle
and to see the advantages
your power gives you.
We have this whole industry
in this culture
around how to ""survive your boss.""
No one should have to survive us.
(Laughter)
The power to break that bad-boss
cycle is in our hands.
We just have to be brave enough
to look in the mirror.
Thank you.
(Applause)",,
Hn1szUVbi-E,"Mass psychoggenic illness, otherwise
known as mass hysteria, is the rapid
spread of real physical symptoms from
one person to the other, but those
symptoms don't seem to have any organic
cause. So, you've got a limp, but your
X-ray is normal. Or you've got
neurological symptoms, but your MRI
doesn't show anything. Medically, these
symptoms shouldn't be happening. But
then they begin to spread from person to
person. But it's not random.
Uh the spread of the contagion tends to
be a function of how connected the
victims are to each other. So students
at a small town high school or workers
on a factory floor or even nuns in a
convent. Why does it happen?
There's usually some sort of underlying
stress or trauma affecting the people
involved. Like for example, in the fall
of 2001 when a mystery rash broke out in
grade schools around the country, the
rash would pass from student to student
during the day in the school, but then
often disappear when the kid went home
at night and then it would reappear the
next day and begin spreading all over
again. Uh tests showed no bacteria, no
virus, no toxic exposure that would
explain it. Turns out what may have been
happening is that it was fear of toxic
exposure that caused the contagion. In
fact, the mystery rash began on the very
day that the news reported that a man in
Florida had been diagnosed with anthrax
just weeks after they began appearing in
envelopes after September 11th in
people's mailboxes. It's not just
medical, it's not just psychological,
it's social, it's cultural, it's about
all of us. I think we all need to start
learning how to believe in mass hysteria
because while it is very rare, it is
also very real. So say neurologists,
psychoanalysts, sociologists. So says
the NIH. And it's a very specific type
of contagion that says a lot about how
we're connected as people.",,
ojfZMid20iA,"Since I was little, I always loved nature.
I always loved the feeling
of being in a forest.
For me, the forest is more
valuable than gold.
My name is Claudia Vega
and I work in the Peruvian Amazon.
I'm studying mercury contamination
due to artisanal gold mining
in Madre de Dios.
I think people are not aware
that sometimes the gold that you buy
maybe is poisoning the rainforest
in the Amazon or other tropical areas.
About 20 percent of the gold
produced in the world
come from artisanal gold mining.
It's not that small.
And when you say artisanal,
it's not because it's natural.
It's called artisanal because
they don't use fancy equipment.
They have a very, like, rustic way.
People have been doing that
since the gold rush in California.
They were using mercury.
So the technique hasn't advanced
that much since then.
Mercury is used because
it's an easy way to extract the gold.
So what the miners do is,
the gold is like, in the sandy form,
and it's usually
in the sediment of the rivers.
They put mercury,
the mercury binds with gold,
then they have the amalgam,
which is a mix of gold and mercury
and then they burn the amalgam.
And then the mercury
just evaporates to the air.
And they got the gold.
When they're doing the mixing with gold,
some of the mercury goes into the river.
It's easy to evaporate,
you don't have to heat it,
it goes to the air,
and it can be transported
like, long distance.
This happens mainly in the tropics
and is the biggest anthropogenic
source of mercury on the planet.
Around 1,400 tons of mercury annually
is released into the environment
because of artisanal gold mining.
It's an international concern.
And it's not because it harms
just the place where it's used.
For example, there are even
very high levels of mercury in the whales,
in the beluga whales, in the Arctic.
In Madre de Dios,
about 130,000 hectares has been deforested
because of artisanal gold mining.
It is a big operation,
you can see huge areas
of rainforest just deforested.
It looked like a desert with mining ponds.
There are artificial lakes.
And in the middle of a lot of desert,
there's no trees, there's no animals.
It looks like the moon, kind of,
because there's no vegetation.
Mercury is an element we cannot destroy.
It is a potent neurotoxin.
It can affect the neurosystem,
it also can give you headaches,
can give you problems with memory.
It can give you insomnia.
It can harm children during pregnancy,
you could have a baby
who will have learning disabilities.
Depending on how much is exposed,
it can even have malformation.
Mercury is called the silent toxin
because it takes a while to show effects.
Minamata Bay in Japan is a more
iconic case of mercury poisoning.
In 1932 there was a company
that was releasing mercury into the bay.
It took about 25 years
to show the effects in people.
About 1,000 people died,
and until now they have certified
like 10,000 people that were affected.
So people didn't know
they were being intoxicated
and they didn't feel it.
But at the end, they had
the symptoms and people died.
WHO says that mercury
is one of the top ten chemicals
that are a major concern
for public health.
Centro de Innovación Científica Amazónica,
which is Amazonian Center
for Scientific Innovation,
we implemented the first mercury lab
in the Peruvian Amazon,
and it's in the middle of the rainforest.
It's in the middle of the jungle.
We produce science.
[We] also communicate the science
to people that are not scientists
in a way that they can have information
to make better decision.
We work with miners and also explain
to them the dangers of mercury
and with Indigenous people,
also explain to them
how they can avoid being exposed.
And also we work with politicians
so they can base
their decisions on science.
Fish is the main source of protein
for Indigenous people in the Amazon.
They are exposed
to very high levels of mercury
through consuming contaminated fish.
They have one of the highest
levels reported right now.
So one thing that we do with them,
we explain to them
that they have to choose safer fish.
Sometimes it's very difficult
because you don't have
the right answer for them.
I mean, they're in their home
and then strange people come,
telling them that what
they are eating is poisoned.
But I think information is power,
and having the right information
may make you do the right decision.
So we insist on that:
give the information
and repeat the information.
Some of the miners tell us,
""I have been doing this
for 30 years, so I'm good.""
I asked them like, ""Do you sleep?
Do you have headaches?
Do you forget things more often?""
And also mercury sometimes
can increase the chance
of having cardiovascular disease.
So maybe some of the people
have high pressure
and they don't know why.
It could be because of mercury.
And some of them are changing
for a more responsible way of mining.
Some other miners, maybe they know,
but they don't care
because they need money.
And gold is money.
There are not incentives
to produce mercury-free gold.
People just buy gold, they don't care,
there's no good traceability system.
So I think as a consumer
or as a mediator of gold trade,
we have to care about where
the gold is coming from.
Sometimes we use things
and we don't even know
how much impact they have in the world.
At the end, we have
one health, one planet,
and everything is connected.
When you are affecting the environment,
you can affect the animals' health
and then human health, too.
So for me, my dream is like,
people can see the value of the forest.
It's actually doing something for us.
It's producing air, it's producing water.
That's more valuable than gold.
I know gold is valuable,
but you cannot eat it,
you cannot breathe it,
and you cannot drink it.",,
6OWzmfJVloo,"When I was a kid,
I remember feeling terrified
during classes
when the teacher would launch
a stealth attack
called oral pop quiz.
Oh, I can still feel the sweat in my hands
and how fast my heart was beating.
And I remember also how relieved I was
when my name was not called out that day.
I was deeply afraid of looking stupid
or not having the right answer.
And it felt like the entirety
of my character was being assessed
in those dreadful five minutes.
When I look back,
I realize that feeling
was not only present
during the pop quizzes.
It was present the entire time.
So if I didn't understand something,
instead of asking, I used to think,
""Just shut your mouth
and you can ask a friend later.""
This fear of looking inadequate
or below average
haunted me for a long, long time.
And it took me years to realize
that I was not alone in that feeling.
It turns out, many grown ups
feel like that too.
In April 26 of 1986,
a team of terrified, tired,
overworked engineers
were trying to desperately solve a problem
with reactor number four
of the Chernobyl nuclear plant
after a disastrous emergency exercise.
When approaching the director,
they were received
with yelling and threats.
Now, fast forward to around June of 2018,
and after seeing many
of his coworkers burning out
due to an overwhelming work schedule,
and also knowing that this could lead
to potentially fatal errors,
Ed Pierson,
one of the senior managers at Boeing
for the 737 Max project,
decided to break the silence.
Go to the bosses, straight to the top.
Nobody listened.
And almost a year later,
more than 300 people died
in two separate 737 Max accidents.
Ed also mentioned later on
how stifling the culture was,
and it was silencing most
of the concerned employees.
When working with a client
a few years ago,
I remember seeing on the wall
an impeccable record
of health and safety awards.
I saw four years in a row
they won the award,
but nothing after that.
So I asked the CEO what happened.
To which he only replied,
""Oh, we learned a lesson.""
So his management team became
so obsessed with winning the award
that the most important
thing they could do
was to check all the boxes.
So the following year,
many employees were incapacitated
or even died as a consequence
of several workplace accidents.
When talking to the employees,
many of them said they could not
report nonconformities to the managers,
otherwise they would be ostracized
or labeled as inefficient.
So they took the only route possible.
Fake the numbers to win the award.
See these stories, they all have
something in common.
Like me as a kid,
these people were afraid of speaking up.
And this is a clear symptom
of a workplace lacking
what scientists call psychological safety.
Psychological safety,
as Professor Amy Edmondson
very well puts it,
is the belief that one
will not be punished or humiliated
for speaking up with ideas,
suggestions, concerns, even mistakes.
So as an organizational psychologist,
it fascinates me the science
behind this concept
and how easy it is to notice
the importance of it.
As a professor in higher education,
I am constantly concerned
with creating an environment
where curiosity has a free flow
and my students have
a safe space to be creative.
And as a consultant,
working with large-scale
organizational transformation,
I constantly try to be
the voice advocating
towards more psychologically
safe workplaces.
Now, I want you to try imagining working
in a team where everyone has a voice.
Your colleagues take their turn speaking,
and more importantly,
people actually listen to one another.
They understand your talking points,
they address them,
ask for more explanation.
Imagine you walk out of a meeting
and the people there understood
you were only talking about ideas.
And because of that,
they don't take personal offense.
That is what working in a psychologically
safe team would look like.
There is something very, very powerful
about knowing that you can talk
in a safe space.
Also, knowing that people will listen
to your ideas and consider them.
Yet in a recent survey,
workers confided
that they did not feel safe
speaking up at their workplaces.
They were afraid of being
labeled as dissenters
or receiving negative feedback,
or even lose their jobs.
Now think about it for a second,
what are the consequences of that?
How many ideas were discarded?
How many suggestions never happened?
How much innovation was lost?
How many lives could have been saved
if only people felt safe enough
to speak up and ask questions?
Now some people might say,
""Oh yeah, I do that all the time.
Don't worry about me.
I ask my team always,
'Do you want to say something?'""
That is not that simple.
There's a little misconception
about how this works.
To foster a psychologically
safe environment,
leaders must walk the walk
and talk the talk.
Sometimes they are great with words,
but they forget to act on it.
So, for example,
let's assume that a certain leader asks
for their teams to speak up.
But when listening to new ideas,
different ideas,
they instantly become defensive
or very territorial
about their own position.
Well, they are sending
a powerful implicit message:
""Just shut up.""
I call this the whack-a-mole culture.
You know that fun arcade game
where kids must whack
the moles in the head
to score some points?
It works the same way in cultures
where fear is predominant
and safety is scarce.
Employees voice their opinion
and in exchange, you get
a whack in the head.
Sometimes even in public.
Well, I guarantee you,
after the second or third whack,
they have learned their lesson.
Do not speak up.
Now imagine hundreds
or thousands of employees
thinking like that.
So why does this matter?
Why [is] having this culture 
of fear not good for you?
Well, psychological safety has proven
to be the most powerful predictor
for team success.
There is robust empirical
scientific evidence
that it enhances team performance,
creativity, team learning,
team confidence and synergy.
And that is just to mention a few.
To put that to the test,
I did an experiment with one
of my courses at the university.
One of the components
of this course is a big group project
that students must present
at the end of the semester,
and it's one that requires a lot
of creativity and some risk taking.
So I asked them,
""What is the thing
that scares you the most?
What are you afraid of?""
After getting many, many answers,
I could narrow down to one single factor.
The fear of getting bad grades.
So I proposed them something.
I said, ""Listen, how about
I will personally guarantee you
that as long as you can deliver me
something that is your own,
it's creative, it's not plagiarized,
no matter how bold the idea is,
I'll give you a fair grade above average.""
They did not believe me.
They were laughing.
They thought it was some kind of trap.
But once they realized
I was being serious,
I could feel the tension just fading away.
And the results were amazing.
Not only better projects,
but also more fun,
more openness, more
willingness to go the extra mile.
They had a safety net.
So creating this environment
where failing is not judged harshly
and approaching learning as a laboratory
where you can make
mistakes and fail better,
it's the pillar of human development.
Of course, fostering
such a positive environment
means understanding a few caveats.
So it's important to highlight
what psychological safety is not.
You can share your ideas, for example,
but that doesn't mean you get a free pass
to say anything you want at any time.
It means being open, yes,
the team will consider
all the plans and alternatives,
but bear in mind, that might come
with some level of discomfort to you.
It's expected.
It doesn't mean everybody will hug
and be best friends forever.
To put it simply, psychological safety
is about courage and vulnerability,
and it's also about shaping culture
and designing systems
that will be conducive of healthy
and effective behaviors.
So what to do then?
How can we nurture psychological safety
and help others around us?
When you find yourself
in a leadership position,
whether this is your own family,
your community,
your organization, school or church,
you have to make sure
that your team feels safe.
Fostering this environment
requires ideas, yes,
but more importantly, your actions.
Now, I can suggest you
three big actions that can help you.
First, remember, leadership matters.
People will follow the lead
and mimic the behaviors that are displayed
from the people running the show.
So cultivating healthy,
positive behaviors at the top
will send the right message
to the people around you.
That includes, for example,
preventing dominant personalities
from monopolizing your meetings
and ensuring that a good tone
prevails throughout the conversation.
It's also a good idea to steer
away from pointing fingers.
That means treating mistakes
as learning opportunities
and shifting questions from ""Who did it?""
to ""How did this happen,
and how can we prevent that
from happening in the future?""
Especially in scenarios
where the system is far from ideal.
We've all been there.
You know the old saying, a bad system
will beat a good person every time?
Well, it stands true.
So address the system
without sacrificing the individuals.
Number two, observe.
One of the most effective ways
of assessing psychological safety
is to attend a meeting
or watch informal group conversation.
I remember one time [with] a client,
I was sitting in the back of a room,
just watching a meeting.
It was one of the many team meetings
that we had in that organization.
The leader was up front
laying out the big plans,
the rollout for the big initiative
and he would constantly stop and say,
""Do you have any questions?
Do you want to say something?""
The room was silent.
Dead silent.
Forty-five minutes in
and there was a slide, Q&A.
The room was still silent.
Well, there was one question
from one person.
""OK, then, if we don't have
any questions, can we go?""
This particular team had the highest level
of resistance to change
in the entire organization.
And this is why I was sitting
in that meeting in the first place.
Many focus groups later,
and those employees told me
they knew better than that.
Even when disagreeing with a boss's plans,
they wouldn't dare say anything
because he was known to target
practice the ""troublemakers.""
So be observant.
And finally, aim for consistency.
After many years helping teams,
I've discovered that encouraging
open dialogue does not happen overnight.
And it does not happen
because you told them to speak up.
Shaping that environment
takes time, takes effort,
and most of all, consistency.
To do that, you must, whenever you can,
increase granularity with your people.
Have more one-on-one conversations,
at least at the beginning,
and then you can encourage them
to say what they need to say
during the group meetings.
Like the example
of the whack-a-mole culture,
the opposite is also true.
So after learning through role modeling
and observation that your meetings
are indeed a safe space,
people will gladly participate,
ask, comment and suggest.
Now I know most examples I gave you
come from corporate experience,
but this concept also applies
to our own families.
Think of how many children and teenagers
wish they had a more
psychologically safe household
so they could discuss their anguishes,
their afflictions, their insecurities.
This open channel helps us, parents,
to better understand
what's going on with our kids,
and it helps our kids by letting them know
they have a safe port to ask questions
whenever they are confused.
The benefits of psychological safety
go beyond organizational teams.
It helps people to nourish
better human interactions.
And if there is one thing we all know now,
it's how important meaningful
human connections are
to our mental health.
So let's go out there and create
more psychologically safe workplaces,
families and communities.",,

2ZIfqLDG_Qs,"Our modern world was built on fuel.
History has been determined
by who finds, who controls
and who burns the dominant
fuel of the age.
So the past makes sense
when you look at it
wearing fuel-tinted glasses.
And these are not just
a really great fashion accessory
for this year’s Fyre Festival.
They are, in fact, essential
safety equipment for our leaders,
as they seek to shape history.
In the 1970s, for example,
the oil cartel OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia,
tried to cut off the supply
of oil to the United States.
Caused an instant panic,
a recession within months.
Trump was 27 when those lines
of cars snaked around the block.
Putin was 21. Xi was 20.
Our leaders understand, in their bones,
their power comes from fuel.
But now, we're in the midst
of the next great energy transition.
So who will control the future
of clean energy?
Who will be the Saudi Arabia
of this transition?
Well, through fuel-tinted glasses,
the answer seems obvious.
It's whoever controls the copper,
the lithium, the graphite, the cobalt,
the rare earths, the critical
minerals that we need.
But our fuel-tinted glasses are broken,
because this is the first transition
not to another dominant fuel,
but to a technology,
and that changes everything.
Now I've spent a lot of time
thinking about what this means.
Our team is building
one of the largest distributed
renewable energy utilities for Africa.
CrossBoundary Energy uses on-site
solar batteries and wind to bring cheaper,
cleaner and more reliable
power to businesses,
and CrossBoundary Access uses the same
technologies to bring first-time power
to some of the 600 million people
living on this continent without it.
And here is what I have learned
at the silicon face of this transition.
Unlike fuel, technology
is less existential.
It's more circular. It's more fungible,
and it's more abundant.
So I can use one of our projects
to explain how this works.
This is Tolagnaro in Madagascar.
It's a remote town of 55,000 people,
next to a major critical minerals mine.
Power for the mine and the community,
until recently, came from heavy fuel
oil generators on the mine site.
Now, CrossBoundary powers the mine
with a renewable energy microgrid
made up of solar, wind and batteries.
Soon, we hope that we will be able
to phase out the generators altogether.
Now, let me tell you a story.
Imagine two cartels.
One is real, OPEC,
which seeks to control the price of oil.
The other is an imaginary alliance
of the major miners
of copper and lithium today.
Chile, China and Australia.
Now if you want to run a good cartel,
everyone knows you need
to have a great acronym.
And so let’s call it the “pisco sour,
Peking duck, Foster’s” cartel,
or PPF for short.
Now let's imagine that each cartel,
OPEC and PPF, seeks to cut off the supply
of their respective commodity
to the rest of the world.
In Tolagnaro, before
our energy transition,
this would have caused an instant crisis.
Without oil, the lights in the community
go out and the mine shuts down.
But after the transition,
nothing much changes in Tolagnaro.
And that's because in a fuel-based world,
constant supply of fuel is existential.
But in a technology-based world
without a constant supply of lithium,
your old lithium batteries keep working.
You don't need a constant supply
of new copper for your copper wires
to keep conducting electricity.
You do not require
a constant supply of new materials
just to survive.
But technology gets even better than that,
because it is also more circular.
Approximately zero percent of the energy
from oil can be recycled.
You burn it, it's gone.
But we don't burn technology ...
we use it.
And so over 90 percent of renewable
energy technologies can be recycled.
That wind turbine I showed you earlier
is actually a refurbished turbine
shipped to Madagascar from Italy.
And it works buono.
Although it gesticulates
more than our technical team
initially expected.
(Laughter)
By 2050, there could be
so much recycled supply
that demand for new input materials
could actually begin to decrease.
But it gets better than that,
because technology is also more fungible.
Now, I'm not actually
talking about mushrooms here,
but the effect is magic,
because almost every input
into this energy transition
can be substituted
for another abundant material.
Copper can be replaced by aluminium.
Cobalt can be replaced,
in batteries, by iron,
and those substitutions have already
happened when, temporarily, prices spiked.
So even without access
to a specific critical mineral,
the power of fungibility means
that you can continue to grow.
Now, hopefully, you're beginning
to feel somewhat convinced
that demand for new material will be
fundamentally different in this transition
because it is less existential,
more circular, more fungible,
and those things together
mean that it is more flexible.
It is more elastic.
But we do still have a lot
of energy transitioning left to do.
So we do need new supply.
And so here is my final
piece of good news.
The materials that we need
for this energy transition are abundant.
First, we need less stuff.
From now until 2050, we need to extract,
every year, around 230 million tonnes
of end-use materials.
So it sounds like a lot.
But every year, currently, we extract
over eight billion tonnes of coal.
Every year, we extract
five billion tonnes of oil
and three billion tonnes
of natural gas, every single year,
just to fuel our existing energy system.
So that 230 million looks manageable.
Now we are going to need
more of material like copper,
lithium, graphite, cobalt.
But this is the second point
of relative abundance.
We've got plenty of this stuff.
When geologists estimate
the likely resource,
they show that it easily
exceeds our projected demand.
Even rare earths are not rare.
They were called rare because they were
rarely found in their pure form.
They were always found
with another material.
So sure, they're rare,
but they're rare in the same way
that Bert is rare without Ernie.
But is oil very different?
Our identified resource of oil
is actually pretty abundant
relative to demand as well.
And our identified reserves of oil
are held, similarly to critical minerals,
in a very concentrated set of hands.
So what is different?
Well, two things.
One, the resource
that we have identified of oil
is the result of searching for it
intensively for over 100 years.
And we know that oil in general
is quite rare in the Earth's crust.
We know that most critical minerals
are actually geologically abundant
in the Earth's crust,
and we've really only just begun exploring
for many of them at scale.
So it's extremely likely
that if we try, we can diversify.
But second, if we're confronted
with the behavior of a PPF-style cartel,
that angry kangaroo who I think
maybe was a little bit drunk ...
the elasticity of demand gives us the time
and the leverage that we need to break
the cartel or diversify our supply.
Now, there will be short-term
mismatches between supply and demand,
but control really matters
when supply is scarce
and demand is inelastic.
When supply is abundant
and demand is elastic,
control will always be temporary.
Here's one final piece of evidence
that can tie all of this together.
Can you name me a successful
cartel for an energy-transition mineral?
Have you, for instance,
heard of these famous copper cartels,
the Secrétan Copper Syndicate,
the Amalgamated Copper Company,
the Copper Exporters Association,
the Copper Exporters Incorporated
and the not particularly creatively named
International Copper Cartel.
(Laughter)
These are all real cartels,
and they all failed,
because when supply is abundant
and demand is elastic,
a cartel has the lifespan
of your average
""Game of Thrones"" character.
(Laughter)
There will not be an OPEC for renewables.
OK, fine.
But won't there be a Saudi Arabia
of manufacturing in this transition?
Well, no, at least not
for the same reasons.
Because manufacturing
is effectively abundant,
your ability to manufacture does not
constrain my ability to manufacture.
It's not zero-sum.
Nobody can stop you
from making solar panels.
Now building, being good at building
and making things creates wealth,
and wealth can lead to power.
But in this transition,
it matters so much less what you have
and so much more what you do.
The great nations of tomorrow
will not be those that focus
on controlling materials
and constraining the growth of others.
The great nations of tomorrow
will be those that focus
on their comparative advantage.
Identify and unlock the resources
that we'll all need.
Invent, build and manufacture
the technology that we'll all need,
and then sell it
at great prices, terrific prices --
(Laughter)
to the rest of the world.
That's what policymakers should focus on,
not annexing another source
of not particularly rare earths.
The leaders we need now are explorers ...
not exploiters.
They are builders, not worriers.
And they are innovators, not conquerors.
So let's take off
those fuel-tinted glasses together.
Who will control the future
of clean energy?
Well, the answer is nobody.
And the answer can be everybody.
Because the future of energy
is not controlled.
It's shared.
It's not extracted, it's built,
and it can belong to all of us.
Thank you.

2Y3IjmFERcM,"I want to argue with that when it comes
to living a satisfying and meaningful
life, agency is actually much more
important than the things we usually
think about as critical to success, like
intelligence and hard work, both of
which are next to useless if misapplied,
and which are becoming less and less
important as we increasingly outsource
them to machines. I want to share some
of the tactics I've learned for becoming
more agentic. First, assume everything
is learnable. Learning to be more
optimistic or curious. I think most
traits that people treat as fixed are
actually quite learnable if you both
believe that they are and put the same
kind of effort into learning them that
you would anything else. Second, court
rejection. We spend our lives carefully
avoiding it. But if you're only aiming
for things you get, you're doing
yourself a disservice. In fact,
sometimes you have to aim for things
that feel unreasonable to make sure your
instinct about what's reasonable is
right. Last time I was applying for a
job, I told a couple people, ""I'm
thinking about starting an organization
much like your own. Can I run yours
instead?""
A little delusional maybe. But the thing
is, sometimes delusional works. Third,
seek real feedback.
Pretty much every one of us has
something holding us back that we're
completely blind to and that's obvious
to other people.
Don't you want to know what that is? The
single best way to find out is to give
people away to tell you anonymously.
I know that might sound scary. It was to
me at first, but it can also be
exhilarating. No matter how stuck you
are, if you can learn to locate the
doors hidden within you, you can unlock
inconceivable
kinds of freedom.",,
