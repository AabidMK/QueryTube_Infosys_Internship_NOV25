2XWGxVuOwJQ,"Alaska Natives don't
need to see the headlines
to know climate
change is happening.
They've been reading
the signs for years.
Sea ice gone “rotten” in winter—
too thin to walk on.
Seals, belugas, and salmon
migrating earlier and earlier.
Shorelines getting
swallowed up by the ocean.
All of this within a generation.
Indigenous knowledge like this
is crucial for understanding
the threats of the present.
But can it also point
the way forward?
Hi, I’m Che Jim
and welcome to
Crash Course Native American History.
[THEME MUSIC]
Today’s world is under
massive threat from climate change.
Heat waves, hurricanes,
cold snaps, wildfires —
they’ve all intensified.
Endangering not only
the environment, but also us.
I’m feeling very
chill about this.
It’s a complex problem that’s going to
require a lot of coordinated solutions.
Just ask Crash Course
Climate & Energy.
But one hugely important place
to look for solutions is…
Indigenous communities.
See, no matter where we’ve lived,
Indigenous people have become
experts on our environments.
Some of us learned how
to grow crops in the desert.
Others figured out which animals
went on the move and when.
Still others were able to find
food in every layer of the forest.
All of this is what we call
traditional ecological knowledge,
or T-E-K for short.
It’s information about the world
around us that has been passed down
from generation to generation
since time immemorial.
You can think of T-E-K
as systems of knowledge
formed in relationship
with a specific place.
You might say we’re all TEK-ies.
Look, it’s the last episode,
I’m just going for it.
As I was saying,
this knowledge is particular
to different locations.
For example, how
do you build a boat?
Near the Great Lakes,
you strap sheets of birch bark
around cedar frames,
then waterproof the seams with
a goo of pine sap and animal fat.
But up north, Arctic peoples
built frames out of driftwood
or whalebone wrapped with sealskin—
which is light and elastic enough
to take a hit from an ice floe.
Same question, different answers,
depending on what’s around you.
But while Traditional Ecological Knowledge
is incredibly place-specific,
it’s also about the big picture.
It’s built on the understanding that
everything is connected
by a web of relationships.
Yes. Even you!
Even him.
So, Inuit Elders might talk
about belugas in the ocean
in the same breath as
beavers in the rivers.
They understand that more beavers
means more dams,
means less spawning habitat,
means fewer salmon,
means fewer belugas.
That’s what I mean by big picture;
it’s an ecological view,
all about relationships.
Now, in Episode 8,
we explored how Indigenous people
figured stuff like this out,
hundreds of years before
Western scientists did.
And there are so many ways this
knowledge remains useful today,
and for the future.
Let me tell you a story… 
[snaps fingers]
Native nations in California —
like the Hupa, Yurok,
Karuk, and Mono —
have known for generations
that you can fight fire with fire.
Historically, they burned small,
low-intensity controlled burns
as a way of curating the landscape.
You see, after these burns,
plants that were good for food
and medicine grew back stronger.
And burning kept space
between the older, taller trees,
so flames didn’t rage
through the whole forest.
But when colonizers laid eyes
on these lovingly curated landscapes,
they thought that was
just how the trees grew.
And that the fires were
pointless, backwards.
The state of California outlawed
intentional burning in 1850,
while forcing many tribes off their lands.
Meanwhile, the forests were
logged and replanted —
this time, twice as densely.
Fast-forward to today.
Thanks to climate change,
wildfires are a serious threat.
These denser, warmer, drier forests
are like a box of matchsticks.
And Western scientists
are starting to understand
what tribes have
been saying all along:
good fire can prevent bad fire.
Thankfully, the government
is coming around, too.
In 2022, the State of California affirmed
tribes’ rights to practice cultural burning.
Today, some tribes —
and their good fire —
are being welcomed back
on the land that hasn’t been touched
by cultural burning
in over 150 years.
And that is the
story of good fire.
So there’s some
good stuff happening!
But there’s much
more to be done.
And while climate change
affects everyone,
it doesn’t affect
everyone equally.
Native nations along coasts
and in the far north
are already being
disproportionately impacted,
as their homes are being
hit first and more severely
by climate change’s effects.
Alaska Native communities
are getting a front-row seat
to shorter winters,
earlier springs,
changes in migration,
and thinning ice.
Because of these changes,
it’s getting harder to hunt and fish.
Which is a huge loss.
A recently coined term
— solastalgia—
describes the grief of witnessing
the environment change
in ways you don’t want
and can’t control.
Anybody can feel this.
But as the climate changes,
Alaska Native communities
are especially at risk
of harms to their mental health.
These communities already experience
disproportionately high suicide rates.
And not being able to hunt and fish,
or practice their traditions
impacts their sense of community,
connection, and self-worth.
On top of that, tribal communities
living on coasts are at risk
of losing their homes altogether,
as sea-level rise
washes away low-laying land.
As of 2024, thirty-one Alaska Native
villages are in imminent danger of erosion,
and at least a dozen of those villages
have already chosen to relocate altogether.
In what’s now Washington State,
the Quinault Tribe and
the Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe
are working to relocate for the same reason.
And that’s just to name a few.
Many tribes are seeking environmental justice,
which involves recognizing
and supporting groups who suffer
disproportionately from environmental damage,
through no fault of their own.
Often as a result of ongoing
legacies of colonialism and racist policy.
And for more on that, check out
episode 1 and 2….
3…4… all the episodes.
But from an Indigenous perspective?
Environmental justice is more than that.
It means taking in,
and taking care of,
the whole picture.
In the words of
Dina Gilio-Whitaker —
a scholar and member
of the Colville Confederated Tribes,
“...justice for Indigenous peoples
is about restoring balance
in relationships that
are out of balance.“
I’ll give you an example.
For generations, the Ojibwe
have had a reciprocal relationship
with wild rice —
which they call manoomin.
In their oral tradition,
a long-ago prophecy
predicted their people
would move west,
to a place “where the
food grows on water.”
The prophecy also predicted
light-skinned newcomers
would either bring brotherhood, death,
or death-disguised-as-brotherhood.
Are those…the only options?
Anyway, the place in the prophecy
was the Great Lakes region.
The “food that grows on
water” was manoomin.
I’ll let you draw your own
conclusions about the rest.
Manoomin is a sacred plant,
but a sensitive one.
It grows best in cool, shallow waters,
after long freezing winters.
Under climate change,
those conditions are
getting harder to come by.
And manoomin has been in decline
in many lakes and rivers for decades,
for lots of reasons.
Dams, pollution, commercial
overharvesting, disease
—it’s all in the mix.
But in some places,
it’s hard to pinpoint
any single cause.
And the Ojibwe understand that
embracing this complexity is the answer.
You can’t talk about manoomin
without thinking in terms of the bigger whole.
In recent years, a partnership
to save manoomin has emerged
between the Lac du Flambeau Band
of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians
and researchers at the University of Minnesota.
Joe Graveen, a scientist with the tribe,
has encouraged non-Native researchers
to embrace an ecological view
of what’s going on with the rice.
To study entire watersheds,
not just specific lakes.
To look at historical documents,
not just last year’s data.
And to build relationships with tribal
members who know this land
and have observed tiny changes
over time that newcomers might not notice.
Tribal members and researchers
haven’t yet figured out
why manoomin is declining
at Lac du Flambeau.
But partnerships like this
might just point to the path forward.
And the Ojibwe are far from the only tribe
using Traditional Ecological Knowledge
to respond to a climate-changed world.
The Confederated Tribes
of the Umatilla Indian Reservation
have created a plan that emphasizes
sharing TEK with other Native nations,
and securing funding to make
housing more energy-efficient.
The Yakama Nation's
Climate Adaptation Plan
includes buying back farm land
to support food security for tribal members,
and restoring some of it to native habitat.
And the Indigenous Seed Keepers Network
is working to restore relationships
between Native nations
and their ancestral crops.
Bringing back seeds that haven’t been grown
in their communities of origin for many years.
And using them to help
feed future generations.
So, where does this leave us
as we reach the end of our journey together?
I guess, somewhere not so different
from the prophecy the Ojibwe ancestors foretold.
Light-skinned newcomers;
brotherhood, death, or
death-disguised-as-brotherhood.
Check, check, check, and…check.
[Che gulps]
But those were just the first
four predictions the prophecy made.
It was also predicted that there would be
struggles, grief, and promises broken.
These guys were good.
And there was another prophecy—
one that foretold the forests
and prairies would disappear,
and the water would be polluted.
And again, the Ojibwe would face
a choice between two paths:
brotherhood or destruction.
The people would only
find the right path, the good one,
if they retraced their steps,
farther back on the trail.
Which is what we’ve
been doing this whole time.
Throughout this series,
we’ve explored just a fraction
of the hundreds of timelines
that make up Native American history.
But we’ve retraced as many
steps as we could,
to try to uncover a bigger picture.
Not just of the past.
But of the present.
And the future, too.
You’ve caught me talking about
five hundred years ago
and last year in the same breath.
And I hope now you understand why.
The past and present are connected,
much more closely than you think.
And there’s knowledge all around us,
just waiting to lead us
further up the trail.

t6xLo1XYZZs,"It's 1764,
Northwest England, 8:00 in the morning.
Yes, this is still crash course, Futures
of AI. Just stay with me. You put on
your linen shift and petticoat [music]
and start your day at the neighborhood
cottage core textile industry using your
trusty spinning wheel to turn wool into
thread. But today, your spinning wheel
has been replaced by a new giant machine
that can spin eight threads in the time
it takes you to make one. It's called
the spinning jenny, and in one fell
swoop, it's revolutionized [music] the
textile industry and stolen your job.
Wait, rapid technological advances
replacing jobs? Where have I heard that
before? Hi, I'm Kushian Avdar and this
is Crash Course, Futures of AI.
To help us understand exactly how it
could transform our world, some
researchers like to break down AI into
levels. The first level is narrowly
transformative AI. This is the kind of
technology that could lead to
practically irreversible change, but
only in a specific area like the
spinning jenny did for textiles. But
some AI models have the potential to
change all the most important aspects of
our society. We call that second level
transformative AI and it's on par with
inventions like electricity and the
internal combustion engine which you
know transformed our entire world. And
then there's another third level, a
theoretical level that we're building up
to that could make even bigger changes,
ones we can't exactly imagine yet.
radically transformative AI could impact
not just our day-to-day lives, but how
we measure progress, find worth, and
think about our place in the world. Most
people think AI with human level
intelligence, known as artificial
general intelligence, or AGI, would be
radically transformative. It's hard to
predict when AGI will hit the streets or
the cloud. Some people think we're
really close, like a year or two away,
but some others put that number closer
to the year 2030 or even 2050. A small
subset of people think we're centuries
away from AGI, if we achieve it ever.
But even without AGI, we're already in
for some pretty big world restructuring.
One really clear way we're seeing AI
restructure our world already is in the
economy. [music] And to help us
understand exactly how, the industrial
revolution is probably [music] the most
helpful example. See, the industrial
revolution saw a lot of manual labor
become automated, done by fast, accurate
machines like the spinning jenny,
instead of slow, fallible humans like
me. And automation turned out to be
really good for the economy, mainly
because it increased production, [music]
or the amount of stuff that could be
made. That's because normally economies
are limited by the amount of labor or
workers they have available. But the
spinning jenny and other industrial
revolution era technologies helped
industries scoot around that bottleneck
and the era's economy absolutely
exploded. These days, thanks to [music]
AI, machines don't just spin thread.
They can design the clothes it gets made
into, manage inventory at the store that
sells them, run the algorithm that
recommends them to you, and handle
returns and exchanges when you call
customer service. And it doesn't end
with the textile industry. This is
happening across tons of different
markets. And just [music] like all those
centuries ago, that automation could be
really good for our economy. Consider
this. Our gross world product, the final
market value of all the stuff created in
the world's economy in a given year,
usually grows by around two to 5% a
year. But if AI keeps advancing the way
it has been, some people predict that
[music] by 2100, our gross world product
could be growing not by 5% [music]
but by as much as 30% every year. It's
kind of unimaginable. And even though
many economists [music] are skeptical of
this number, it's safe to say that this
could potentially mean really big things
for the economy. But just like back
then, there's a dirty soot blackened
flip [music] side to the automation
coin. What's good for the economy
overall isn't always good for individual
workers. The more jobs that get taken
over by automation, the more human
employees are pushed out of work.
[music] And that could change a lot more
than how long it takes us to spin eight
threads. Narrowly transformative AI is
already changing the workforce. Since
the 2000s, automation has taken over
something like 1.7 million jobs from
customer service to data entry to
manufacturing to writing and editing.
But not here on Crash Course. Don't
worry, humans. And if AGI were to enter
the chat, even more jobs or even entire
professions would be cooked. AGI isn't
here yet, but theoretically it would be
able to do anything human cognition can.
And it might even be able to do that
work better than we can, transforming
not only the economy, but all of human
society in a way we're not ready for
yet. But let's see it wear a top hat as
well as I can. Like AGI could take over
the entire workforce, restricting humans
to narrow positions like AI oversight,
which could be few and far between. And
that's not even mentioning the
environmental impacts of AGI. Even
today's AI uses huge quantities of
energy and water and pumps out huge
quantities of greenhouse gases. Recent
data suggests that the average AI data
center consumes anywhere [music] from
500,000 to several million gallons of
water every day. And if AGI becomes
ubiquitous, that number will probably
skyrocket. All of which is going to
exacerbate the pretty gnarly climate
change we're already seeing, impacting
not just [music] the natural world, but
our human communities, too. If the
radical transformation happens slowly
enough, and [music] governments start
planning for it, like now, we might have
time to make it work, governments could
introduce environmental standards that
require energy usage to be transparent
and [music] push companies towards
greener data centers. They're not
currently where I sit in the US in 2025,
but theoretically they could be.
Governments could adopt structures like
job guarantees that would keep us from
being swapped out by AI. Or they could
take things even further and adopt
universal basic income to make sure
people still have money even if our
labor is replaced by machines. Or
implement dividend schemes where humans
would get small payouts from the profits
AI makes. And that could be really
transformative if AI takes humanity's
place as the beast of burden for our
economy. There's kind of no telling what
we'd get up to. It could totally realign
our values, our social structures, and
and the ways we spend our time. It could
change us from cogs in the capitalist
machine into maybe something else. I
might finally have time to catch them
all.
I'm at one. But if the transition
happens too fast, without the proper
safety nets, AGI could leave the
majority of humanity unemployed, broke,
and well, chat, cooked. Even if robots
don't take over the whole workforce,
these advances in AI could spell
disaster for lots of regular people. One
way this could happen is that the first
people to develop AGI could get really
powerful really fast. That could mean a
single company starts to amass tons and
tons of wealth, making the wealth
inequality of 2025 look like chump
change. And think about it on a
governmental level. What if a single
government could gain huge political,
economic, and military advantages over
all the other ones? The prospect of that
huge advantage could lead to an AI arms
race where countries, corporations, and
maybe even extremist organizations
hustle to build that super powerful AGI
model first. All that stuff could be
pretty bad news for most of humanity. It
could concentrate wealth and influence
in the hands of big companies like
Microsoft or Google, billionaires like
Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg, or greedy
governments who don't always have the
people's best interest in mind. It could
be used to support authoritarianism
around the globe. And I'm gonna level
with you. That process is already
starting. Deep fakes are images, videos,
or audio recordings that can make it
look like people are saying or doing
things they didn't really say or do.
They work like lots of other AI does,
where neural networks train on tons and
tons of data until they can start to
generate new data that looks a lot like
it. Only instead of chess games or
novels, these neural networks train on
faces, voices, and body language to
learn how people look, sound, and move.
And they can get pretty good at
imitating people, like say US
presidential candidates. In July of
2024, Musk himself shared a campaign
video from Democratic candidate Kala
Harris where she called herself a deep
state puppet who's hiding her total
incompetence. only Harris never said
that. The video was a deep fake made by
AI models trained on Harris's face and
voice. And it was viewed over 100
million times. Deep fakes are an example
of how AI can be used to influence
voters, spread disinformation, and throw
elections to those willing to play
dirty. And it's not just political
parties who are using AI to influence
politics, but foreign nations, too. Lots
of the deep fake content from the 2024
US election seems to have come from
Russia, a country that might have some
reasons to mess with the US's democracy.
Deep fakes's actual impacts on voters
aren't totally clear yet, but there
[music] is evidence that they've already
influenced voter behavior, not only in
the US, but also in countries like
Slovakia, Indonesia, and India. And
things could only get worse as deep
fakes get more advanced, manipulating
voters with disinformation, generating
doubts around legitimate election
results or convincing people not to vote
at all. Messing with elections like that
is a direct threat to democracy. And if
AI can help people do it, then it could
easily become a tool of
authoritarianism, a pretty powerful one.
And the more AI gets implemented in
things like politics and economics, the
more power it'll have in those systems,
and the more it will be able to enforce
the values of those potentially pretty
evil groups who leverage it. This
hypothetical situation is known as value
lockin and it could leave us stuck with
systems that are inequitable,
anti-democratic, and a threat to human
rights all supported by AI. So that all
sounds scary, but it also kind of sounds
like science fiction. While things like
deep fakes are real and dangerous,
radically transformative AI isn't
actually here yet, and we can't be sure
exactly how things will play out as we
move into our AI future. Things could go
down the radical road where AGI takes
over our jobs and political systems,
robbing us of what it means to be human
or even going rogue and throwing off its
human overlords entirely. And true, AI
development has been increasing
exponentially, blowing benchmarks and
expert predictions out of the water
faster than you can say, ""Alexa, how do
you spell anti-isestablishmentarianism?""
All of which makes that robot takeover
kind of scenario seem more and more
likely by the day. But there are any
number of other things that could happen
too, making our AI future nothing more
than a twinkle in Wall-E's melancholic
robot eye. For instance, governments
could intervene, taking action now to
put a leash on things before they get
too out of hand. Or we could start to
run out of the new relevant highquality
data that AI models need for training
stalling progress. Or maybe AI
development itself could end up slowing
way down. And of course, there's always
the possibility that AI just can't do as
good a job as we think it can. So, the
AI takeover could be fast and shocking,
or it could never happen at all, or it
could turn out the dolphins were behind
everything all along. Anything is
possible. But that doesn't mean we
should get complacent. A long time ago,
the spinning jenny probably sounded like
science fiction, too. And if we look the
other way for too long, we could end up
trudging sadly home in our petty coats,
choking on factory fumes, wondering if
this is the end of life as we know it.
But to really prepare for the
possibilities of our AI future, we have
to answer two really important
questions. How powerful can AI become?
And how quickly can it get there? That's

7Tg2mCKP6tY,"Cowboys and Indians. It's a beloved
trope of westerns which go all the way
back to the dawn of American cinema. In
the 1890s, Thomas Edison used his new
fangled kettocope to film Buffalo Bill's
Wild West Show, a sort of traveling
rodeo that reenacted battles between
American [music] settlers and Native
Americans. These depictions were far
from accurate, but in a lot of ways,
they're still with us. Why are these
stereotypes so hard to shake? Hi, I'm
Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.
In its day, Buffalo Bill spun tales
about savage warriors who were out for
blood and noble tribal leaders who
belong to a cartoonish mythical past.
And these racist stereotypes made their
way into the American Western movie,
which was a problem for a lot of
reasons, not least because for many
Americans, the first and sometimes only
time they saw indigenous people was on
screen. And these flattened phony
caricatures discouraged them from seeing
native people, well, as people.
Didn't I smash you already?
For decades, Native American movie roles
tended to fall into a few main tropes.
Drunken Indians, aggressive [music]
warriors, magical healers, sage elders,
and Indian princesses. Quick fact check,
Indian princesses aren't even a thing,
despite how many of them reach out to me
on Instagram. Take the Oscar nominated
film [music] Stage Coach. It's a John
Wayne western from the 1930s, and one of
its main plot points is the constant
threat of attack from the bloodthirsty
Apache. Also, I just have to say that
the Spanish [music] came up with the
name Apache. The tribe called themselves
Inday or person or people. Anyway,
[music] there were a lot of these films,
like a ton. Hollywood has made more than
4,000 movies about native people. And
while native folks did get cast in a lot
of these movies, they were typically
relegated to uncredited background roles
and [music] paid a lot less.
Meanwhile, the higherp paying native
roles went to white people in Redface.
That term is used to describe non-native
people impersonating Native Americans,
whether they use makeup to alter their
complexion or not. But it also refers to
this long-standing casting bias in
Hollywood. And that bias went all the
way down to costumes and props. Without
native folks on set to advise on
cultural practices, you wind up with
everyone in feathered headdresses and
buckskin, which is traditional clothing
for the Plains Indians, but isn't for
hundreds of other tribes. So it
effectively flattened the massive
diversity of native cultures into one
smooshed together tribe. Not to mention
that for many tribes including plays
Indians feathers and war bonnets have
deep spiritual significance that aren't
meant for everyday wear or um Coachella.
So yeah, the history of Native Americans
in film was characterized by this
terrible catch 22 where either Native
actors got cast in demeaning roles that
stereotype their identity or non-native
actors got their jobs. Which brings us
to a man who at the height of his fame
was dubbed America's favorite Indian
ironized Cody. His OG name was Aspera
Oscar Decorti and he was born in 1904 in
Louisiana. [music]
He wasn't native at all. His parents
were both Italian immigrants and 20th
[music] century America wasn't a
friendly place for them. Folks from
places like Ireland and Italy faced a
lot of racial prejudice because they
weren't considered white at the time.
Which isn't to say that's why Oscar
decided to pose as Native American. But
its context is worth mentioning. In the
1920s, Oscar and his two brothers moved
to Hollywood to pursue film [music]
careers. And they anglicized their last
name to Cody, a common practice at the
time. [music] At some point, Oscar
started claiming that his father was
Cherokee and his mother was Cree [music]
and that he grew up on a reservation in
Oklahoma. Over the years, he slowly rose
to fame, appearing in over 100 westerns
and popular [music] TV shows.
Intentionally or not, he became
Hollywood's and America's symbol of
Native identity. But Ironized Cody was
actually [music] a pretend, someone who
falsely claims Native American identity.
And there's a long history of
pretendians in the US, [music]
not just in Hollywood, but also in
academia and politics. Take
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren.
For years, she publicly referenced her
Cherokee heritage. After much criticism,
she released the results of a DNA test
that proved she did have a Native
American ancestor about 10 generations
ago. But as the Cherokee Nation pointed
out in a statement, a drop of blood is
not what makes someone Native. Using a
DNA test to lay claim to any connection
to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal
nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate
and wrong, said Cherokee Nation
Secretary of State Chuck Hoskin Jr. at
the time. By the way, there's much more
on tribal identity in episode 4. In any
case, pretendants can cause real harm.
They often take up resources that could
otherwise be accessed by actual Native
Americans while profiting off of
historical and ongoing trauma while also
misrepresenting us. For example,
non-indigenous folks can get
preferential treatment for scholarships
and jobs by simply checking a box on an
application, even sometimes going as far
as to become wellrespected indigenous
scholars who position themselves as
authorities on native issues when in
reality they have no claim to indigenous
heritage or culture. But the whole
concept of pretendians is also
complicated. There's a danger to
policing native identity which might
discourage people who are generally
trying to reconnect to their indigenous
heritage after years of being violently
disconnected from it. And it's up to
each individual tribe to decide who
belongs to them. And no broader
governing body can do that job. No
social media mob either. Because this
type of belonging isn't just a roll
call, it's a relationship. Like Kovville
journalist Dena Helio Whitaker said in
an interview, it's not just about your
right to claim or to reconnect to that
tribal identity. It's about what your
responsibilities are to it. Ultimately,
pretendianism is a form of cultural
appropriation. When members of a
dominant culture adopt symbols, arts,
and ideas from historically
disenfranchised cultures in a way that
exploits, disrespects, or stereotypes
them. And it happens everywhere all the
time. Think those war bonnets at
Coachella, the sports mascots, and the
regrettable Halloween costumes. Compared
to an allout identity theft, cultural
appropriation can feel kind of subtle.
Dressing up as Native American might not
seem like a big deal since no one
actually thinks a white person in a
headdress is really claiming this
heritage. But it's still harmful for a
lot of reasons. For one, it separates
the object from its specific cultural
meaning. Like we talked about earlier,
for many tribes, war bonnets are a
symbol of honor. So wearing one to a
music festival disrespects that cultural
tradition. Also, just like the Hollywood
westerns that collapse hundreds of
distinct cultures into one stereotype,
dressing up as Native American makes a
caricature out of real living people. In
fact, believing that Native Americans
are a relic of the past can make
non-natives think that those costumes
aren't offensive. Hi again. Yep, still
here. And not only are we still here,
but the legacies of colonialism are
still ongoing in our communities. As
Cherokee writer and scholar Adrien Keane
points out, dawning a headdress means
contributing to the culture of power
that continues to cycle today. Cultural
appropriation can also apply to native
inspired items such as dream catchers
and jewelry. I get it. Our designs are
dope. But when non-native folks profit
off of those designs, it's not a good
look. In fact, in some cases, it's
illegal. Since 1990, the Indian Arts and
Crafts Act had made it illegal to market
native products as such unless they're
actually made by a Native American
artist, which is great for both the
creators and the consumers because the
inauthentic dream catcher isn't going to
do you any good. Trust me, those
nightmares know a real one when they see
one. Pretendianism and cultural
appropriation can be messy and native
folks don't always agree on where
exactly the lines fall, which makes
sense because contrary to the old
cowboys and Indian stereotype, we're not
all the same. But thankfully today,
there are more natives than ever in all
kinds of creative roles. And in
Hollywood, we're not just increasingly
represented on screen, we're also in the
director's chair. Just look at the FX
hit show [music] Reservation Dogs. All
of the writers, directors, and actors
playing native characters are native
folks. The show paints a funny, quirky,
and authentic [music] portrait of what
life on a reservation is like. And then
you've got examples of creative
collaboration like Martin Scorsese's
[music] Oscar nominated movie Killers of
the Flower Moon, starring Lily Gladstone
of Crash Course film [music] production
fame. She has six tequipoo
heritage and grew up on the Blackfoot
reservation in Montana. Um, actually,
hey ch, it's pronounced
and nimi poo.
>> Hundreds of natives were consulted for
the movie, and according to Lily, it
made a big difference. Our voices exist
in community, she said in an interview.
It's a lot to put on one person to be
the voice for such a large body of a
very diverse group of people. By the
way, Lily also helped me out with our
episode on indigenous women. So, there's
been a lot of positive change since the
heyday of the Hollywood western, and
there's still a long way to go. But when
native people get to tell our own rich
and diverse stories, when we [music] get
to collaborate with each other and share
our worldviews, our people, and our
sense of humor, that's when the real
movie magic happens.
Next time we'll talk about traditional
indigenous knowledge and how ecological
practices from the past might just be
the way forward. And I will see you
then. Thanks for watching this episode

Nh4I1hMvubU,"Stories have power and they can be
wielded for good or for evil. One guy
who knew just how true that was, Raphael
Trujillo, one of the crulest dictators
in Latin American history. He bought
into the idea that history was an
official and singular story. So in order
to control the Dominican people, he
tried to take away the stories they told
about themselves. Hi, I'm Kurly
Velasquez and this is Crash Course Latin
American Literature.
>> [music]
>> The countries of Latin America are no
strangers to authoritarianism. The kind
of government that requires
unquestioning loyalty and offers little
individual freedom in return. Strong
men, tyrants, and dictators have marked
the region's history and literature for
hundreds of years. So much so that a
whole genre distinct to Latin American
literature emerged around it. La nolla
del dictador the dictator novel. These
books offer something different from an
officially sanctioned singular story.
They give us multiple perspectives,
critiques, and glimpses behind the
scenes into people's everyday lives.
Let's start in the 19th century. A lot
of Latin America's trouble with tyrants
stemmed from something unexpected.
Geography. Seriously, this is such a big
deal that there's a whole genre called
nollas de laier, novels of the earth.
And no, this isn't your Rosa de
Guadalupe kind of nolla. These novels
explore the relationship between Latin
America's physical landscape and its
political and cultural landscapes. See,
in the 19th century, large swats of
Latin America were undeveloped Selva,
Yanos, and Compass, jungle, plains, and
grassland. And even once fledgling
countries like Argentina were free
[music] from colonial rule, they didn't
have the infrastructure to govern or
maintain any sort of orderly democratic
control. Enter the Galdos on horseback.
These guys were like the most intense
gauchos ever. They were more like
cowboys and they rode their horses
across the bumps, seizing political
power through charisma and sheer brute
force. They were unfortunately just
another type of authoritarian leader.
[music] And just like they dominated the
Argentinian pampas, Galios also
dominated the literature of the period.
Domingo Finoto's 1845 novel Fakundo
Civic Evvar civilization and barbarism
is a prime example. It's a fictionalized
biography of the titular Fakundo who's
pretty much the platonic ideal of the
corrupt Galdo, but he's not 100%
fictional. He's based on the lieutenant
of real life Argentinian dictator Juan
Manuel de Rosas. And just like his
right-hand man, Rosas came from a
wealthy landowning family and used his
power to become a swaggering Galdo. Then
he kept forcing his way to the top,
eventually becoming dictator of
Argentina for 17 years, using tactics
like spies and secret police to silence
political opposition and exiling guys
like Sardento who dared to question his
authority. Now the Argentinian pampas
are huge about the size of Beyonce's
Texas and Sardento describes them
lyrically. immense the plains, immense
the forests, immense the rivers, the
always uncertain horizon. Apparently,
everything is bigger in Argentina, too.
But Sagmentoto also thinks the region is
barbaric because the Pampas are so
isolated from so-called civilization.
Sadento hoped to convince readers that
as long as Argentina existed as an
untamed region, the land would continue
to produce dangerous strong men like
Rosas and Fakundo. He writes from these
characteristics arises in the life of
the Argentine people, the reign of brute
force, the supremacy of the strongest,
the absolute and irresponsible authority
of rulers. In other words, the Caldo
strongman is a direct result of the
undeveloped landscape. Quite the theory.
Santo called for economic development
and improving the country's education
system to finally rid the region of
tyrants. And he led some of that himself
when he was elected president of
Argentina in 1868,
16 years after Rossas was overthrown.
But he also propped up a false binary of
barbarism and civilization. Although the
Pampas were isolated and not heavily
populated, they weren't empty of people
or communities. They were home to
indigenous groups like the Mapuche and
Pampas Indians of Argentina and the
Guani Indians of Paraguay.
people who Serento aimed to erase both
in his literature and as a president who
waged a decadesl long war against
indigenous peoples. So although Smento
was democratically elected and made
meaningful strides for the country, he's
still a controversial figure. Now let's
travel forward in time to the 20th
century, which was, you guessed it, also
chalk full of dictators, strong men, and
bloody revolutions. Wow, this episode
really has no chill. In 1910, Mexico
rose up against the 30-year tenure of
dictator Porfidio Diaz, resulting in a
decadel long revolution that killed over
1 million people. In 1959, Fulhensio
Batista, the Cuban military officer
turned dictator was overthrown in the
Cuban revolution [music] and Chile's
1973 Gulp Pedestat
resulted in the death of [music]
President Salvadorende
and helped establish the military
dictator Agusto Pinoce in his place. All
of this was topped off with guerrilla
warfare, police violence, kidnappings,
and disappearances at the hands of the
government and a whole general vibe of
persecution that was decidedly not it.
And from all this bloody violence
emerged [music] more novellas delicador
written sometime between 1950 and 1975.
Many of these novels were part of the
boom. The literary movement we talked
about in an earlier episode that saw
Latin American novels in translation
popping off around the world. In fact,
many folks consider the boom period to
start off with one novella delicado in
particular. El seor presidente Mr.
President by the Guatemalan writer
Miguelanel Atorias. Here are the curly
notes. Published in 1946, El Seor
Presidente tells the story of a
fictionalized dictator who rules over an
unnamed country with an iron fist. Known
only as the president, he rarely appears
in the text and yet he hangs over every
character in action like a cloud of
tyrant scented freze. The main character
is actually the president's favorite
adviser, Miguel Angelface, who carries
out his boss's dirty work in exchange
for safety and power. But when Angelface
falls in love with the daughter of an
alleged traitor, he starts to question
his loyalties. You know how the story
goes. Boy meets girl, boy falls in love,
boy gets in trouble with the terrifying
dictator. Anyway, the novel also
includes elaborate dream sequences,
blending realistic elements with magical
ones in a technique called magical
realism. And this makes it hard for both
the characters and the reader to sort
out fact from fiction, which mirrors
some of the psychological effects of
living under a dictatorship. I won't
spoil the end of a singor presidente for
you, [music] but suffice it to say that
Atorias has a message to get across
about loyalty and power in the face of
tyrants. And while some argue that the
president might be modeled on Guatemalan
leader Manuel Estrada Cabrera, allegedly
allegedly, other scholars say the
decision to write about an unnamed
dictator in an unnamed country tells us
something else. That the novel is less
interested in recounting the story of
one historical figure and more
interested in exploring the effects that
a dictatorship has on a society. Those
lessons can be applied across Latin
America and the rest of the world. Now,
let's move forward into the 1990s. Here,
we start to see many dictator novels
being written after the dictatorships
ended, giving modern readers new
perspective on tyrants of the past. Like
Julia Alvarez's English language novel,
In the Time of the Butterflies, takes
place in the Dominican Republic during
the dictatorship of Raphael Trujillo,
the guy we talked about at the top of
this episode, but it was published 60
years later in 1994. I wonder what
they'll be writing about us 60 years
from now. In the time of the butterflies
tells the story of ordinary Dominicans,
the real [music] life Miraal sisters,
Patria, Minerva, and Maria Teresa. The
sisters were part of the underground
resistance against Ruhill's brutal
regime and they were killed on his
orders on November 25th, 1960.
Unwittingly, Thruhill turned the Miraal
sisters into martyrs for the
revolutionary cause. They became known
as Lasibosas, the butterflies. Just 6
months later, he was assassinated.
Alvarez had a personal interest in the
story of the Miraal sisters. Four months
before their murder, her own family had
escaped to the US when her father was
targeted by the Dominican Republic's
secret police. But when she turned to
the sister's story years later, she felt
that their role as martyrs had flattened
who they were as people. So, she decided
to write about their personal lives
through historical fiction. In the
novel, each sister, including the sole
survivor, Dee, narrates several chapters
from her own point of view. [music] We
follow them as they grow up, fall in
love, and dream about their futures. In
other words, as their everyday lives
continue, [music]
even in the face of a dictatorship,
through makes only four brief, menacing
appearances, and [music] each of the
sisters comes to realize he's not the
benevolent figure he claims to be. When
Meda finally gets to go to school, where
she learns the truth about Thruio, she
laments, ""I just left a smaller cage to
go into a bigger one, the size of our
whole country."" Yearning for freedom is
a pretty relatable sentiment for anyone
who's ever been a kid. And Minva's
discovery that freedom [music] is an
impossibility for everyone in her
country is a painful reversal. By
reading about real ordinary people like
the Miraal sisters, we get a richer
understanding of life under dictatorship
and fiction provides a window into
history that's different from textbooks
and official documents. Like Alvarez
writes in her post script, ""A novel is
not after all a historical document, but
a way to travel through the human heart.
The novela dictador is a distinctly
Latin American genre, and there are even
more dictator novels than the ones we
talked about today. The Underdogs by
Mariano Auela, Dona Barbara by Romelo
Gosopremo
by Austo Roavastos, and The Farming of
Bones by Eduge Tantika to name just a
few. And these novels prove that fiction
can give us a lot more perspective and
nuance than the tyrannical voice of a
dictator, which is a big deal because
unfortunately, dictatorships aren't a
phenomenon of the past. Today over 50
countries in the world are living under
authoritarian regimes. Tyrants like want
their victims to buy into a single
story. But when we step into the hearts
and minds of others through fiction, we
learn to see the world and ourselves
more complexely. Next time we'll talk
about the role of memory in the
aftermath of dictatorships. See you
then. Thanks for watching this episode

UFJQV5Jb0pY,"For half a century, computing power grew
exponentially. In [music] the 1960s,
most computers were the size of a
refrigerator, and they took a long time
to do pretty much anything. But by the
2010s, hundreds of millions of people
were walking around with personal
computers right in their pockets [music]
and near infinite information available
at the swipe of a fingertip. The change
was unbelievably fast. It was like
nothing history had ever seen. And yet,
it's possible that it won't even hold a
candle to what's happening now.
Artificial intelligence. Hi, I'm Kushian
Avdar and this is Crash Course Futures
of AI.
Back in the 60s, that exponential growth
in computing power seemed virtually
impossible to most people. But one guy
saw it coming, an engineer named Gordon
Moore. In 1965, he predicted that every
2 years, we'd find a way to get twice as
many transistors onto a computer chip as
the previous one, making future
computers capable of things Moore and
his colleagues couldn't even imagine.
And he turned out to be totally right.
And his prediction came to be known as
Moore's law. And it held true for just
about 50 years. Today, progress has
shifted from transistors and chips to
the new frontier of artificial
intelligence. Artificial intelligence or
AI is really just a type of computer
system, only it's a really advanced
computer system that tries to emulate
intelligent behavior. AI is kind of an
umbrella term that includes some pretty
far out there stuff that doesn't even
exist yet, but also much more basic
programs like the facial recognition
software that unlocks your smartphone as
long as you don't grow out your beard or
shave your head or ditch your glasses
thanks to the wonders of LASIK.
Ask me how I know. AI is sometimes
defined by its ability to do stuff kind
of like what humans can do, like
learning from errors or making
predictions based on prior knowledge or
drawing hands. But it can also do stuff
humans can't, like remembering every
single thing it's ever heard, processing
millions of points of data in seconds,
and making hyperrealistic fake videos of
Tom Cruz covering Dave Matthews Band.
But this capability is a pretty new
thing, and it's taken decades to get to
this point. Back in the 1950s, computers
couldn't even help you with your
homework or play a game of chess. At
least not until 1957.
That is the year IBM created the
Bernstein chess program. The Bernstein
chess program was an example of narrow
AI. It's a kind of artificial
intelligence that only does one thing.
In this case, play a very good game of
chess. Basically, it used algorithms
that mimicked human strategies,
evaluating the board, picking out
plausible moves, and simulating them to
figure out which one would work the
best. Eventually, it got good enough to
beat an inexperienced human opponent.
But, it would have to be a pretty
patient human opponent. The thing took
like 8 minutes to make a single move.
Although, when I used to play chess with
my dad, sometimes we'd take like 20
minutes to make a single move. And that
makes the Bernstein chess program seem
like a certifiable speed racer. We were
thinking like really hard. In the
decades to come though, computers got
faster and the chess bots got better and
better, but they were still no match for
good human players. In the 70s, a
Russian program named Kaisa became the
world champion of computer chess
engines, but it still lost to human
chess master David Levy. In the 80s,
Grandmaster Gary Kasparov, the highest
ranked chess player in the world, played
against 32 bots at once and beat them
all. Then came the '9s and Deep Blue.
Building on their success with their
earlier chess bot, IBM created Deep
Blue. It could evaluate 200 million
chess positions per second. And at that
rate, Deep Blue could burn through all
those different simulations to pick the
best possible one. And in 1997, Deep
Blue beat Kasparov in a six-game match.
It was the first time a machine had
beaten a human chess world champion. But
Deep Blue, like all those other early
chess bots, was still an example of
symbolic AI. It's a kind of AI that
relies on the logic coded directly into
its hardware and makes moves by
hard-coded search and evaluation.
Meaning, it was never actually learning
or improving. It was just following the
same human instructions it was
programmed with. And while that can be
good, it wasn't great. But what if there
was a system [music] that operated a
little less like an instruction manual
and a little more like a human brain?
[music] In 2020, a chessbot called
Stockfish got something new, an
efficiently updatable neural network or
NNU, and it totally changed the game.
Well, the game was still chess, but you
know what I mean. Neural networks are a
special kind of computer [music]
architecture that works kind of like the
human brain, processing information with
layers of connected [music] nodes that
pass information between them along
weighted connection pathways. Unlike
symbolic [music] AI, bots that run on
any type of neural networks can change
based on experience. [music]
Like if during practice a chess move
leads to a checkmate in three, that
pathway will stay and the AI will
probably repeat that pattern in the
future. But if it costs the network its
queen, that AI is probably going to
revise its strategy. That process is
[music] called deep learning, and it
depends on three things. One, the amount
of data or information available for AIs
to learn from. two, an algorithm to
instruct its learning process. And
[music] three, what your friend who's
like really into AI calls compute, which
includes [music] processing power,
memory, and storage. And because
Stockfish is an efficiently updatable
neural network, it's got even more space
for that deep learning than a regular
neural network. While other AIs would
have to re-evaluate the whole chess
board every single move, Stockfish can
update incrementally, keeping up with
every move it plays. And that frees up a
lot of processing [music] space, and it
lets Stockfish think even harder about
its next move, which turns out to be
really helpful. Since 2020, it's won
basically every computer chess
championship there is. Although, it
hasn't played me yet. And not to brag,
but I have an account on uh chess.com.
Since the deep learning revolution of
the 2010s, neural networks have been the
foundation for basically all our AI up
until right now as I'm filming this
episode. And that includes the rise of
generalpurpose AI. Unlike narrow AI,
these systems can take on lots of
different tasks to achieve lots of
different goals, like writing books,
generating images, summarizing articles,
recognizing faces, driving cars, and
making Will Smith eat spaghetti. General
purpose AI isn't only able to engage in
deep learning. It's able to do so
really, really fast. That's thanks to a
tool called a transformer, which lets
certain kinds of AI process entire
sequences of data at once rather than
reading word by word or number by
number. That means generalpurpose AI is
getting really good at this stuff really
quickly. So quickly that some people are
starting to wonder how can we keep up.
Enter AI benchmarks and scaling laws. In
AI, benchmarks are standardized tests
that let us measure how well different
AI models perform. For narrow AI
systems, benchmarks can be pretty
straightforward. Like chess engines have
a lot of the same benchmarks as human
chess players, getting certain feed
ratings or beating other players or
engines. But for more generalized AI,
benchmarks have to evaluate performance
across lots of different domains. Like
large language models, which are neural
networks that use transformers to
process language, are supposed to be
able to do lots of different things. So,
they might be tested on whether they can
answer academic questions and accurately
summarize things they've read and write
a 10-minute romantic comedy in the style
of When Harry Met Sally.
AI agents like self-driving cars might
have to prove they can drive safely in
the rain and not hit a pedestrian on the
street. When AI models can consistently
perform well on a benchmark, it's
considered saturated. But these days,
benchmark saturation is happening kind
of freaky fast. In a world where AI can
identify faces, compose music, drive
cars, and take PhD level exams, the
question is less what can AI do and more
what can't it do? And it's something we
want to figure out before we're staring
down the barrel of the AI apocalypse.
The question is how? Thankfully, the
things we already know about AI, like
past benchmarks, can help with that. If
you look at how different AI systems
perform on different benchmarks, you can
see certain patterns and one leaps out
right away. In general, AI neural
networks that are fed more data perform
better. The more books a large language
model reads, the better it'll be at
writing its own. The more videos of Tom
Cruz a video generator watches, the more
lifelike its fake Tom Cruz will look.
He's beautiful. Particularly if that's
paired with more compute and other
scaling increases. If we squint, we can
actually put some numbers on those
patterns and come up with formulas that
describe exactly how an AI's performance
seems to change with different amounts
of data, compute, or both. We call those
formulas scaling laws. And so far, they
help us predict what future AI with even
more data, even more compute might be
able to do. Full disclosure, the
formulas themselves kind of look like
nonsense for everyone, but the most
saturated AI nerd, but they all mean the
same thing. Bigger is better. In the
world of neural networks and deep
learning, being able to find patterns
and learn from huge quantities of data
is going to work better than waiting for
a human expert to code them in. And the
more compute these machines have, the
faster and the more powerful they'll be.
Now, of course, there are caveats.
China's DeepSk is able to compete with
models like chat GPT despite having a
fraction of the compute. Plus, throwing
all that compute at pre-training isn't
showing the returns it once was. But
still, scaling laws explain why some of
the highest performing generalized AI
models belong to huge companies like
Microsoft and Google since they've got
access to tons of data and tons of
processing power. And following that
pattern into the future, scaling laws
can help us predict how capable AI might
become, gaining the power to transform
our economy or hand us over to
authoritarian dictators or make all our
likenesses sing covers of the Dave
Matthews Band. Crash course into me.
Yeah, baby.
I'm old. Woo! Are you feeling those
singles of excitement yet? Imagine how
AI feels. Just kidding. It It can't feel
probably. Just like Moore's law foretold
unimaginably small and fast computers,
[music]
scaling laws see a big future for AI. As
algorithms improve and data and compute
keep increasing, AI could deep learn its
way to some pretty advanced stuff like
finding new treatments for cancer or
achieving super intelligence. [music]
Moore's law held up for a good 50 years,
bringing us into this new era of
computing before slowing down. And
there's no guarantee that scaling laws
will last even that long, thanks to
potential bottlenecks down the road. But
any day now, AI could turn some new
corner [music] and scaling laws might
not be enough to tell if it's still
harmlessly marching pawns around or
coming for us all. Next time, we'll look
closer at what AI could really do in our
society other than lock us out of our
phones if and when emo bangs come back
in style. Crash Course Futures of AI was

0Y3ekwHfq5g,"Okay, preview for Crash Course, Futures
of AI. How should it start?
>> Welcome to Crash Course, Futures of AI,
where we explore the worldchanging
innovations of artificial intelligence.
>> Okay, that's fine. But let's see if we
can make it funnier.
>> Where we explore the world changing
innovations that artificial intelligence
is dragging to our doorstep like an
enthusiastic robot puppy who doesn't
know whether it brought you a pizza or
hacked your bank account.
>> Okay. Okay. Now try it like a hardboiled
private eye in a detective novel.
>> The name's tech. Private tech. I've seen
a lot in my time, but nothing prepared
me for this new wave of thinking
machines knocking on humanity's door,
asking questions we ain't ready to
answer. Okay, now try it as a cowboy in
an old western.
Uh, my producer is telling me I'm taking
up expensive filming time, and they're
probably right. So, let's get into it.
Hi, I'm Kusha Nvadar. I'm a former math
teacher, speech writer, Google tech bro,
and current host on public radio. And
now I'm so excited to be your not
artificial, very human guide to crash
course futures of AI. Now with AI,
there's a lot to talk about and we can't
cover all of it. In this 5 episode
miniseries, we'll focus on how AI could
advance, just how powerful it might get,
what that could mean for human society,
and how to prevent the malevolent robot
takeover. I'm ready. Even the best human
minds aren't totally sure how it's all
going to go down just yet. But we are
sure AI has the potential to make our
society more advanced and also to spread
fake news, decimate the job market,
exacerbate wealth inequality, and even
prop up authoritarian rulers across the
globe. And that puts scientists,
political leaders, and our whole society
in the pretty tricky position of having
to react to something that hasn't
actually happened yet. But one thing is
pretty certain. If we don't start
predicting and preparing for the future
of AI now, things could look a lot less
like Baymax from Big Hero 6 and a lot
more like Hal from Space Odyssey. So,
will AI be a force for good or will it
reinforce our human evils? Join us on
Crash Course Futures of AI to decide.

add them in the chat and I will ask
Megan and Annie on the side or Laser
will throw them up so they can ask
answer those questions in real time as
we go through or potentially we'll save
them for the end if that's a better time
for some of them. Um, and now all three
of us on this chat are on this call are
very used to making things for the
internet. Um, so of course that means we
love love YouTube comments. Um, so in
presentations like this it can feel kind
of weird because we can't see you. So we
would love you to be really active in
the chat. If you are excited about
something and if we could see you and we
could see you like leaning in, wanting
to know more about something, we would
probably like shift how we're presenting
the information. So if you're having a
lean-in moment and you want Megan or
Annie to slow down and talk more about
something, let us know in the chat. If
you're confused, like if we could be
able to see your furrowed brow and be
like, ""Is that making sense?"" Let's
explain it another way, go ahead and put
like a question mark or say, ""Could you
repeat in the in the chat?"" Um, both
Laser and I will be watching the chat
closely throughout this. Um, and now um
and then if you're just excited about
something, share that. We would love it.
Um, and so as I hand this over to Megan
and Annie now to introduce themselves,
please if you could introduce yourself
in the chat, hopefully you're doing that
already a bit. Um, share where you're
watching from. Share if you've watched
any other Learnathon content this month.
Um, and without further ado, let me
introduce you to Megan and Annie from
the Crash Course team.
>> Awesome. Thank you so much, Kaitlyn. Who
are these people? I uh, I'll start. My
name is Megan Mafairy. I've been at
Crash Course for about 3.5 years. And up
here on this slide are a few photos that
represent moments on my journey before I
came to Crash Course. So, um, going from
right to left, uh, because that's an
ordinary direction to go in. Uh, at in
the right you'll see a picture of me at
Georgetown. That's where I got my
master's degree. Uh, I studied English
with a focus on the environmental
humanities. Basically, what I focused on
was how we tell stories that help us
make sense of climate change and how
climate change sort of complicates the
way that we used to tell stories and the
way that we should tell stories about
the future. Uh, and when I was in grad
school, I was able to make a podcast
instead of a thesis. And then later, I
got to interview with Hank and talk
about my podcast as part of getting this
job. So that's a story I always love to
tell when I give when I talk to folks
who are like trying to move into a
different part of their career. I say
just like do your best to make the kind
of things that you want to be making.
And that was a really really big moment
for me um where it it panned out and I
was I was so pleased. Um, so before that
I was at National Geographic,
um, and I was working on educational
programs for teachers who were
interested in, um, including more
environmental and cultural literacy in
all different types of subjects they
taught. And uh the leftmost photo
represents a moment uh right at the very
beginning, very early in my career when
I was working as a public radio producer
uh for a little show in North Carolina.
It was a daily live talk show. And a big
part of my job was to research the topic
of conversation before uh before the
show happened live and to brief the host
about what what everything was going to
be about. Um, and in this particular
conversation, we were talking about a
new exhibit at our local science museum
that was focused on um, spittlebugs.
This bug that you see here in the
picture, uh, they like surround
themselves with this spit-like casing.
And I was just telling the host all
about the different scientific reasons
behind this. And uh there was this like
really this moment I always remember
where um my boss interrupted me and she
goes, ""Wow, you love science."" And I was
like, ""What? I don't No, I don't. I I
had never thought about myself as a
person who loved science. You know, from
a young age, I felt like I was sort of
an English social studies type person.""
And uh I it was a moment and but she was
like, ""No, listen to the enthusiasm in
your voice. You love science."" And it
was just a moment that really opened my
eyes and made me think about how much
further science can resonate when it's
focused on stories and the excitement of
discovery. And that was a big
influential moment that I I think about
all the time now doing what we do here
at Crash Course. Uh, and now I'll let
Annie tell some stories about her
journey.
>> Yeah. So, hi, I'm Annie Fillenworth. Um,
I've been at Complexity for three years.
Three amazing years. Really made so many
great things in that time. Um, and yeah,
my background is in creative writing.
Um, I studied creative writing in
undergrad at Fairley Dickson University
in New Jersey. I'm based in Philly now.
Yes, that is City Hall the night the
Eagles won the Super Bowl. Go birds. Um,
and then I earned my masters at the New
School in New York City. Those are some
of our illustrious alums of the writing
for children and young adult program
like Jenny Han and Danielle Clayton. Um,
had a really amazing experience there.
And then, um, I graduated into the
pandemic. Um, which is, you know, no
one's ideal scenario. Um, but I spent
that time also like making things that I
wanted to see. So, I um started a
podcast with my friend Jill where we
talked about um movies and TV shows for
kids from the 2000s. I published some of
my own work and I got my first big girl
job as an editor at a small puzzle books
company uh in suburban the suburban
Philadelphia area. Um and then I started
working at Crash Course. So, I got to
sort of use a lot of my different skills
and niche interests um in this job and
I've worked on a bunch of shows um under
the illustrious guidance of Megan.
>> Awesome. Thank you both. Um so, yeah, if
you I'm going to ask I'm going to ask a
question for the chat first, but then I
would love it if you both could tell us
how a crash course script gets made. And
for all of you watching at home, thank
you for telling me where you're from.
Massachusetts girly. Go birds. Um,
how many people do you think the average
crash course script goes through before
production? We tend to talk about steps
and there's pre-production, production,
when it's filmed, and post-production.
So, but within each of those steps,
there's a lot going on. So, if you have
any guesses about how many people you
think the average Crash Grow script
touches before it goes to be filmed with
the host, go ahead and make your guesses
in the chat and Megan and Annie will
teach us that along the way.
Awesome. So, I'm going to talk a little
bit about what makes a crash course
script. Um, you know, what exactly is
the special sauce of of a crash course
script? And, um, the first thing is that
it needs to be accurate. Um, anytime
you're making educational materials or
tools, that's the bottom line is that we
have to be as accurate as possible. So,
the crash course scripts go through lots
of people to make sure that our scripts
are as accurate as possible. We use um
primary sources and peer-reviewed
research. We have fact checkers, experts
in the field. Um, and we also share our
sources for each of the videos in the
description to make sure we're as
transparent as possible. Um, so that's
like the main thing, but then also you
might know that like we have a crown
coursey tone and um that comes from
trying to be clear, engaging, and
inclusive. So we try to make our videos
as accessible as possible and not use
too much jargon, you know, define terms
when we have them. Um, but make sure
it's like simple language that feels
everyday and conversational and that is
engaging in the way a conversation with
a friend would be. We like to learn
alongside the viewer rather than simply
teach. Um, and our videos also answer
the so what. So, we talk about a lot in
editorial spaces, which is we're
learning something, but why does it
matter? Why should the viewer care that
u we're learning this information? And
that really guides and propels both the
series and each individual script.
Um, and we also build around narrative.
Um, storytelling is really essential to
Crash Course and it helps us remember
the things we learn and put them into
context with our daily lives. So, we'll
talk much more about narrative in a
second, but um, our next um, quality is
that all our scripts are entirely
original. We do not use AI in any of our
creative work. Um, and we make sure
everything is crystal clear, not
plagiarized. Um any script you hear
recited by the host has been um made by
humans which we really pride ourselves
in. Um and our scripts also treat our
audience with honesty, nuance and care.
We want to really imagine that our
audience are the complex people that
they are and try to showcase stories um
and also like hypothetical scenarios
that feel like they represent a wide
variety of people.
And so how does this all start? Um once
we have a series green lit, the first
step is to sort of envision what the
series might look like. And so that
starts with a brainstormed episode list.
We often enlist the help of a subject
matter expert who can help us figure out
what do we want all the episodes to be
about? Um how do we want to convey the
information? What are some possible
hooks and stories that we could use to
express that information? And so this
takes a bit of iteration trying to
figure out, you know, how many episodes
makes the most sense, what do we want to
talk about in each one and sort of a lot
of brainstorming happens at this stage.
And after that, we create a syllabus. So
if you've ever taken a college class,
you know, the first day of class, your
professor shows up and hands you a piece
of paper that details what the whole
course is going to cover. And that's
what we use as sort of an internal guide
for um our for our our videos um and to
help our writers uh script their uh
videos. So the syllabus is basically a
really fleshed out episode list. We have
things like the course description, the
learning objectives, and then we break
down each script um topic into subtopics
and put in all of the actual concrete
information that we want to convey. So,
we'll have things like key terms, but
also fun stuff like special segments or
also misconceptions we want to make sure
that we address or don't fall into. Um,
and then that is sort of the framework
that the writer uses to create their
first draft.
And so that takes a lot of research on
their part, looking through all of the
uh sources that are linked in the
syllabus and figuring out how to build a
story around that information. And so
after that it goes through many rounds
of edits including through me through
Megan and eventually after going through
a fact checker and a producer and the
host it becomes a real actual video. Um
shout out to Latin American literature
which is airing now.
Okay so here's the answer to the
question. A it does range, but somewhere
around 8 to 10 plus people work on every
crash course script. And that's just the
script. You should more than double it
once you start to get into the video
elements and the animation elements.
Sometimes we have uh you know
illustrator like for Native American
history, we have illustrators who are
from indigenous cultures and things like
that. And then that um that adds more
and more collaborators which is is
something that uh is so fun and and
rewarding for us and we hope it is for
the audience as well. Um so I'm going to
show you I know you can't see this. Uh
and I kind of wanted to show it to you
this way just to emphasize like it
doesn't fit on a slide. The crash course
script process is so elaborate it
doesn't really fit on a slide. But I am
going to sort of um zoom in for you and
show you a a high level of our full sort
of flowchart of how a crash course
script gets made. Um so I'm going to try
to zoom in. Um basically we start once
yeah like Annie said once we decide to
make a series the first thing we do is
we hire a subject matter expert. That's
going to take a few months. Then we move
into a sort of curriculum development
phase. So, we're taking several weeks to
develop an episode list, like a
highlevel outline, like she talked
about. Then, we're taking several more
weeks to fill out that outline with
sources, with story ideas, etc. If we
have a funding partner, of course,
there's back and forth during that part.
Um, finally, once the syllabus is
complete, we move into scripting. And I
don't expect you I'm just sort of taking
you through this just to give you a
sense of the scope. Obviously, there's
not going to be a pop quiz at the end.
Um but yeah, then we move into a first
draft. We have our subject matter expert
review every single draft to make sure
that we've gotten everything right at a
high level. We have uh multiple edits.
So first we have like a developmental
edit which is more focused on story and
priorities. You know, did we spend
enough time on one thing and too much
time on another thing? Things like that.
Then we have the the lead editor do a
second edit. Um and then uh things get
passed to different types of
stakeholders. The script gets passed to
different types of stakeholders. So, we
send the script to our producers and our
producers are really focused on like
like I always tell this story that one
time um in our religion series, we had
an introduction that was about uh a
small community who experienced what
felt to this community at this church
like to be a miracle. And it was that
there was a painting on their church and
it it like started dripping oil and they
were like, ""This is a miracle, a modern
miracle."" Um, and I was like, ""Oh, this
is such an exciting place to start the
script."" And the producer was like,
""Okay, but what are they going to see on
screen? It's lit. It's a wall. You want
you want people to look at a wall, just
a blank a wall. It it's it's as it's
almost paint drying. That's what you're
asking for."" So, [laughter]
the producers bring a really different
perspective than what we might be
thinking about on the editorial side,
and that's really helpful. We also have
our host review the scripts and change
up little jokes and references to make
it more personal to them. And then fact
check, copy edit. So that's when we go
back through to make sure um you know
just polish everything, make sure we're
not being too redundant, make sure
everything feels sensitive. And then
finally we get to the table read which
is a sort of a rehearsal with our host.
But I will move off of this annoying and
difficult to look at Figma board. um and
move back to our deck if I can. Let's
see.
>> Cool. And I feel like now is a great
time while you while you do that, Megan,
looking at all those people on all those
stages.
>> Um I just want to thank Crash Course is
free. Uh Crash Course is free for
everyone and is meant to be accessible.
And so I want to thank Shannon Alexander
and Tia Hazard for donating. This part
of the reason we're doing this for
Learnathon is to make sure that Crash
Course will always be free. So, thank
you all for being here and thank you for
for supporting what what these guys do.
Um, cool. And so, oh, can you still hear
me? I just lost one headphone. Um, so
moving forward, Annie, you had mentioned
that we're going to talk more about
narrative. Um, and so let's go ahead and
talk that. How do you take this
commitment to accuracy, all this
research that you're doing, and then
turn it into a compelling story that
people are going to not only be
interested in watching, but also that
will help stay in their minds? And um I
just before I actually pass it over to
you, uh some questions that came up that
are related to that is do you follow
like a certain kind of style guide um
and how does that interact with with
that process? Yeah, we have our own
style guide that we sort of adhere to,
but it's also sort of in flux. We don't
necessarily we're not strictly AP or
Chicago or anything like that. Also,
because the information is imparted
verbally, so you can't really see the
text anyway, but we do have a style
guide that helps us keep things in order
um on our end.
>> Awesome. Uh so yeah, big big picture we
something we really think about when
we're trying to figure out how to make
it all a story. Uh we ask ourselves the
these three questions. What am I
learning that I didn't know before?
What's making me feel something? And
what's my genuine journey of discovery?
Um almost all of the time our writers
are not experts on the subject. And so
when we give them this these syllabi,
they are genuinely reading information,
digesting things, synthesizing
information for the first time, learning
a lot of things for the first time. And
that means that we get frustrated
sometimes. We get confused. We're
grasping for like analogies and
metaphors to try to latch on to
something we already know. And then
sometimes those fall apart and we have
to start again. that whole process of
learning um it happens to us and every
time we try to write a crash course
script and you know when you grow up
when you go to school you learn to hide
that whole part of the writing process
and just document okay I've sorted it
out and let me put the clean and
finished part on the page but what we
try to do is really hold on to what were
the highs and lows of my journey to
understanding this information what were
the twists and turns the moments where I
fell into a misconception or got
confused and how did I sort of resolve
that and we try to build a story from
that.
Um, and I I think this is like an
extremely nerdy thing to say, but I I
think I can prove it to you. um that it
it seems crazy to say that we would we
take our journey of discovery and make
it like a plot, but um I'm going to show
you how we you can really layer a crash
course script onto this is like a common
plot structure. I pulled this from the
legendary comedy training center upright
Citizens Brigade. This is their um this
is like an adapted version of their plot
structure for like a TV show pilot, like
a comedy TV show pilot. But I'm going to
show you how um a crash course script
defining and the nerdy concept of what
is a species actually kind of fits into
this TV pilot format. Um so we'll start
with fun. Open with something fun,
interesting, and relatable. So this is
an example from a real crash course
script. A sleepy bassad hound and a
tireless border collie look and act like
they're from different planets, but they
can have a weird looking litter of
puppies that can make more puppies.
That's because they're the same species.
But meanwhile, if you cross a zebra and
a horse, you'll get a bundle of joy
known as a zorse, which is a hybrid. But
sadly, that source can't have more Zorse
babies because horses and zebras are
different species. So okay, organis two
organisms are considered members of the
same species if they can mate and make
fertile offspring.
Okay, but we encounter a frustration
right off the bat. Life has been known
to break these rules. Like there are
some hybrids that can reproduce. You
might know some of them without knowing
you know them. Like if you've ever had a
plumcot from the grocery store, but
there are also hybrid animals that can
reproduce, including this hybrid lizard
species. Uh, and females actually don't
even need a mate to do so. So, that
completely breaks the definition of
species that I just gave to you. We've
hit a snag. We've hit our first conflict
in our plot.
Okay. Well, then the next the next part
of the story structure is having a a new
plan, a false victory. Okay. So, because
of exceptions like the plumcot and that
lizard, uh, other scientists think it's
better to define species by their
genealogy. According to this idea, all
organisms in the same evolutionary
lineage are one species.
Oops. But that gets complicated for a
bunch of reasons, including that there
are literally billions of extinct
species that are pretty tough to learn
about and to link with living ones. So,
this concept really isn't perfect
either. And we really things escalate.
We fall into chaos with our plot when we
also consider, okay, here's another way
to think about species. Uh what if we
parse them based on environmental
conditions like how polar bears live in
a different type of habitat than grizzly
bears? Well, that starts to fall apart
as soon as you consider any number of
species that live in more than one
environment. And at this point, we might
want to level with our audience. We say,
if all of this feels confusing to you,
you're actually on to something. In real
life, it's really difficult to pin down
what makes a species. And every single
definition of species that scientists
have come up with is imperfect.
But we still have to resolve it somehow.
Uh and ultimately we land on well humans
make knowledge by categorizing things
even if those categories aren't as
rockolid as we wish they were. Um so our
systems for naming and classifying
things are totally imperfect and at the
same time super super useful. Having
working death species definitions lets
us compare and contrast things notice
what they have in common. But it's also
really really interesting when those
things break and that helps us learn
more about the world and about how
nature works.
Awesome. Thanks Megan. Um and if any
questions come up feel free to drop them
in the chat. Um, and yes, that we had
talked earlier about the different steps
and writing, research and writing, and
now we're getting to editing some of the
invisible work that goes into this. Um,
and then we had a question from earlier.
I just want to highlight um that came up
from Tass. Thank you, Tass, for asking
this. And as you're telling us more
about editing, Annie, if you want to
tell us, does Crash Course have a
plagiarism check used to make sure that
someone's not accidentally plagiarizing
or maybe one of your writers is is
plagiarizing? And what is your process
for dealing with potential potential
plagiarism and the editing process?
>> Yeah, that's a great question. Um,
towards the end of the editing process,
we run through all of our scripts uh
through Grammarly. They have a great
plagiarism check function um that checks
it alongside many many many pages and
documents on the internet. Um and
fortunately we have like a lot of people
with good integrity on our team. So I
don't know if we've ever come across
anything that's been remotely close.
Sometimes it might be like this sentence
is really close to this sentence and
then it's like a quote. Um, [laughter]
so sometimes you might need to like
reward a sentence if it just came too
close to an original source, but the
vast majority of the time there are no
problems. Um, especially because of how
many edits we go through, it's just so
far from the source by then that
plagiarism isn't really a concern. But,
uh, if there ever were a concern, we
would probably address it pretty
swiftly. Um, but fortunately, I haven't
run into that problem.
Um, but yeah, we can get started talking
about editing. So, something we thought
might be a good idea to talk about today
is specifically editing a crash course
intro. Um, intros are super important.
The first 30 seconds are essential to a
video. If you're uh you've ever uploaded
anything to YouTube, you know about how
long it takes for a view to count. And
then also it's what helps us get the
attention right away, get it engaged,
and then move through and set up the
rest of the video. Um, so yeah, the
first 30 seconds are super important.
And we're going to um talk about some of
the common pitfalls that we see when we
are editing um crash courseware scripts.
So, the first common issue is when an
intro meanders. Um, so you can pull up
that intro, Megan. Um, so this is an
original intro for a script for Crash
Course Sexed. And the first thing you
might notice is that it's pretty long
for 30 seconds. It's kind of a lot of
information. Um, and it's covering a lot
of great stuff in context, but that's
not usually what the function of the
intro is. We're more trying to grab
attention. an intriguing concept or
question. And so a lot of this
information is stuff that would better
suit later on in the script. Um, even
the fun joke we have at the end about
how to pronounce LGBTQIA, it's not quite
going to hit in an intro. So we decided
to take things in a different direction
for our edited version. And so where we
came to was talking about our host
Sham's first crush. So, first crushes
are a pretty common experience and we're
able to relate to the audience and have
them reflect on their own experiences by
starting there. And also, it's kind of
juicy. Like, it's a little bit gossipy.
It's got that fun big sister feel that
we were really shooting for with our
host for Sex Ed. Um, and so we just sort
of connected some barebones ideas and
then allowed Shan to come in and add her
personal experiences. And that really
lightened the tone. it kind of brought
us into a very complex idea which is
what is sexuality um by talking about
something really relatable and easy to
understand and um added some punchy
questions to get us into the rest of the
script.
So the next common issue is burying the
lead. So obviously when we're we have an
intro we want to start with a punch and
this story is super interesting from
Native American history. We're talking
about a tribe that was arguably very
successful and then something happened.
They got terminated by the federal
government and things really went
downhill very quickly for them. Um, so
it's a really interesting story, but
honestly the most interesting part is
the sentence right before Chang's
introduction where he says uh at the
dawning of the termination era that's
exactly what makes them a target. So we
thought why don't we move some things
around to try to make this um more
interesting. So in our final version, we
started with that idea, shifted it to
the top and said things were looking up
for the Monomony tribe of Wisconsin and
that's exactly what made them a target.
So immediately we feel a little bit more
suspense, a little bit more intrigue
just by moving one sentence and then we
keep that same context, but now we have
a reason to be interested and then just
kind of put a bow on it at the end by
saying, you know, the Monomony had a
safety net, but it was about to break.
So, we're able to really build suspense
in um the intro just by shifting a few
parts around.
Um and our Oh, go ahead, Kayla.
>> Um awesome. Just Nope, you keep going. I
will I'll add this one next. I thought I
thought there was natural pause. You
keep going. Sorry. Right.
>> No worries. Um and uh our last common
issue that we'll talk about today is
when there isn't enough feeling. So,
intros, part of what makes them grabby
is um connecting to human emotion. And
so this is from an episode of Crash
Course Religions about cults. And it's
fun. It's got a great light-hearted
tone, a sort of, you know, relatable
concept of what do we think of when we
think of the word cults. Um, but it's a
little bit generic and it could probably
pack a little bit more of a punch. So,
we decided to shake things up a little
bit in our edited version where we sort
of put the viewer themselves into a
scenario. We said, ""Picture this. You're
in a cozy room surrounded by people
welcoming you with good food and
kindness. They're showing interest in
your questions, your anxieties, and you
hold on a second. Is this a cult? So, it
sort of, you know, lulls the viewer into
a sense of safety and comfort and then
disrupts that immediately that sort of
counterintuition is something we often
use in our episodes. Um, and also it
tackles that kind of relatable question
that a lot of people ask themselves,
which is like, would I fall for a cult?
It's kind of a an intriguing juicy
question. Um, and then we tacked on a
bit of a punchier end to that as well by
saying, can we really tell the
difference between a religion and a
cult? So, we sort of tightened things up
and made them a little bit more packing
a punch. Um, and just heightened it. You
know, the original intro was fine and
great, but we were able to make it even
better. And so, you know, these are just
intros, but we apply a lot of these same
tactics to the rest of the script as
well to make things engaging by adding
hypothetical scenarios and jokes and
personal reflections from the host. All
these things can kind of tie together
the whole episode. Um, but the intro is
where that sort of shines right at the
start.
>> Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And then a
question that came up um that was sort
of timely when talking about sexed is
from Rachel and
Rachel's question is did theme
um but I think this was actually about
the host because sometimes the subject
matter expert and the host are different
people. Um but did the host write the
intro about their crush or did a writer
write it from their perspective? And I
feel like that leads in really nicely to
this next section about balancing all
that information with making it fun and
funny. Um, and then just want to add one
more question on there because Lucy Lid
sort of anticipated this next coming up
as well and asked, ""Do you have any
advice or resources converting
complicated educational materials in a
conversational tone?"" I think you'll
kind of answer this one naturally, but
just wanted to put those out there as
you're as you're talking about this next
one. Yeah, and I can speak to that.
Yeah, that sex ed intro. Um, yeah, so
Sham was our host. We had a different
subject matter expert. Um, but we did um
sort of build a framework. Sometimes
we'll we'll write a section of a script
where we say something like in brackets,
you know, TK, which is the sort of
journalist uh shortand for to come. Um,
uh, host experiences. So I think what we
had in our sort of intervening episode
uh uh edit of this um intro was you know
my first crush
name um and then
>> something etc etc and then uh I think we
had sort of added the stuff about being
boy obsessed and
>> boy bands because we had also talked to
Shan um before we started scripting
about her personality and experiences so
we could sort of fill in a little bit of
the gaps with what we already knew about
her and then she was able provide the
specifics later. So, the hosts
definitely have um a chance to add their
sort of flare to the episodes um as they
review them before we ship them.
>> Yeah. And I would say I think my best
advice for making complicated
information easy to understand is really
um tr
what it was like when you first learned
it. And that can be really hard if you
know it really well. But if you can put
yourself back in in that space of
learning something fresh and what
surprised you, what subverted your
expectations, what confused you, then I
think that helps. Um, I think oftentimes
when we know something really well, we
skip a lot of steps in explaining it
because they just seem obvious. And if
you can like think back to, you know,
sitting in that freshman year classroom
where something really hooked you for
the first time um and and try to or or
if you can't like talk to a person who
doesn't know about it, I think is really
good advice. We often if in some cases
if we do have an expert writer, it's all
the more important that we don't have an
expert editor. We we always want uh lay
someone who's editing the script to be a
lay person relative to the script
subject matter. Thankfully, that's
really easy at Crash Course because we
do a crash course on every possible
subject and no one can be an expert on
every possible subject. But yeah, I
would say making sure someone is is
genuinely learning it for the first time
uh can react to that to your work on it
and that helps a lot. Okay, I'm going to
click back forward. I had took us back
to that um intro when we were talking
about that. But this is another big
question we get about making things fun
and funny. And I'm going to talk a
little bit about here about just like
how we think about humor here at Crash
Course. Um so I'll start with just some
like basic principles of humor writing
that are true for any type of humor
writing. The first is that quantity is
the key to quality. the best comedy
writers invisibly write dozens and
hundreds and and hundreds of bad jokes,
but you only see the best ones.
[laughter]
And so sometimes we're really hard on
ourselves uh because we're like, man, I
wrote five jokes and they're all bad. Um
but that's because we're imagining we're
not imagining the intense failure rate
that real comedians are experiencing and
just filtering before it gets to us. Um,
related to that, we work hard on our
team to make space for there to be a
clown mode and an edit mode. And what I
mean by that is that we try to create
space in clown mode where we don't judge
ourselves where we say the bad idea
because maybe the bad idea will spark
something in someone else that leads to
a good idea. And if we never say the bad
idea, then we never get to the quantity,
which is the key to the quality, right?
like you got to clear out all the bad
ideas in order to make space for the
good ideas. And um yeah, then later
there's edit mode where you are
identifying, okay, this one joke out of
the 50 options is the best one and
you're culling. And these are incredibly
self- sustaining. You can only be brave
enough to and vulnerable enough to have
a clown mode if you know that later
there will be the edit mode so your bad
ideas won't be showcased. you know these
are you really need both uh in order to
have like a successful humor team. Um
and the other thing I would say is take
stock of your toolbox. Um there are all
kinds of humor tools. Um humor is very
very often formulaic. It's based on
repeated and predictable techniques that
are going to work again and again in new
contexts. Um, and so just to give you
some examples, I there are different
different types of toolboxes that
everybody can have based on your unique
context. Um, so I'll tell you a little
bit about the crash course toolbox for
humor.
One question we ask ourselves if we feel
like something is not funny enough is,
can we add some physical action? For us,
uh, the cra the expectation of the
viewer is that the host is going to be
sitting at the desk. They're a talking
head. So, anytime we can put them in a
new space or interacting with the world
in a new way, that's going to surprise
people and that adds an element of
humor. Um, so in this case, in Native
American history, we're talking about
busting myths about about Native
American people. And um rather than just
talking about that as a metaphor, we
took it real literally and we have him
putting the myths into a bottle and then
smashing them with a bat. Um, so fun.
Uh, another thing we ask ourselves is
would it help to have a character say
it? Again, both of these are these are
pretty sensitive examples. Um, here's uh
this is from the religions series. Uh,
and we wanted to think about how can we
talk about religious misconceptions
which are essentially they're
stereotypes about people, sometimes
marginalized groups. um how can we talk
about those um but not in a way that
feels overly preachy or judgmental. And
it really helped to add a character. So
we had created this character called the
devil's advocate. We had him FaceTime
John um our host and wear a tracksuit
and a headset and just be like the least
likable person um so that we could then
correct those misconceptions in a more
playful way. Another thing uh ties right
back to what Annie was talking about
with our sexed um intro example earlier,
but it's one thing if that if that intro
had been focused on um we all have
crushes. That's fine. But uh a good
comedy principle is like it's better to
have don't talk about a scene somewhere
in the future or somewhere in the past.
Bring bring it to here. Bring it make it
more specific and bring it to here. So
we're talking about Devon. We're talking
about Shan's crush, Devon. Devon is in
the room with us and that really helps a
lot.
Visuals and sound effects. We love Oh,
we love a Christopher Columbus with a
single tear down his cheek. We love uh
hashtag team Jacob. Little little visual
or sound effect moments that can punch
up a video. Camera angles and video
editing techniques. Here you have Chay
making a joke about um the the words
that he prefers to refer to himself as.
He likes the word indigenous. He also
likes the words handsome and brave. And
we get a little bit of a closeup and a
side angle to show that he's being a
little cheeky.
Um cool. I just uh I want to check on
the timing. Caitlyn, are we are we
having a lot of questions? Should I?
>> We have um we have about 15 minutes left
and we I have a decent list of questions
we could go over. Um and but yeah, let's
see. Um I think is it is the exercise
you want to do about three minutes? Is
that right?
>> Yeah, sure. We could do that exercise.
Yeah,
>> I think we could do that. Um
>> maybe we can. Yeah, let's walk us. Yeah,
go for it. has a an exercise for us that
we can do before we get into more
questions.
>> Yeah. Yeah. So, one really really easy
tip for making a joke a little bit
better is putting the funny part last.
And you may have heard of the rule of
three, uh, which is a really good
example of putting the funny part last.
So, the rule of three is a type of joke
where you create a pattern or
expectation and then you immediately
break it. So the audience thinks they
know what's coming and then you
immediately break it. So in this case we
have I love Christmas. What's not to
love? Presents, family, and the crushing
realization that the joy of childhood is
gone forever, right? It's it's just like
a very simple formula that anyone anyone
can come up with and you can you can
play with again and again. So I did want
to do a little chat challenge. Um I'd
love to challenge you to write a joke in
three minutes using the rule of three.
Um and I'm going to give you a prompt.
The prompt is birthday parties. And the
way you're going to do this is you're
going to just take I will set a timer.
Kaitlyn will set a timer for 3 minutes.
You're going to make a list of things
that pop into your head that go with
birthday parties. But and then you're
going to have to think of one thing that
relates to birthday parties but sparks a
really different feeling than the rest.
So the format could be like birthday
parties are great, normal thing, normal
thing, weird thing. And then we'd love
to see your answers in the chat. Uh this
is clown mode. So we're all brave
because one another is brave, right? Uh
we're all on a limb together. There is
bad ideas are going to are going to get
us to good ideas. So I challenge you to
be vulnerable with us. Uh and we'll set
a timer for three minutes.
All right, timer's going. We are in kind
of quiet mode. If you have a piece of
paper or your computer in front of you,
go ahead and start start writing writing
down your ideas. Thank you so much for
Aunt Crystal for getting us started with
that very quickwitted [music]
uh example.
And I'll bring us back from this quiet
mode gently in about a minute in about
two and a half minutes.
Hey,
hey, hey.
All right, I'm going to bring us back.
Thank you all so much for dropping
these. Megan and Annie, do you want to
read a couple that stood out to you and
maybe
talk about them? These are all I don't
feel like there were any duds. You all
are so funny. [laughter]
>> They're all so good. You're so funny. I
I'm The first one I I'm gonna see if I
can find it. H candles cake and a
candycoated realization that you're
hurdling toward death. So good. So, I
candycoated realization. [laughter]
So good. I love it. I love it. Annie,
did you have a favorite?
>> Yeah, I I really liked um Jen Marker's
birthday parties are great. Cake,
friends, and watching people sing to you
while you sit silently. So true. So
true. So relatable.
I also just want to shout out Ellipsu.
It's Ellipsu's 18th birthday tomorrow.
So, happy birthday. I'm so glad you're
spending part of your birthday week with
us.
>> Yes. Happy birthday. Happy birthday. You
guys are so brave. Thank you for Thank
you for playing with us. It was really
really fun to see your jokes. Um I'll
just we'll just quickly wrap up and then
we'll transition into slidesh into more
FAQs. Um we saw this in your joke
examples, but other ways to finaness a
joke is to think about contrast. Um, so
in the I love Christmas joke example,
having the presents the be as far as
possible away from the joy of childhood
being gone forever. If it was like
presents, family, and like being a
little tired, then that's not that's not
as funny because the contrast is too
small. I think that I think the person
who wrote about candy coded h hurtling
toward death intuitively understood that
that was a good contrast. Um, another
thing is being being more specific. Um,
so a specific detail is always funnier
than a broad description. That's why I
think we've all heard this in different
circumstances. It's always funny to just
like give a character a random name.
Thanks a lot, Robert. Do we know who
Robert is? Doesn't matter. It's just
funny because sudden it's more specific.
Um, so these are just kind of quick
quick um joke improvements. And the last
thing I would always say is ask your
friends. Humor is social. There's
nothing harder than sitting with a page
by yourself trying to be funny. There's
nothing more depressing. Um, but with
people, uh, really really helps and
that's that's what we do here on the
Crash Course team and here with you
today. So, thank you so much.
>> Awesome. Awesome. Thank you. Um, so
yeah, now we're gonna we have about 10
more minutes, little little less. So, we
have time to talk about your questions.
Some of you have already put some in the
chat, which thank you so much. Um, if
you have more, feel free to drop them
in. And if you have more jokes, feel
free to drop them in. Um, so the first
one I wanted to start with is from
Finara, and you've talked about this a
little bit, but I love the specificity
of this question too, and thought you
um, we could talk about it a little bit
more. So, for influential but
problematic figures in a topic, for
example, Salvador Dolli in art history,
how do you decide what to explain about
them and what to admit for time or
clarity? or what are some other ways
potentially that you bring up that topic
like you were talking about with um with
some other series?
Would Megan or Annie you want to take
it? Go for it Annie.
>> Sure. Um yeah and and Megan feel free to
add your thoughts too. Um this is
something we talk about all of the time
um because unfortunately there are a lot
of problematic figures that uh we learn
about various topics. Um I think part of
it has to do with tone. We try not to
sort of valorize those people um or
overly praise them for their
contributions. Sometimes we'll just
present it factually. Um and it's really
a case- by case basis. Sometimes it
feels relevant to say and by the way
this person is not great for XYZ reason
or you know keep in mind this other
thing. Um, and also sometimes it's about
really letting them be a footnote and
talking about somebody else who um
doesn't have as scarred a reputation uh
is from a marginalized background or an
underrepresented community um because a
lot of their contributions tend to not
be um highlighted in a lot of curricula.
So sometimes there's room to say um this
person in science was a eugenicist. So
take everything they say with a grain of
salt. But this person over here was
doing something really interesting with
DNA or something like that where we can
sort of highlight news stories from
people that we don't know about. Um but
also sometimes it's even just a footnote
in the description like we're aware that
this person is iffy because of XYZ
reason a resource to learn more about
it. So it really depends on the scenario
I think.
>> Awesome. And then Finn Brener just
asked, ""Does a host ever make changes to
the script on set?"" In my experience,
I've never had that not happen. Uh but
I' which we love our hosts for that. Uh
um and but I wondered too if you could
talk about maybe some examples and maybe
talk more about the um the read through
um the table and and that process and
how that helps with that. Yeah, we have
a lot of structures in place to try to
help the host give input a number of
times before we're on set because we
used to have the host make more changes
on set and we're really open to it
because that's when a lot of playfulness
can come out, but um we've fact checked
everything and sometimes things are so
so subtle and you lose the word 'the'
and suddenly it's not exactly correct
anymore. And um so it's hard to like
kind of flag those things on the spot.
So, uh, a couple of things we do, like
Annie alluded to earlier, one thing we
do, um, is when we have a new host, we
have like an interview with them where
we talk about like what are your
embarrassing stories? What's your family
like? Do you have pets? What's a weird
opinion you have about the world? Um, so
we try to get, you know, an
understanding of what makes them tick.
And then we we write some jokes with
them and with that in mind. And with
then we leave we also leave a lot of uh
placeholders for them. Um, like Annie
mentioned, um, then they review the
scripts in advance. They fill in the
placeholders. We encourage them to react
to other parts of the script as well.
So, we often get new suggestions for
intros from hosts, new suggestions for
um, you know, anecdotes, things like
that um, at that stage. And then, yeah,
then we do what we call a table read.
It's it's a remote table read. We're all
around a virtual table, but there's
going to be the producer, the script
editor, and the host all in a room
reading through the scripts. And in
those moments, um, we notice when the
host, if they stumble repeatedly over a
line, then it's probably the line, it's
probably not them. Um, so we'll take a
moment and we'll revise that line to
make it sound more natural for them. Um,
also those are moments where sometimes
if a joke doesn't quite land in real
time, we'll we'll toss the ball around
trying to make the joke a little bit
funnier. Um, if something or just
something feels wrong, um, then we'll
make a note to cut it or to rephrase it.
Um then yeah, when we get on set, we can
never and we would never want to fully
um get rid of host changes on set, but
we try to have like one word perfect
recording and then one recording with
improvisations. So that way if later
when we're going through uh we notice
that there's a factual discrepancy, we
have a take with the word perfect
version that we can substitute in for
that portion.
Thank you. Um, cool. And then we had a
couple questions about working with fact
checker fact checkers and subject matter
experts. So, I'm just going to read a
couple of them and and we can have a
little bit of a conversation about it.
So, Syjoy asks, ""Hi, Syd. Hi,
Jacqueline. Is there anything you do in
the writing process to make it easier
for the fact checker, especially if info
is from the subject matter expert and
not a primary reference?"" what what
happens in that situation. And then
Sarah J also asked, ""How many subject
matter experts do you reach out to when
fact-checking and developing the script?
Does it vary by topic?""
>> Yeah, I can jump in. Um, yeah,
factchecking is is its own animal. Um,
but part of what our scripting process
is like is is keeping the sources with
the claims as long as possible in the
script version. So the way that we sort
of structure scripts literally from the
first draft that the writer does is that
the last punctuation of a sentence, we
have a comment in our Google doc where
they link the source and the the sort of
text from that source where that claim
came from. And so those comments are all
visible to the fact checker when they go
in and do their fact check and they're
finding independent sources that back
those claims up. So, we're able to sort
of give them a place of like this is
where this idea came from. Um, the fact
checker might be able to say, ""Hey, that
source is actually outdated or there's a
newer paper that has more accurate
information now or that was debunked a
while ago."" Um, and so we can sort of
keep track of where the claims came
from. Um, and yeah, we always have the
subject matter expert that we have sort
of developed the series with from day
one. Um, but we also might bring in
other people who have specific areas of
expertise. This happened a lot with um,
religions and Native American history.
So, when there's particular groups or
experiences that we want to make sure
that um, we're getting right, but the
subject matter expert is more of a
generalist. So, that kind of um, yeah,
very serious series to series.
>> Awesome. Thanks, Annie. And I think this
might be our last question, but before
we move on, I wanted to shout out Brooke
in the chat who also mentioned script
supervisors. Thank you, Brooke, for
asking about that. And then thank you
again to all of for all of you for being
here. And thank you to those of you who
donated to help make sure Crash Course
is always free for everyone. Um, and so
this is two questions um that I'm
grouping together kind of like I did
with the fact checker.
is um
is about visuals. Katie Hoben early on
asked, ""Could you tell us more about how
you think about explanation versus
animation in your courses? What type of
content is best supported by visual
assets?"" And then Lucy Lids asked, ""When
writing the script, do you include
visual descriptions as you go or later?""
>> Yeah, this is these are really good
questions. Um when we think about
animation we I mean we have to think
about it any anybody would from like a
sort of budget perspective. Animation is
in and illustration is incredibly
resource intensive. We have incredible
um animators and illustrators here uh on
the crash course team. Shout out to
them. Um so we do have to look at a
script and think about like what are the
parts that are the most difficult to
understand without a really clear
visual. And usually that is either that
they're very technical um so we're
thinking like the parts of the cell or
something like that where you you know
you can't keep track of there's what 30
different organels you can't you just
can't put that in your head um or very
very abstract um so if we're thinking
about like uh you know like uh the
origin stories of Hinduism or something
like that um that are we don't ne that
the average viewer might not necessarily
necessarily have um anything to bring up
in their imagination when we come up
with it. Then we need to put something
on screen to mix up make it a little bit
more concrete. Or with our political
theory series, when we talk about like
liberalism or another philosophical
concept, we have to kind of take
something abstract and make it concrete
often with a metaphor or a character or
sometimes just like a graphic organizer
like a ven diagram or a chart or
something like that. That helps us keep
track of we're comparing different
concepts. We're thinking of this concept
falls within this broader concept and
helps the viewers make a mental map. The
other thing we think about is the
availability of B-roll. Um, and oh, I
think [laughter] I think I have to stop
talking because we're going to have a
nice live stream. But if there's real
life, uh, if we can license photographic
or video, um, graphics instead of
animation, then that helps a lot. And
that it does tend to come after the
initial script. um just because there's
so much content to get through in the
initial script that we have a later pass
where we're we're thinking more about
visuals and it does end up adding some
real significant revisions to the
script.
>> I just wanted to shout out that we have
a whole uh stream coming up about
animation and editing in Crash Course.
So, if you're curious about how that
stuff happens, uh you should uh join us
on Wednesday.
Thank you, Laser
Megan. Yeah. So, you don't I just want
to flag we are at the half hour when we
were scheduled to end. Um, so if you
were planning your day around this and
you have to be in a meeting, thank you
so much for coming. Um, and then any uh
Megan, did you get to answer completely?
Did you feel?
>> Yes. Yes. [laughter] I thought that that
>> Thank you for sharing that laser. I
thought that it was like automatically
going to roll into the next live stream.
[laughter] So that's that's why I got I
did that, but [clears throat] you were
getting off yesterday.
>> Yeah, exactly. I thought you were
hooking me with the um with the old
cane, but I'm glad to hear that you
weren't. [laughter]
And thank you so much everybody. These
are amazing questions. It's been really
really fun to hang out with you this
hour.
>> Yeah, thank you all. And thank you Megan
and Annie for putting this presentation
together and all the amazing work you
do. Thank you to Laser for organizing
all of Learnathon. Thank you to all of
you. There's no there is no Complexity
without the community that surrounds it.
So, this is so special. So, thank you
all for being here and don't forget to
check out more of what's going on at
complex at complexitylearnathathon.com
and laser put this in the chat, but you
can join at complexity.storepagesathon
to keep crash course free forever. And
JB, you missed the whole thing. You got
to be here for the very end. Um, so I'm
so glad you joined and this will be
uploaded later. So if you came in late
or just want to watch it again, you can
watch this later. Um, and I believe
it'll be on youtube.com/complexity.
Thank you all for joining us. Thanks
Megan and thanks everybody.
>> Y"
3V78r1y2EHs,"Welcome to the jungle. Is it a paradise
or a nightmare? A place that'll take
care of you or destroy you? For
centuries, we Latin Americans have
recognized Mama Nature's main character
energy. She can be kind and generous or
dangerous and chaotic. Sounds like a
Pisces, am I right?
Anyways, in literature, Mama Nature
doesn't just spill the tea about plants
and animals, water, and rocks. She
represents the wildness of people, too.
So, what can literature about nature
tell us about us? Hi, I'm Kurly
Velasquez and this is Crash Course Latin
American Literature.
Let's start. A few millennia ago,
indigenous people knew Mama Nature first
and they knew her well. The people of
the Andes called her Bachamama. And the
Populvu, the collection of sacred
narratives of the Kiche people, name
drops their whole natural neighborhood.
Macaus, gaka, coyotes, calabash trees,
romeilads, [music] and hagarundis. The
Incas of what's now Peru regarded the
sun as [music] an ancestor and a god,
often depicted as a flaming disc with a
human face. And to this day, many
indigenous peoples view the land as
physically and spiritually connected to
themselves. It's not just a bunch of
rocks and dirt. Fast forward to the late
15th century, and European colonizers
were pretty blown away by the Latin
American landscape. Christopher Columbus
praised the Americas for its soft
breezes, high mountains, and fertile
lands. Get out of here, Chris. The
Spanish botist Gonzalo Fernandez Oedo
gushed over everything good to eat
there. Iguana delicious prickly pear
it'll turn your pee red tmi Gonzalo but
the colonizers attitude wasn't on this
land we all fam it was more like what's
yours is mine for three centuries
European colonizers seized control of
this vast landscape violently forcing
out indigenous peoples and the ways they
viewed their environment though to be
clear indigenous folks are still very
much part of Latin America today and the
rest of the world in the 19th century
Latin Americans rose up through
independence movements transforming
colonies into nation states and those
nation states had to grapple with big
questions like who are we now and who
are we going to be in relation to this
land. Some 19th century writers like the
Venezuelan Chilean poet Andres Beo drew
inspiration from the European romantics
who tied passionate emotions to the
natural world. While living in England,
Beo wrote the epic poem Silva Ala
agricultura deona toida, agriculture in
the torid zone. It oozes with idealism
about the landscape back home. Beo
addresses the land directly, lovingly
even, with lines like, ""You give sweet
sugar cane whose pure sap makes the
world disdain the honeycomb."" But Beo
also claims there's a responsibility
involved to place the fertile soil now
harsh and wild under the unaccustomed
yoke of human skill and conquer it. Keep
your yoke away from patcha mama baleo.
As the 19th and 20th centuries unfolded,
many Latin American writers distanced
themselves from the European romantics
idealism toward the wilderness. Instead,
they invoked the Yanos plains and the
pampas grasslands as backwards places.
In them, nature wasn't quaint and the
jungle wasn't paradise. It was
dangerous, menacing, and it held dark
secrets about who people really were.
Let's get the curly notes on Labor, The
Vortex, a 1924 novel by Colombian author
Joseio Ria. It's a prime example of
regionalism, a style of literature where
the place the story occurs is as richly
detailed as the characters themselves.
Baja Mama isn't just the backdrop for
human drama. She is the drama.
Lavahina is presented as the diary of a
fictional poet named Aruro Kova who fled
the city for the Yanos then the jungle
and then disappeared without a trace. I
mean except this detailed account of
everything that went down. And boy did
this guy have feelings about the jungle.
Oh jungle wed to silence. Mother of
solitude and mist. What malignant
[music] spirit left me to languish in
your emerald prison?
Oh jungle, let me escape your sickly
shadows, your living cemetery, your
primordial kingdom of agony and
resuscitation. In Labor, the jungle is
one mean place, a vortex of nothingness
where humanity falls away and chaos
prevails. In the jungle, Koba meets
enemies of all kinds. Parasites,
leeches, and people enslaving other
people through the rubber industry. He
finds no kindness, only evil, even in
himself. As literary critic Gene Franco
puts it, if Lavorina has a message,
[music] it is that nature is more
powerful than civilization in Latin
America. Meaning, not just nature in the
literal sense, but also the chaos,
wildness, and lawlessness of human
nature. Let's move forward in time to
the 21st century where we start to see
the focus shift to environmental harm.
Eco horror is a new genre that explores
fractured relationships between humans
and the environment through terrifying
representations of the natural world.
You know, natural disasters, toxic
water, aggressive killer hippos, which
sidebar, people really aren't as scared
of hippos as they should be. They are
murderous. Take Argentine author
Samantha Schweblin's 2014 book The
Stansia de Rescat called Feverdream in
its English translation. In the novel, A
Mysterious Poison in the Water kills a
horse and then nearly kills a 5-year-old
boy named David. David survives, but
he's changed. Half his [music] spirit
has been replaced by something that
makes him talk like a grown-up and be
just creepy beyond belief. Then when
Nenah, a little girl on vacation, also
ingests [music] the poison, her mother
Amanda becomes desperate for answers.
And this story was inspired by real life
dangers. Like in the 1990s, people
living in the city of Itu Saio became
suspicious that there was a link between
pesticides and the high rates of cancer,
birth defects, miscarriages, and sick
kids in their community. [music] So a
group of mothers led a door-to-door
study, ultimately proving this [music]
link. But while some pesticides have
been banned in Latin America for their
links to health issues, others remain
widely used despite scientists debating
their safety. Now compare that realworld
context to the title of the book. In
Spanish, the stansia de rescate
translates to rescue distance. That's
what Amanda calls the variable distance
separating me from my daughter. The
implied question is this. If Amanda
needs to rescue her daughter right now,
can she? How can she protect her child
from threats she can't even see? In an
interview, Schweblin described the power
of eco horror. Fear is what makes you
drop a book and run to your computer to
Google what is happening and think, ""Can
this happen to me? Is this really
happening?"" Of course, eco horror isn't
the only way contemporary Latin American
writers are engaging with environmental
damage and exploitation. A new crop of
eco poets are highlighting the modern
threats of resource extraction,
environmental violence, and climate
crisis. And they're doing it all in
verse. Take the Mapuche poet Ilikura
Chiaf, the first indigenous recipient of
Chile's National Prize for Literature.
He describes how in the Mapuche view,
everything in nature has a spirit and is
part of a greater infinite. And he often
explores this aliveness and
interconnectedness in his work. For
example, his poem
takes on a cyclical structure where each
element of the natural world, water,
air, earth, fire is dependent on
another. They tell me water is life. But
what does water do without the air? In
question after question, it's clear. You
really can't talk about the importance
of water without talking about
everything else. Because Bacham Mama,
she's got her hands in everything.
Chihuahua presents a hopeful alternative
to eco horror where materialism and
environmental degradation are left
behind in favor of a more indigenous
view of harmony with the earth. Nature
has been a source of inspiration for
Latin American writers for centuries.
And whether they've shown mama nature as
a source of wonder, terror, turmoil, or
transcendence, those representations
often reflect not just the landscape,
but the social and political times, too.
In our next episode, we'll explore how
Latin American literature has drawn
inspiration from another source of
turmoil, tyrants and dictators. Until
then, go show Patchamama some love.

7L2cSifRrLk,"How can native people reclaim their
stolen land? In 2020, [music]
members of the Honosonyi Confederacy,
also known as the Six Nations, occupied
an area of land in Calonia, Ontario.
They dug [music] trenches, erected
concrete barriers, and even blocked a
railroad and a highway. The nations were
protesting a planned [music] housing
development on land they argued was
stolen. So, they parked the bus,
literally, [music] and renamed the area
1492 Lambag Lane.
But did it work? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and
welcome to Crash Course Native American
History.
Landback. It shows up on t-shirts,
billboards, flags, and street art across
Indian country. But what does it
actually mean? Is it a political
movement, a philosophy, a form of
protest? Well, it's sort of all of the
above. Basically, landback describes any
effort by native people to reclaim
authority over stolen land and
resources. It's a way of asserting
tribal sovereignty that inherent right
to self-governance. Sometimes landback
means suing the government to honor
treaties. Other times it means erecting
a barricade to keep land developers out.
But more on that story in a bit. The
landback movement exists because a lot
has happened to native land over the
past few centuries. It was stolen in a
number of ways. through the legal
system, broken treaties, and often
outright violence. If you want to know
more, you can watch
basically every episode in this series.
In recent years, some private citizens
and public figures have tried to call
attention to this point through land
acknowledgements, where a person or
institution publicly states the land
they're on was stolen from natives. And
while a land acknowledgement can be a
good-natured gesture, some natives say
it's a hollow one, a way of saying sorry
without really doing anything to make
amends. In the words of Aphabaskan
writer Cena Crowe, indigenous
communities need resources, not
apologies. Word, Cena. But how landback
actually works can vary pretty widely.
Like today, some of the land in question
is privately owned, but much of it is
managed by federal or state governments.
In the privatelyowned cases, non-native
owners have occasionally offered up the
land voluntarily, either through a
direct return of the land or by paying
tribes a voluntary land tax, sometimes
called settler rent. Settler rent is a
way for non-native people to transfer
wealth back to the people whose land
they occupy, just like anyone would pay
rent to live on someone else's property.
But while Landback is about reclaiming
land, organizers explain that the last
thing they want to do is repeat the
mistakes of colonization by kicking
people out of their homes. Like in 2015
when the Pomo tribe bought back 700
acres on the California coast, [music]
the seller still lived on the land. So
the tribe signed a contract that allowed
him to keep living in his family home
until [music] his death, even though the
Pomo became the technical owners of that
land. However, much of the land that
native people seek to reclaim isn't
owned by individuals. It's owned by
federal or state governments, which
means that landback often happens
through the legal system. Sometimes
native nations are able to regain
complete control over their land in this
way. Other times they agree to share
control with the government. That's what
happened in 2012 when the Hez PBLO tribe
sued the United States over access to
the Bayas Calera National Preserve
[music] in what's now New Mexico. The
tribe argued it had never given up its
right to the land there, even though it
had been owned by the US since the
government bought it from a private
[music] owner in 2000. It took 12 years,
but in 2024, the two sides reached a
settlement. The government agreed to set
aside over 3,000 acres within the
preserve for the PBLO. And the PBLO
agreed to let the US Park Service
maintain the land for public use. A
win-win. The PBLO could now return to
their ancestral [music] home. But the
tribe got more than just land in the
settlement. They want a chance to
revitalize their culture. The governor
of the Himes PBLO, Peter Matalina,
[music]
said that the settlement was crucial to
the survival of the trib's traditions.
Returning the land to the PBLO gave them
the freedom to practice songs [music]
and dances tied to that land, which had
been part of their culture since well
before the US existed. [music] And
that's the thing about Lambach. It's not
just about the land itself. It's also
about reclaiming everything connected to
the land, reviving tribal relationships
and identity, making space for
traditional indigenous world [music]
views. And this is especially relevant
when it comes to the environment. As
we've learned in previous episodes,
natives often see the environment as
both a gift and a responsibility. We
take care of the land and the land takes
care of us. So for many natives,
widespread pollution and environmental
degradation can be traced back to the
same problem, colonization. when
settlers separated the land from the
native people who took care of it. Let
me give you an example. For centuries,
native Hawaiians had a diverse,
self-sufficient food system. On the
island of Malayi, native made fish
lagoons once fed about a million people.
But after Hawaii became a US territory
in the late 19th century, millions of
acres of land were stolen, and sellers
turned much of it into sugarcane [music]
and pineapple plantations, destroying or
abandoning the fish lagoons in the
process.
Fast forward to today and you'll find
over 80% of Hawaii's food gets imported
from elsewhere. And this lack [music] of
self-sufficiency in their food system is
dangerous. Because if an emergency
affected the availability of imports,
residents [music]
might not have enough to eat. So settles
of native culture by changing the
environment. They put everyone at risk.
For many natives, this complex dilemma
has one solution. Landback. At its core,
the Lambback movement is about
decolonization or undoing the ideas and
systems imposed by colonization. Like
the ones that decided only sugarcane and
pineapple should be grown at the expense
of a sustainable food system.
Decolonization means understanding that
the way things are isn't the way they
have to be. Just ask the native
activists who are currently working to
bring Hawaii's native fish lagoons back.
[music] A nonprofit group called Inan
Mimona or Fertile Land is leading a
community effort to restore the land and
teach a new generation of Native
Hawaiians [music]
sustainable fishing techniques and
traditional food practices. And when
native folks get land back, it could
have wide ranging, even global benefits.
In fact, some experts say if we were to
increase the forest land maintained by
indigenous peoples globally by about 900
million acres in the next [music] 25
years, it would be as impactful as
bringing every truck on the road up to
modern environmental admission
standards. That's a win [music] for all
of us. Unfortunately, one of the biggest
obstacles the landback movement faces is
a slow, tedious legal system. One that
was never designed to give land back,
only take it away. As we saw with the
James PBLO, it can take tribes years to
see any kind of justice. So sometimes
when those systems fail, native people
choose to take matters into their own
hands. Which brings me back to the fight
for 1492 landback lane. The Honosy
struggle didn't begin with trenches and
barricades. [music] Before that summer,
battles had been fought in the Canadian
Parliament and Court system and through
federal land claim processes. [music]
The honesty point back to the Haldderman
proclamation signed in 1784 by the
governor of Quebec that promised them
nearly 950,000 acres. [music]
It was a sign of goodwill after the
honied
with the British during the American
Revolution lost millions of acres in
what's now New York [music] State. But
it wasn't long after the proclamation
was made that European settlers began
moving [music] in on their promised
territory, pushing natives out. Dr. Rick
Monour, a Hundon historian, told
reporters, ""We took it to the court
system. We race it to every politician
that would listen for the last 200 years
or more, but no one ever does anything.""
I feel you, Rick. So, with the systems
failing them left and right, the Honjour
had finally had enough. After the
announcement of a massive new housing
addition that would develop the last of
the open land in the area, protesters
calling themselves [music] land
offenders moved in and set up an
encampment. At first, things were
peaceful. There were traditional dances,
songs, [music]
and food. But within a few weeks, the
police raided the encampment and
arrested several of the land offenders.
In response, the defenders dug in,
setting up a blockade and letting the
government know they had no plans to
leave willingly. The traditions
remained, but now [music] they existed
alongside burning tire fires and
graffitied buses. And it worked. Sort
of. A year later, the land developers
announced the cancellation of the
planned housing complex. But as of 2024,
over 1,400 days after the start of the
protest, there had been no resolution
between the nations and the government.
The Huny were still fighting for their
rights to the land more broadly. So the
occupation continued with a half dozen
members now living full-time on the
property. That's commitment. As
representatives from the occupation told
the government, ""We will continue to
cultivate orchards, sing our songs, and
hold space here. We will be free on our
land for however long it takes Canada to
realize we are never going to leave and
for generations after that."" This is
just one example of landback activism.
[music]
But across North America, advocates are
working every day to undo centuries of
injustice, broken treaties, [music] and
land theft, both in the courts and on
the ground. So landback is a big idea.
It's about getting native people back
[music] to the land, nursing the land
back to health, and bringing back our
understanding of land as essential to
human life. [music] This can mean long,
hard-fought court cases, and it could
also mean direct activism and protest,
and it continues to this day. In our
next episode, we're going to shift gears
and talk about the ways that native
culture has been appropriated in the
media, and I will see you then. Thanks

oyv-eJRRozs,"What can a story tell us about Latin
American history? What about a poem, an
essay, or a whole novel? All the stuff
we think of as literature isn't just art
or entertainment. It's got a lot more to
say. And I don't know about you, but I'm
ready to hear the cheese. Hi, I'm Curly
Velasquez, and this is Crash Course
Latin American Literature.
[music]
We've learned earlier in this series
that the term Latin America wasn't in
use until the 19th century around the
time when the region's nations gained
independence from Spain and Portugal. So
when did Latin American literature
start? I mean a lot of life and culture
happened during the pre-colonial era
before Christopher Columbus showed up
completely uninvited by the way. For
starters, indigenous communities like
the Kichche or Mayan people of Guatemala
had a rich tradition of oral literature.
Stories were a super important part of
understanding their own culture and
history, including their origins.
Through oral storytelling, they passed
down stories of Kiche creation. Many
involving two characters known as the
hero twins, Kunapu [music]
and Spalangqu. Like in one story, the
hero twins go to the underworld to
avenge their father by playing a ball
game awfully similar to soccer. Oh, I
mean football. Anyway, together these
stories are known as a pulvu. And if
you're thinking, ""Curly, that oral
literature looks a lot like a book.""
You're not wrong. Sometime in the 1550s
while under Spanish colonial rule, a
kiche author or maybe a group of
authors, not all writers work in
tortured solitude [laughter and gasps]
used the Latin alphabet to record the
popu as a book which transformed it from
oral literature to, you know, literary
literature. Then in the 18th century, a
Dominican frier, no not that kind of
Dominican, the one with the hair thing.
Yes. Yes. named Francisco Gimenez
translated the Pulbu from Kiche into
Spanish, which is the version that we
have now. It's one of only 14 surviving
indigenous manuscripts from all of Latin
America, which underscores the immense
cultural loss that came with colonialism
in this region. Just imagine what we're
missing. But the Populu lives on,
providing crucial insight about Latin
American literature, both historically
and now. So many of its themes appear in
stories written centuries later, like
the relationship between humans and
nature, the importance of familial
ancestors and animals acting as
semi-agical spirit guides. We'll see
these come up again and again in our
series, too. Colonization in Latin
America dragged on for over 300 years,
but by the early 19th century, we start
to see a major shift. Independence
movements were springing up all across
the continent. And as Latin Americans
strive for political autonomy,
literature reflected that. It gave voice
to desires for independence and cultural
self- definitionf. Take the 1823 poem
Aloon La Poia, a location to poetry
written by the Venezuelanborn poet
Andres Beo while he was in exile in
London. Beo addresses the poem like a
letter written to divine poetry that
lets us know he's talking about culture.
and not sending a secret admirer note to
yours truly. In the second stanza, Beao
invites poetry to return to Latin
America. It is time for you to leave
Afitit Europe, no lover of your native
rustic charms and fly to where
Columbus's world opens its great scene
before he rise. Now, if you're like,
""Excuse me, Columbus's world?"" That's
what I thought, too. But what he's
signaling with that phrase is not a
return to the original indigenous Latin
America. That world has been forever
changed. So it has to become something
new. But he's also not accepting a
European view of the quote new world. He
wants Latin Americans to shift their
eyes to the great scene that is Latin
America today. One independent from that
stage five clinger European influence.
As the poem goes on, Bealeo situates
poetry as the soul of his people, using
the genre as a standin for the whole
region, seeking freedom and its own
cultural identity. Beo was also a
grimarian and a politician because even
in the 1800s, poets needed side gigs.
It's a tough life out here. He created a
Spanish grammar that helped new nations
make the language their own. And he held
political positions in Venezuela,
Colombia, and Chile as they established
their own independent nation states. And
I mean, when your poets are politicians
and your politicians are poets, there's
no separating literature from political
history. But poetry wasn't the only kind
of literature that popped off during
this period of revolution. Essays,
academic works, and letters played a
huge role, too. Take Beo's good friend,
Simon Bolivar. He was a politician,
statesman, and a revolutionary leader.
He's best known for helping the colonial
territory Viseroy of New Granada win
independence and establish the countries
of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and
Venezuela. One of Bolivar's most famous
literary works is Garta de Hamika,
Jamaica letter written in 1815. While
Bolivad was in exile in Jamaica, it
expresses his hope and determination for
a free Latin America. But Wolivad also
expresses the unique challenges of
forming new national identities after
centuries of colonization. Writing, we
are neither Indians nor Europeans. Yet
we are a part of each. To be clear, he
means indigenous folks, not people from
India. Classic Colombian era stuff. So
he's saying like, who are we? We no
longer have the culture of indigenous
peoples because we've been influenced by
centuries of European colonization.
But we haven't become European either.
We're still our own thing. For the
critic Roberto Gonzalez Echavaria,
Bolivar's conundrum is the starting
point of most modern Latin American
literature. How do you balance a
European mindset with regional history
and culture? And how do you pin all of
that down in a work of literature or in
your own identity for that matter? Over
the following centuries, as Latin
American writers worked through these
questions and discovered their own
unique voices and cultural identities,
people outside the region began to
discover that Latin American secret
sauce, too. And I'm not talking
habanero. By the time the 1960s rolled
around, the Latin American boom had
begun. A literary movement that saw
Latin American writers achieve
unprecedented international success. The
nova nolla new novel was the most
popular literary form during this time
and boom era novelists turned to
centuries of Latin American history and
literary tradition for inspiration all
the way back to the football move and
like the poetry of the independence
movement boom novels tended to be pretty
political. All those years of
colonization and revolution inspired
these writers as did more recent
political movements like the Cuban
revolution of the 1950s and the
dictatorships in Argentina, Peru, Chile,
Brazil, and Paraguay. But this type of
political and cultural upheaval wasn't
limited to Latin America. In the 1960s,
the world was changing everywhere. There
were dozens of independence movements
across Africa. the Berlin Wall was going
up and the civil rights movement had
begun in the US just to name a few
examples. So these political themes
resonated with international readers.
But what really made the boom novel
famous was the introduction of magical
realism, a literary genre that blends
magical elements with reality. What's so
unique about magical realism is that in
the world of the novel, those magical
elements aren't perceived as being
magical. like a levitating priest,
casual, a flying carpet, whatever. A
5-year rainstorm, no biggie. All
extraordinary moments presented as
ordinary. And no, I didn't just make up
those examples myself. I'm good, but I'm
not that good. The credits due to
Gabrielle Garcia Marquez, born in
Colombia on March 6th, 1927. Garcia
Marquez authored more than 24 books
including his 1967 masterpiece
dea 100 years of solitude which sounds
like a dream. Leave me with a good book
and a snack and I'm there. Oh. Oh my
god. How'd you know? Let's get into the
curly notes. Set in the fictional town
of Makondo, 100 Years of Solitude tells
the story of the Wendy family over the
course of seven generations. That's a
lot of abas. And the setting is so
important. [music] We see that in the
beginning, Mount Mondo is isolated from
the outside world. The village is made
of just 20 adobe houses along a river
lined with stones that look like
prehistoric eggs. Garcia Marquez writes,
""The world was so recent that many
things lacked names, and in order to
indicate them, [music] it was necessary
to point.
Not at me, rude. But over time, new
technologies, political unrest, [music]
and foreign businesses start reshaping
the village. Many of them real
historical events, like Colombia's war
of a thousand days. By blending myth and
reality, Garcia Marquez uses Mondo as a
standin for all of Latin America,
[music] creating an intimate setting to
discuss a whole region's complicated
politics. Beyond Makondo, what's most
memorable for many of us is Garcia
Marquez's use of magical realism,
including a rain of yellow flowers after
the family's patriarch dies. They fell
on the town all through the night in a
silent storm, [music] and they covered
the roofs and blocked the doors and
smothered the animals who slept
outdoors. [music]
So many flowers fell from the sky that
in the morning the streets were carpeted
with a compact cushion and they had to
clear them away with [music] shovels and
rakes so the funeral procession could
pass by. This scene is so beloved that
when Garcia Marquez passed away in 2014,
people paid homage to him with memorials
filled with yellow flower petals. Of
course, Garcia Marquez is just one
master of magical realism. Can we save
that for later? Thank you so much. Boom
writers like Julio Gartasar, Elan Agaro,
Carlos Fuentes, Maria Louisa Bombal, and
Mario Vargas Yossa have also woven
fantastical threads into realistic
stories, a tradition that traces all the
way back to pre-colonial times. Now, for
the global literary community, magical
realism came to overdefine Latin
American literature, reducing its
diversity to just one thing. This is why
we can't have nice things global
literary community, but we'll talk more
about that in a later episode. Our
history is a part of us. It informs
everything that we do, think, and
create. And the same goes for the
literature of Latin America. The region
has a long and complex history littered
with political strife and the struggle
for identity, but also regional pride
and football. That history is reflected
in the novels, poems, letters, and
essays of the people who helped to shape
it. Next time we're heading to La
Hungla, the jungle to explore what
nature can teach us about humanity. See
you then. Thanks for watching this

excited about language? For the Nubio
people, one answer is a video game. In
2014, the Cook Inlet Tribal Council
helped create Kima Initi or Never Alone.
Players take on the role of a young
Inupia girl named Nuna as she solves
puzzles with her Arctic Fox and the
whole game is narrated in Inupia. But
why don't these kids already know the
language of their ancestors? I'm Shay
Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native
American History.
Language is the foundation of culture
and for native folks it's how we
preserve our oral histories, maintain
our laws, pass down knowledge of the
natural world and so much more. As Da
Elder Paul Dain said, our language and
culture is the window through which we
see the world. To lose it is to lose
part of ourselves. But sadly, fluency
rates for Native American languages have
been declining for hundreds of years.
Today, many of those languages are in
danger of disappearing altogether. Some
scholars predict that over 90% of all
Native American languages could
disappear by 2050 with no fluent
speakers left to carry them forward.
We're going to talk a lot more about why
this is happening and what's being done
to prevent it a little bit later. But
things haven't always been this dire
depending on which scholars you ask.
Prior to the 15th century, there were
anywhere between 300 to 2,000 distinct
native languages spoken across the
continent. Imagine it. Just a few
hundred years ago, right here in what's
now Indianapolis, you could have heard
dozens of different indigenous
languages. It might have been hard to
get directions, though. We can learn a
lot about tribal cultures from their
languages. Not just from what's said out
loud, but also from what's between the
lines. Like, think about this. Our
language reveals something about things
we value. Maybe that's why in English
everything's such a big hit or a home
run. Unless, of course, you drop the
ball. Oh, well, you win some, you lose
some. We get it. You like sports. Native
languages do this, too. The tribe's
worldview is often baked into the
language itself. Many languages have
certain types of nouns and verbs for
gender that show its importance in the
culture's worldview. Like in Anesnab
Moen spoken by the Ojiway Odawa and
Padawatami peoples, there are special
classes for nouns and verbs for both
living and non-living objects which
underscores the cultural idea of kinship
or family relations among people,
animals, and non-living elements.
Podawatami writer and botnist Robin Wall
Kimmeer breaks it down like this. Of an
inanimate being like a table, we say
what is it? And we answer dopini. table
it is. But of an apple we must say who
is that being and reply mashim mean
Yahweh apple that being is? Or in my
tribe the Navajo or D we use the word to
refer to a sense of harmony in different
situations. Like if someone asks you
or how are you you might respond meaning
it's good. But we also use it when
concluding a prayer. we say
four times in a row to mean all is at
peace again. So even though there's no
direct English translation for hjo, you
can still get the idea that it
represents a state of balance and
harmony. The point is to understand
cultural ideas, it helps to understand
the languages they were originally
communicated through. Otherwise, things
get lost in translation. And not just
languages, but ideas and cultures. And
for nearly all native speakers in the
US, the window to save them is closing.
So what happened? Why are native
languages in danger? Well, as with so
many other aspects of Native American
life, these languages were drastically
altered with the arrival of European
colonizers in the 15th century. For
hundreds of years, those colonists and
later the US government committed what's
called linguisticide, the deliberate
killing of language as part of a broader
effort to erase native culture. The
attempt to absorb a minority culture
into the dominant culture is called
assimilation. But there was one
assimilation policy in particular that
had an outsized impact on native
languages. Federal Indian boarding
schools. Now, just a heads up, what I'm
about to cover is difficult to hear, so
please take care as you watch on.
Between the late 19th and early 20th
centuries, thousands of native childrens
were forcefully separated from their
parents and enrolled into boarding
[music] schools modeled after a prisoner
of war camps. When the students [music]
arrived, administrators took their
clothes, cut their hair, and bathe them
in kerosene to cleanse them and prevent
the spread of

>> illness and lice.
The children were given English names
and forbidden from speaking [music]
their native languages. If a student
spoke just a single word of Indian,
[music]
they were punished, which could include
whippings, solitary confinement,
starvation, and even withholding medical
treatment. Bill Wright, [music]
a Pawan Indian elder, spoke out about
the abuse he and other native children
suffered in these schools. In an
interview with NPR, Rice said [music]
that he lost his culture, his language,
and even his name, telling reporters,
quote, ""I remember coming home and my
grandma asked me to talk Indian to her,
and I said, ""Grandma, I don't understand
you."" And when she called him by his
Indian name, Tarum, he told her his name
was Billy. And if it feels like these
schools are a part of a long ago past,
[music]
Wright passed away in 2021.
In fact, there are still boarding school
survivors alive today fighting for
recognition, justice, and healing.
By 1900, 20,000 Indian children were in
boarding schools. That number jumped up
to more than 60,000 just 25 years later.
And by 1926, nearly 83% of Indian school
age children were attending boarding
schools. It wasn't until 1972 when
Congress passed the Indian Education
Act, thanks in part to pressure from
native groups, that control of the
schools passed to tribal authorities.
But by then, the damage had been done. A
2024 federal report found that at least
973 children died at these schools.
while acknowledging that the true total
is likely much higher. And many
thousands of children left these schools
having lost all connection to their
traditional languages. Those who did
remember them now associate those
languages with deep lasting trauma. Many
former students chose not to pass their
language on to their children and
grandchildren in order to spare them
from that same pain. This generational
loss has rippled across communities. In
places like Alaska, language loss has
been linked to higher rates of poverty,
substance abuse, and suicide. In 2018,
the governor of Alaska declared a
linguistics emergency in the state,
recognizing the loss and potential
extinction of the official 20 Alaskan
native languages, which brings me back
to the new pat and their attempt to
revive their language. Unlike other
video games, Never Alone doesn't reward
players with trophies or points, but
rather traditional stories from Alaskan
native culture. At the same time,
important aspects of that culture are
built into the gameplay, like the hero
Nuna often relies on spirits to help
guide her on her journey. Since its
release, a classroom guide has been
created and distributed along with
copies of the game to every school
district in Alaska. Elsewhere, native
folks are incorporating their languages
into music. Like Wade Fernandez, a
singer songwriter from the Monomony
nation, his song Sua Mia, or we are
blessed combines contemporary melodies
with his traditional Monomin language.
[singing and music]
>> Plus, it's a total banger. In places
like Hawaii and Arizona, native language
immersion schools encourage students to
wear traditional clothing, speak their
languages, and engage with their
cultures. A complete 180 from the
boarding school era. Studies have shown
that native students in immersion
schools have better test scores, [music]
stronger cultural connections, and
higher rates of graduation compared to
native students in public schools. The
programs have been so successful in
Hawaii that language programs have
expanded [music] to the college level.
Students there can now attend university
courses taught entirely in Native
Hawaiian. [music] And it's having a big
impact. In the early 1980s, fewer than
50 people below the age of 18 could
speak fluent Native Hawaiian. Thanks to
immersion schools and revisation
efforts, over 18,000 people now speak
Hawaiian statewide. And a language that
students were once punished for speaking
is now protected by law. These efforts
are even working their way into broader
culture. Like the original Star Wars
film was dubbed in Navajo in 2012. And
in 2022, the movie Prey became the first
film to fully be dubbed in the Comanche
language. Can every movie be like this?
Dorothy Labaueti Shakuan elder once
said, quote, ""Losing the language means
losing the culture. We need to know who
we are because it makes a difference in
who our children are.""
Before Europeans arrived, North America
was full of diverse languages that
carried not just [music] meaning, but
history, culture, and entire ways of
knowing. Thankfully, revitalization
efforts are making headway today to
preserve what might have otherwise been
lost forever. [music] Next time, we'll
explore the landback movement, and I
will see you then. Thanks for watching

hX6lzkQBmhc,"Where is Latin America? Well, just like
the question, who's the most iconic
Spice Girl? The answer depends on who
you ask. Some people say Latin America
is anywhere south of the US. Others say
it's anywhere south of the US where
romance languages are commonly spoken.
So, we're talking about anywhere from 20
to 52 countries and territories where
hundreds of languages are spoken across
millions of square miles. As I scrolled
through these debates in a few scholarly
toms and read it, I couldn't help but
wonder why lump so many distinct
countries into one identity. What makes
a Latin American Latin American? Hi, I'm
Kurly Velasquez and this is Crash Course
Latin American literature. [music]
Do we have to agree on what Latin
America is before talking about Latin
American literature?
How much time do you have? It turns out
the Latin American label is surprisingly
new. Some historians say the term began
with the French in the 1830s. In an
attempt to seize power over Mexico,
Napoleon the third, no, not not that
Napoleon,
the one with the bigote. Yes. Yes.
wanted to emphasize that both France and
Mexico shared Latin roots in their
languages, hence Latin America. This was
an example of imperialism where one
country takes power over another and
it's a critical part of Latin American
history. But so is resistance to
imperialism. Others credit the name
Latin America to Chilean politician
Francisco Vilvao who called for dozens
of countries to unite under this shared
identity and the fight against global
imperial powers. Today there's
disagreement about why the term has
stuck around too. Is Latin America still
in use because outsiders flatten other
cultures into falsely uniform
identities? Or because people from the
region feel a shared sense of community
despite national differences? In this
series, we'll use Latin America to mean
countries with the shared history of
colonization by Spain and Portugal,
followed by independence. But to get a
bigger picture, we'll also explore
indigenous literature and Latin American
authors in the US who write in English.
One thing you'll learn about me is I
don't do anything small. And all these
questions about what unites and divides
a region, about where its boundaries
fall, about who we are in relationship
to each other, they're not simply
hurdles we have to clear. They're some
of the central questions at the heart of
so much of Latin American literature.
Now, because Latin Americans are
diverse, it's challenging to choose one
label to describe us. Like in the US,
you may hear the terms Latino or Latina
to refer to immigrants from Latin
America and their descendants or
genderneutral alternatives like Latinex
or Latina. You guys, it is one letter
change. We will all survive. I promise.
Meanwhile, the term Hispanic refers to
people of Spanish-sp speakaking descent
or origin. So, someone from Spain would
be Hispanic but not Latino. And a
Portuguese-speaking Brazilian might
consider themselves Latino but not
Hispanic. And there are a lot of other
community specific terms out there like
cho for people of Mexican descent living
in the US or Afro Latino for those in
Latin America with African ancestry or
even New Rican for Puerto Ricans living
in New York. So yeah, Latin America
includes lots of different communities
across lots of different countries and
languages, which means in literature we
find lots of different answers to the
question, who are we? Some Latin
American authors like Mexican Canadian
writer Sylvia Moreno Garcia write mostly
in English. Others write both in Spanish
and English. and some flip between
languages even within the same text like
Los Rios Profundos deep rivers by Jose
Maria Argedas uses both Spanish and the
indigenous language Ketwa. Sometimes
you'll find Spanglish a mixture of
Spanish and English like in Sandra
Cisneros's The House on Mango Street.
You'll also find Portuno, a blend of
Portuguese and Spanish like in Fabian
Seo's novel No,
Nights in the North. And language plays
a big role in the international
availability of Latin American
literature too. Well, language, power,
and you know, capitalism. Like, US
publishers have been more interested in
books from Argentina and Mexico for at
least the last decade. So, these are the
books that tend to get translated into
English, and that influences what can
make its way into English language
classes and crash courses. In this
series, we'll span diverse genres and
take a broad view of what literature
means or literature if you're Oprah.
We'll cover the usual suspects, poetry,
novels, and short stories, but also dive
into historical accounts, political
essays, and other texts. Do my ex's text
messages count too or not so much? Oh,
you're saying no. Okay. often will
encounter authors with ties to multiple
countries like Gladis Leeto was born in
Ukraine but spent much of her life in
Brazil and the Cuban writer Jose Marti
wrote for an Argentine newspaper while
in exile in New York. So, it's no
surprise that Latin American literature
often wrestles with big questions about
identity, like what's our relationship
to Europe and the rest of the world for
that matter after being colonized and
gaining independence? And what's our
relationship to our indigenous ancestors
and our African ancestors, too? Given
the blend of indigenous, African, and
European influences, who even are we?
Anyone? Anyone?
Okay, how about we hash this out with
Mexican writer Octavio Bas. Here are the
curly notes on P's 1950 essay loss de la
Maline the sons of Maline.
Maline wasn't your average senora. She
was a multilingual indigenous woman who
after being enslaved and handed over to
the Spanish as a teenager interpreted
for Ednan Cortez during [music] his
conquest of Dino Titlan in 1521. She and
Cortez also had a son who's seen as one
of the first mystisos, meaning people of
mixed indigenous [music] and Spanish
ancestry, which describes most of
Mexico's population today. Bas writes
that Maline is often remembered as a
traitor who gave herself voluntarily to
the concistador and that the Mexican
people have not forgiven La Maline for
her betrayal. He points out that the
word Malineista became a popular insult
to quote denounce all those who have
been corrupted by foreign influences. Am
I tripping or is Cortez the real villain
here? Bas argues that the reason
Mexicans condemn Malinee is [music] to
try to distance themselves from a
painful part of their past and
transcended. The Mexican does not want
to be either an Indian or a Spaniard,
nor does he want to be descended from
them. He denies them and he does not
affirm himself as a mixture but rather
[music] as an abstraction. His
beginnings are in his own self. I'm
going to need some gapito to process
this one.
Much better. When your national identity
is a mix of cultures and has been shaped
by violent colonization, how do you
begin to answer a question like who are
we? How far back should we go for
answers? and how close to home should we
stay? Another Mexican writer, Carlos
Fuentes, explores those questions in his
1975 novel, Deer Nostra. Rather than
analyze a single historical figure like
Maline, Fuentes prowls for answers
across history, zooming between ancient
Rome, pre-colonial Mexico, 16th century
Spain, and 1999 Paris. But Fuentes
doesn't stop there. He links Spain's
colonization of the Americas to a much
bigger story. A New York Times review
described Terran Nostra as a panoramic
espano American creation myth and the
scholar Lucille Kerr says that it
explores Mexican identity in terms of
universal myth and history. In the world
of Theronostra, the mystery of Mexican
identity is the same mystery of
civilization on which civilization
itself is founded. Meaning like we're
all products of violent histories of
borders that shifted over time. All of
civilization is a story of different
peoples clashing and melding and
becoming something new. In this way, the
Latin American story or stories really
shed light on all of our stories. Much
of the Anostra focuses on a
fictionalized account of the real life
Spanish king Felipe II, who was a true
Nepo baby. He inherited his entire
kingdom from his dad. Must be nice. All
I got from my dad was a used Honda.
Filipe obsessively constructed a massive
palace/moselum
called the escoreal and Fuentes portrays
it in a real the emperor has no clothes
kind of way. Even though Spain colonized
and held power in the Americas for
centuries, Filipe's single-minded focus
on what amounts to an extremely
elaborate coffin reflects the emptiness
of the whole colonial project as based
on death on Nada. And Fuentes wasn't the
only writer to explore Latin American
identity by thinking globally. Before
him in Argentina, Jorge Luis Boures
wrestled with these issues in his work.
He was of Spanish, Portuguese, and
English descent, educated in
Switzerland, and traveled off into
Europe. His whole life and work was at
the crossroads of these identity
intersections. And in his 1951 essay, El
escentino
tradition, the Argentine writer and
tradition, Boures encourages others to
work at these crossroads, too. He
resists the idea that to be an Argentine
writer means only dabbling in your own
backyard. We must believe that the
universe is our birthright and try out
every subject. Besus is capturing a
tension between the local and the global
that can be found in a lot of Latin
American literature in communities
living with the legacy of colonization.
You can't start asking a question like
who are we without searching the world
for answers. So what do you do with
that? The Brazilian writer Oswald
Deandra suggests cannibalism,
cultural cannibalism that is. He does it
himself in his 1928 essay manifesto
anthropoago.
cannibalist manifesto with this line.
Dupy or not dupee? That is the question.
Sound familiar? He's reappropriating
Shakespeare's famous line from Hamlet
using the similar sounding name of an
indigenous people in Brazil. Like why
not devour and Brazilify one of the most
famous lines in English literature?
Andraj calls for Brazilians to do the
same. Take in the influences, blend them
up, and pour them out as something
totally new. Oh, thank you. It's my
postc colonial protein smoothie.
I think it needs some work. In a vastly
diverse region, you're not going to find
one single answer to the question, who
are we? Latin American literature is
produced across many different
communities in many different languages
from a blend of influences. And when
Latin American writers explore identity,
they're often navigating the tension
between influences from their own
neighborhood and the other side of the
world. To which I say, no loss. Why not
both? Next time we'll talk about how
stories, history, and politics collide.

In 13 episodes, we'll explore the
trends, tropes, and movements of a super
diverse region. Considering everything
from pre-colonial indigenous texts to
contemporary novels, and spoiler alert,
it isn't all magical realism. Now,
before you go, eh, Curly, I'm not really

isn't just a school thing. My book club
is about the cheese, the gossip, love,

I'm saying is books can be juicy, and
there's something for everybody in Latin
American literature. Romance, action,
family drama, mysteries, politics, and
my favorite, ghosts. Literature is one
of the most direct portals we've got to
other people's lives. It helps us better
understand each other, the past, and
even the time we live in now. And we can
look at literature through different
lenses. What does this novel tell us
about identity, family, memory, even
ourselves? And listen, we're not here to
serve up everything you need to write a
five-page essay. Think of this series
more like a shakuerie board. A bite of

xtwJfk94CP8,"In 2024, Native Nations in South Dakota
were beefing hard with the state's
governor, Christy No. She had removed
Native American history from state
teaching standards, called Native kids
hopeless, and claimed tribal leaders
were working with drug cartels. Enough
was enough. It was time to take action.
All nine native nations in the state
decided to kick her out, banning the
governor from setting foot on their
tribal land. But wait, wait, wait. Can
tribal governments actually do that? Hi,
I'm Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.
[Music]
Tribal governments are the governing
bodies of federally recognized tribes,
each separate and distinct in its own
right. And yeah, they can keep people
from entering their lands, even if they
happen to be a state governor. This is
just one example of how tribal
governments can sometimes conflict with
federal and state ones. But bans aren't
the only way they exercise their power.
Far from it. Today, we're going to talk
about how tribal governments operate and
the delicate tight ropes they walk. But
before we dive into the nitty-gritty
politics of it all, let's start with
some basics. Native nations have always
had an inherent right to self-govern
known as sovereignty, which you can
learn a lot more about in episode two.
And because of that sovereignty, tribal
governments have a totally unique
relationship to the US governments where
they're subject to certain federal laws,
yet make their own laws on their own
land. This creates a push and pull that
pops up all the time. like it came up
around plans to build a pipeline near
the Standing Rock Stew reservation in
2016 and it comes up fairly often around
casinos built on Indian territory. The
way these issues are negotiated shows us
how the expression of sovereignty by
tribal governments changes over time.
We'll get more into each of these
examples in a moment, but first there's
another even broader kind of conflict, a
conflict of values about how government
should even work in the first place.
Let's turn back the clock to 1934 when
the New Deal reigned supreme and a stamp
only cost three cents. This was just a
few years after the US government had
formally acknowledged the awful
situation they'd put native nations in.
The average tribal member lived in
poverty. Generations of native kids had
been ripped from their families and sent
to abusive boarding schools. And tribes
had lost 90 million acres of land in
just 50 years as a direct result of
federal policies. Yikes. So, in an
attempt to fix all that damage, Congress
passed the Indian Reorganization Act,
aka the IRA. The goal was to reaffirm
the government's support of native
sovereignty. Love that for us. But
there's a catch. Policy makers didn't
think traditional native governments
were fit for the demands of modern life.
Traditionally, some tribal governments
ruled by consensus, where leaders would
hold community discussions about
everyone's concerns and move towards a
solution that blended all of their
perspectives. Everybody heard each other
out and cooperated to find a compromise.
This was and is a hugely important value
underlying how many tribal governments
work. But the US wanted tribal
governments to reflect their own and
withheld IRA funding until tribes gave
themselves a makeover. Specifically, the
federal government wanted them to move
to a system of majority rule where the
group chooses the option that gets the
most votes regardless of other people's
concerns. A lot of tribes weren't
thrilled about giving up their consensus
governments. In fact, 77 of them voted
to reject the plan, but 181 native
nations did reorganize under the IRA.
And today, there are two main ways those
tribal governments are set up. with a
modern structure or hybrid structure.
Let's start with the modern structure.
Typically, this means having an
organizing document like a constitution
approved by the secretary of the
interior. Usually, but not always,
there's an elected tribal council and
tribal chairperson, which operate as
legislative and executive branches,
respectively. Together, they can
negotiate on the trib's behalf with
federal, state, and local governments.
And many, but not all, have their own
court systems and their own tribal
police. You can see how this reflects
the US government with its three
separate branches creating checks and
balances. Members of the council and the
chairperson are elected democratically
by tribal members, the same as a
congressperson or the president would
be. Meanwhile, tribal laws are enacted
by a majority vote in the council,
similar to Congress, and enforced by
tribal courts, similar to the Supreme
Court. Yep. Yep. looks like a modern
American government. Then there's the
hybrid structure which blends older and
newer forms of tribal governments
together. This mixture can look
different from tribe to tribe. For
example, it can involve making decisions
both through elected officials and
through traditionally selected leaders
or it can involve incorporating
consensus in some parts of governance
but majority rule in others. Take the
prot tribe. They were among the 77 that
initially rejected the IRA. And though
they did eventually establish executive,
legislative, and judicial branches,
they've also held on to traditional
values of consensus through a general
council that includes every adult member
of the tribe. Anybody who's on the
council can independently propose
legislation. And for an initiative to
pass, at least twothirds of the council
needs to be on board with it. So, we've
got a handle on the various ways tribal
governments operate. But what does this
look like in practice? What do tribal
governments actually do? First and
foremost, they govern their own citizens
within their territories. They alone
call the shots on what it takes to be
one of those citizens. They control how
much of their land gets used. They
oversee their own schools, utilities,
roads, and communication networks. And
much like a local or state government,
tribes can issue business licenses and
collect sales tax within their borders.
But at the same time, the federal
government can restrict tribal
government's authority, drastically
affecting native people's lives. We
natives are currently in our
selfdetermination era. Basically, it
means the US government has agreed to
use its authority mostly to defend
tribal sovereignty and help repair the
damage of centuries past. And that means
tribes have more direct involvement in
the public services that are maintained
and delivered in Indian country. But
things aren't perfect. and tribal
agencies often have to navigate a maze
of bureaucracy to get the support that
they need. We're talking miles of red
tape. For example, the National Tribal
Broadband Grant helps link reservations
to high-speed internet, which is a big
deal. It makes it possible for tribal
citizens to do distance learning, work
remotely, have telealth appointments, or
I don't know, watch Crash Course. Just a
thought. But funding sources like this
are spread across seven different
federal agencies. So it could be hard
for tribal governments to even know they
exist, much less identify the funding
they qualify for. And when federal
agencies do make policies that affect
tribes, they're supposed to consult with
tribal governments first. They're
supposed to get input from the tribal
officials before imposing rules and
compensate tribal governments if it'll
be costly to comply with them. That's
what's supposed to happen. But this is
more of an ideal than a description of
how things always go. Take what happened
in 2016 with the construction of the
Dakota Access Pipeline. The corporation
building the pipeline planned for it to
cross beneath Lake Aah close enough to
contaminate the drinking water of the
Standing Rock Sue if an oil leak
happened. The US Army Corps of Engineers
had approved the plan without consulting
the tribe. Understandably, the Standing
Rock Sue weren't happy about this, so
the tribe sued and requested that all
the construction stop at once. The Sue
sued, but construction continued and the
tribe lost in court. The federal
government did ask the company building
the pipeline to pretty please of their
own choosing, leave a buffer of 20 m
around Lake Oah, but the company didn't
listen. The pipeline was built and
continues to operate today, but the
fight isn't over. The Standing Rock Sue
have continued to call for the pipeline
to be removed and the governments and
companies alike are discovering that
tribal governments are a force to be
reckoned with. Just ask Christy Gnome.
And it's not just Standing Rock. Many
other tribal governments are asserting
their sovereignty these days and
resisting efforts to restrict it when
necessary. After all, sovereignty is
like a muscle. The more you exercise it,
the stronger it gets. For example, some
tribes operate casinos or gaming
operations on their land as a way of
raising funds to run their governments,
which is allowed under federal law. The
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act says tribes
can enter into gaming compacts with
states. And if any state law conflicts
with federal law, the federal law is
supposed to apply. Paper beats rock. But
in 2019, the governor of Oklahoma, Kevin
Stitz, tried to block tribes from
renewing their gaming compacts
automatically, which arguably could have
ended those compacts altogether.
Multiple tribes sued, arguing that this
move violated federal law, and the
federal courts agreed because again,
paper beats rock. But asserting tribal
sovereignty is rarely that simple. And
as we saw with the Dakota Access
Pipeline, at times tribes have had to
challenge corporations and the federal
government, fighting a war on multiple
fronts. That's just a small slice of
what makes running a modern tribal
government such a unique challenge. Each
one faces very different problems than
it did five centuries ago. So they've
had to adapt and change while retaining
aspects of their identity as sovereign
independent nations. After all, we're
talking about nations within a larger
nation. things are bound to be complex.
In our next episode, we're going to talk
about the ways that Native nations are
working to preserve their traditional
languages and I will see you then.

Dj8EjBQJD84,"Native women have always had a sacred
and powerful role in our communities.
Not only as aunties, mamas and grandmas,
although those are some very important
jobs, too, but also as holy women,
healers, leaders, and across cultures
and languages. Native oral traditions
are brimming with some pretty divine
female figures, protectors of land and
sea, creation and destruction, life and
death. Hi, I'm Lily Gladstone
and this is Crash Course Native American
History.
[Music]
Well, before Europeans arrived in what
is now North America, native beliefs
around gender were and honestly still
are pretty diverse. In fact, many Native
American tribes are matriarchal, meaning
women hold significant power in our
communities, including as the uh primary
decision makers. Matriarchal tribes then
and now tend to value ideas such as
equality, consensus finding, giftgiving,
and peace building. For example, with
Navajo or D, mothers and grandmothers
serve as the matriarchs or the heads of
individual clans. While men usually are
leading intertribal meetings and making
decisions about war, women have the
final say when it comes to clan
disputes. They control their own land,
their own livestock, their own crafts,
and any money that they earn, they keep.
Da are also matrinal, meaning that
family heritage is passed through the
mother's line. This equality can be
found in Da spirituality too. Both men
and women are allowed to become medicine
people, traditional healers who perform
ceremonies for the sick. It's said that
Ashta Nadle or changing woman explained
it to the son, the father of her
children, like this. You are of sky, I
am of earth. Remember, as different as
we are, you and I, we are of one spirit.
We are of equal worth. And back in the
day, while Da women didn't join raids or
go to war, women in other tribes did.
Mine included. Her name was running
eagle Petan.
Among a lot of native nations, women
would often lead war parties and
participate in battles. How about
Buffalo Cathro woman of the northern
Cheyenne in what is now Montana? In the
late 1800s, she and her family were
camping near a creek when a group of
white soldiers attacked. When her
brother fell in the fight, she rode into
battle and rescued him. About a week
later, with her Colt 45, Buffalo Calfro
woman would fight in the battle of the
Little Bigghorn. And though we don't
know for sure, there are plenty of
stories from several tribal nations that
claim it was a woman who dealt Kuster
the final blow. Other Native women took
on the roles of leaders and diplomats in
times of conflict. In fact, one of the
strongest Native American confederacies,
the Hodnosi, was co-founded by a native
woman named Chukon Sensei. Let me tell
you her story.
Oh.
Way back before European arrival, there
were five waring nations. The Kauga, the
Mohawk, Onida, Onendaga, and Saka. Jon
sensei didn't want any part of that war.
But she lived along a war road, one that
warriors from every nation traveled. So
instead of shutting the door and turning
them away, she offered shelter and food
to anyone who came through. She even
helped resolve arguments between members
of different nations. Mhm. Meanwhile, a
man named Peacemaker was looking to end
the war and unify the five nations,
which makes sense, name like that.
H. After hearing about Jacon Sensei,
peacemakers set out to see her kindness
for himself. He told her about his
vision for a unified nation, describing
a long house with a representative from
each nation in their own seat. Because
she was neutral and well-liked,
peacemaker asked Jon Sensei to assist
him in establishing a system of
governance based on peace. He gave her
the name Mother of Nations, and she
would go on to be instrumental in the
formation of the Hodnosi Confederacy.
Thanks in part to Jakon Sensei, Hodnosi
Law recognizes the equal
responsibilities of women and men in all
manners, which still guides their
practices today.
>> That's right. in that good way.
And that's the story of Jacon Sensei.
Mhm. All these women are definitely
inspiring, but not every Native American
tribe has treated women and men as
equals, which has become something of a
sticky misconception. And while it is
flattering, it's also flattening because
it smooths out the diversity among
Native American cultures. While we're
all pretty awesome, we're also hundreds
of different tribes with different
cultures and values.
Like not all tribes are matriarchal.
Some divided labor strictly along gender
lines and others men held most of the
wealth and power. And to add a further
twist, native people didn't always think
about gender in the same way as
Europeans. In Da culture, for example,
the Nadle embrace both masculine and
feminine energies, and the Da view them
as sacred. And Native Hawaiians have
historically recognized people who
identify as mahu, a word that goes
beyond gender and serves as a bridge
between male and female. The point is,
while plenty of native cultures had some
equality between men and women, there
was also no single way of thinking about
gender. But the onset of European
colonization disrupted gender roles as
it did so many other things.
So many Europeans didn't vibe with the
way women held power in many native
societies. As Lagona PBlo scholar
Polygon Allen put it, the colonizers saw
and rightly that as long as women held
unquestioned power of such magnitude,
attempts at a total conquest of the
continents were bound to fail. Northern
Cheyenne have a saying, ""A nation is not
defeated until the hearts of its women
are on the ground."" So colonizers got to
work dismantling that power. They
stripped native women of the roles and
rights they had for centuries. At times,
this looked like elevating men to
positions of power, but more often than
not, it came in the form of violence
toward native women. Now, we're about to
get into some dark history. This is
heavy stuff, and it's important to take
care. Violence against native women
wasn't a passive byproduct of
colonization. It was targeted and
strategic. Women were often singled out
because of their ability to bear
children, the very thing that was seen
as sacred by many tribes. By killing
native women, colonizers could
destabilize native populations, which
was part of a broader effort to destroy
and replace native people with European
settlers. That's a core part of settler
colonialism, which you can learn more
about in episode one. This violence had
disastrous and widespread consequences.
Thousands of native women were abused
and killed, and tribal culture was
permanently altered for many native
nations like the Chalkaw, whose
matrineal system of heritage was
marginalized by colonial society.
Unfortunately, this type of violence
continued to haunt the United States for
centuries. It still does. For example,
in the 1970s, the federal government
authorized the secret sterilization of
thousands of native women, at least 36
of whom were under the age of 21.
One study found that between 1973 and
1976, 1 in4 American Indian women were
sterilized without their consent.
Some scholars have described violence
against Native women as rare in Native
American societies before the arrival of
Europeans, though today it's a very
different story. Native American women
face some of the highest rates of
violence in the nation, and nearly 96%
of it is committed by non-natives. The
CDC's data from 2018 to 2023 shows that
the third leading cause of death for
native women ages 15 to 24 was homicide.
And for ages 25 to 44, it's in the top
10. Those numbers likely underrepresent
the actual scale of violence. A 2022
report by Amnesty International found
that most law enforcement agencies
either don't record native women's
ethnicity, mislabel them as Hispanic, or
lump them into a catch-all category of
other. This has caused an untold number
of native women's stories to effectively
disappear. To make matters worse, crimes
in Indian country are difficult to bring
to justice because in many cases, Native
American law enforcement isn't able to
prosecute non-native criminals. We get
more into this and other complications
of federal Indian law in episode 16.
Thankfully, Native Activism is making
some headway on this front. The missing
and murdered indigenous women movement
or MMIW is spreading awareness and
advocating for policy change to address
the violence against indigenous women,
indigenous fems, indigenous twospirit
and indigenous girls. And it's making an
impact. In 2020, thanks in part to this
activism, the not invisible act was
signed into law. It created a federal
commission to develop methods for
identifying, reporting, and responding
to instances of missing persons, murder,
and human trafficking on Indian lands
and of Indians. The act itself was
authored by then representative Deb
Holland, a member of the Lagona Pueblo
Nation and the first native woman to
serve as US Secretary of the Interior.
Hey, the first Indian head of the Bureau
of Indian Affairs. How revolutionary.
Thank you, Deb. Thank you, Deb. And of
course, activism and leadership by
Native American women is nothing new and
extends beyond the scope of MMIW alone.
Consider Ladonna Harris, a Comanche
activist who in the 1960s spearheaded
Oklahoma's for Indian opportunity, the
very first intertribal coalition in the
state. This was a big deal in an era
when people from many different native
nations had begun coming together in new
and powerful ways to advocate for
improved conditions. Harris went on to
serve on Lynden B. Johnson's National
Council on Indian Opportunity and later
to found Americans for Indian
Opportunity, a much broader version of
the work she'd begun in Oklahoma. And
let's hear it for Eloise Cobell, also
known as Yellowbird Woman. She was a
tribal elder, activist, banker, and a
member of the Black Feetat Nation who
grew up hearing stories about tribal
members not getting payments they were
owed for use of their land held in trust
by the federal government. Years later,
when she became treasurer of the Black
Feet Nation, she witnessed evidence of
it herself. She found records of oil
being extracted from Black Feet land,
but no record of any payments. So, in
1996, Coobel led the charge in holding
the government accountable. She brought
a class action lawsuit against the
United States for mismanaging trust
funds of over 500,000 Native Americans.
It was a long fight, but in 2010, Coobel
versus Salazar culminated in a $3.4
billion settlement that went toward
getting tribal members the payments they
were owed, restoring fractioned land to
tribal governments, and starting a
scholarship fund. Rest in peace, Eloise.
And plenty of non-native women have been
inspired by the work of native women,
including many early American feminists.
Take Matilda Jocelyn Gage, a 19th
century leader in the women's suffrage
movement. She grew up in New York State
where the Hodnosone Confederacy was
based. You know, the one our girl
Jacconson say helped establish. As she
and others became increasingly
frustrated by resistance to the women's
movement, they found inspiration in
their indigenous neighbors. Gage once
wrote of the Hodnosone Confederacy,
""Never was justice more perfect. Never
was civilization higher.""
The point is, native women impact more
than just native history. We impact all
history. Despite centuries of oppression
and violence, we're still here imparting
wisdom, advocating for change,
exercising leadership, and lifting up
native voices, which is as important
today as it ever was.
In our next episode, we're going to take
a look at the way modern tribal
governments operate. Good luck, Chay.

I grow up.

-zwgHBrGxtk,"This is a map of the 574 federally
recognized tribal nations in what's now
known as the United States. And there's
something weird about it. Well, there's
a lot of things weird about it, but
let's look at this one. A full 40% of
those tribes are in Alaska alone. And
hold on, none of them are in Hawaii.
What's going on here? Hi, I'm Jay Jim
and welcome to Crash Course Native
American History.
[Music]
In many ways, Alaska and Hawaii are
exceptions. They're the only two US
states that are non-ontiguous or not
connected to the mainland. And the
relationships between their native
populations and the US government are
pretty unique, both in comparison to the
other 48 states and to each other. Let's
start with Alaska, which is huge. It's
bigger than Texas, California, and
Montana combined. If it's not the
negative50°ree winters that'll get you,
it'll be the mosquito fililled summers
when the sun never goes down. But
Alaskan naves have thrived here for at
least 10,000 years, living not just on
these lands, but with them.
Traditionally, they've oriented their
lives around a subsistence lifestyle of
hunting, fishing, and gathering with the
seasons. The native nations of Alaska
fall into five major cultural groups,
each with their own distinct languages,
customs, art forms, and histories. And
they're divided pretty evenly across the
state. You've got the Aabaskcans or
Denna in the interior, the Inupia and
St. Lawrence Island up in the north, the
Upupic and Chupek in the southwest, the
Aliu Analutic in the southern stretch of
islands, and the Haida, Kling,
Shimshihan, and Eoch peoples along the
southeastern coast. Alaskan natives
assemble. In some ways, these tribes
experiences of colonization mirror what
happened to native people down south.
They've dealt with disease, forced
conversion to Christianity, and a
devastating loss of land, culture, and
lives. But in other ways, what happened
to Alaska is its own unique story. For
starters, their first colonizers were
Russians. Alaskan natives relationship
with Uncle Sam didn't begin until 1867
when the US purchased Alaska from Russia
for 7.2 $.2 million, which comes out to
about
2 cents an acre.
That'd be a pretty good deal if the land
wasn't, you know, stolen. Over the next
few decades, Alaska became a military
district, then a mining district, then
in 1912, a US territory. But all the
while, Alaskan were like, ""H hello, this
land is still ours."" They never had
actually seated the land in a treaty or
lost it in a war. Russia just kind of
moved in. So Alaskan natives claimed
what the US had purchased wasn't
actually the land itself, but the right
to negotiate for it with them.
Throughout the 19th and early 20th
centuries, Alaskan natives declared
their right to the land as its original
occupants through legal assertions
called land claims. But these were never
fully resolved. For the most part, the
US didn't force Alaskan natives off the
land like they done to so many native
people in the lower 48. But that doesn't
mean they were treated any better. For
three years during World War II, the US
forced over 800 aliu into squalid
internment camps where many died. I'm
going to pause for a moment and let that
sink in. All over, Alaskan natives faced
overt discrimination from settlers.
Businesses commonly posted signs like no
natives allowed and natives need not
apply. A practice that wasn't banned
until a clinket activist Elizabeth
Peratrovich campaigned the state to pass
an anti-discrimination law in 1945.
When Alaska finally became the 49th
state in 1959, the Alaska State Act
recognized the native claim to land
titles they already held. So that's
good. But the act also said the state
could claim any 104 million acres of
public land it wanted so long as it was
vacant, unappropriated, and unreserved.
But since Alaskan natives never seated
their lands, to say that any land was
unappropriated and unreserved was a
stretch. Often the lands the state
called dibs on were traditional hunting
and fishing areas near native villages.
Understandably, many Alaskan natives
felt downright disrespected by these
actions. So, in 1966, more than 400
representatives from 17 native
organizations formed the Alaska
Federation of Natives with the goal of
filing land claims all over the state.
They pushed for a land freeze, demanding
no new claims by the state until native
land claims were settled, and the US
government agreed. Then, in 1971, a
groundbreaking settlement was reached.
The Alaskan Native Claim Settlement Act
or the ANCSA,
Alaskan Natives agreed to give up their
claim of the whole state, all 360
million acres. In return, they receive a
smaller slice, 43.7 million acres and
962.5
million. That land and money would be
split among a bunch of newly formed
corporations, which Alaskan natives
could use to benefit native communities.
No native nation in the lower 48 had
done anything like this. It was
powerful, but the tribes still weren't
fed recognized nations, which matters a
lot for issues of sovereignty or the
ability to self-govern. There's much
more on tribal sovereignty in episode 2.
Throughout the 1980s, Native Alaskan
communities advocated for this
recognition in state courts until
finally in 1993, the US government
recognized all Alaskan Native entities,
meaning all those corporations as
officially sovereign governments with
the same protections, powers, and
limitations as any other fedally
recognized native nation. And that's why
today a whopping 229 of the 574 fedally
recognized native nations in the US are
in Alaska. Weird, but true. Now, let's
fly over to Hawaii. The story here is
kind of the opposite. There are no
fairly recognized native nations, and it
might surprise you to learn that many
Native Hawaiians don't want there to be.
But to understand why, we've got to wrap
our heads around their unique
relationship with the United States.
Native Hawaiians, who call themselves
Kuckamali, are the descendants of
Polynesian navigators who arrived on the
islands more than 2,000 years ago. They
developed specialized ways of thriving
there like slashing, burning, and
rotating patches of jungle as gardens
and building canals and terraces that
directed water towards their crops. And
the Kanuka Maui have nurtured a profound
connection to these islands. To this
day, many keep relationships with
ancestral spirits or omokua, thought to
sometimes take the form of plants,
rocks, and animals. And they recite the
kumu liipo, a creation chant that
describes how the universe began from an
enormous burst of heat, giving rise to
day and night, earth and sky, male and
female, and a whole family tree of life.
But as soon as the first Europeans set
foot on the islands in 1778,
more and more Western settlers swept in,
and in an all too familiar story, they
brought diseases that wiped out over 80%
of the native population.
Yes, unfortunately you heard that right,
80%.
Throughout the 19th century, those
settlers and their descendants
accumulated more influence, land, and
wealth, growing rich off of sugar
plantations. And as the turn of the
century approached, they took it to the
next level. See, in 1891, Lelukani
became the kingdom of Hawaii's first and
last queen. Her power was limited,
though, because a few years prior, a
militia of white businessmen had forced
her brother, literally at gunpoint, to
sign away much of it, including native
voting rights, while simultaneously
giving voting rights to white landowning
non-citizens. Their ultimate goal, make
Hawaii a US territory and reap the
profit. Leelu Ookani, though, refused to
recognize these limitations and worked
to restore power to the Kunaka Maui. But
then in 1893, members of his secret
society invaded the palace, backed by
over 160 US troops.
Leeli Owokani, fearing war if she didn't
comply with their demands, gave up her
authority. While all that was happening,
white elites had been working to
Americanize Hawaii, turning the palace
into their government's central
headquarters, requiring English in
schools, and generally trying to cover
up any evidence that the Kanaka Maui
were ever sovereign at all. In 1898, the
US officially annexed Hawaii, claiming
it as a US territory. Congress claimed
the Hawaiian government was 100% on
board with seeding sovereignty, even
though over 21,000 Kakamaui citizens had
petitioned against it. Over the next 60
years, US citizens from the mainland
moved in droves to Hawaii, eventually
outnumbering natives. And in 1959 when
the US popped the big do you want to
become a state question, 93% of voters
said yes. But remember, many of those
voters were US citizens from the
mainland, not natives. And some native
scholars and activists argue that the
vote didn't follow international rules
laid out by the United Nations, like
offering independence as a third option
on the ballot. Fast forward to 1993, 100
years after a secret club took over a
kingdom. The US Congress apologized for
how it all went down. They acknowledged
that the Americans had conspired
illegally to take over a lawful
government and that the Kuckamali never
directly gave up their land or their
sovereignty. Symbolically, apologizing
was a huge step, but legally it didn't
change anything. In 2009, the Supreme
Court ruled that acknowledging the state
of Hawaii's crooked origin story hadn't
created any new rights for the Kuckam
Maui or restored any claims over their
lands. Today, they still don't have
formal federal recognition as a
sovereign nation. It was all sizzle, no
stake. And the Kanaka Maui are divided
on if they even want federal
recognition. Those in favor say it would
make it easier to address inequality and
advocate for native interests. But those
opposed often argue that the Kingdom of
Hawaii still exists. It was and is
illegally occupied. Many say that
accepting federal recognition would mean
giving up the goal of becoming a truly
independent nation once more. So, it's a
complicated situation. Like other native
people in the lower 48, both the Kuck
Maui and Alaskan natives have faced
political marginalization and
discrimination. They've weathered
systematic efforts to get rid of their
language and culture. And compared to
white Americans, they face higher rates
of poverty and preventable illness and
have more trouble accessing healthcare
and education. The Kucka Maui and
Alaskan native relationship with the US
have taken very different courses from
those of many other native nations and
that's given rise to totally unique
legal situations. The more we learn
about them, the better we can understand
the diversity of Native American history
and Native life today. In our next
episode, we're going to talk about
indigenous women's history. And I will
see you then. Thanks for watching this

OwTGMhxL22o,"You might recognize this famous fearless
lunch. But did you know that many of
those men, the ones who built New York
Skyline, were native known as the
Skywalkers? These Mohawk iron workers
braved the heights to create the Big
Apple you know today. They literally
built one of the most famous cities in
the world. So why do we rarely talk
about natives living in cities? Hi, I'm
Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.
[Music]
In episode 14, we talked about the
relocation and termination era, the
period between the 1950s and60s when the
US government attempted to get rid of
Native Americans altogether through two
main methods. Relocating Native
individuals to cities where they would
assimilate or disappear into mainstream
American culture and ending the federal
recognition of over a 100 tribes. It was
a rough time or not a vibe in Gen Z
terms. Today, we're going to grapple
with the fallout from that first
element, relocation, and how it created
a whole new way to be Indian, for better
or worse. Let's kick back up in the
early 1950s. Like I mentioned in episode
14, in the wake of World War II, the US
federal government was looking for ways
to cut cost. All those nukes cost money.
And on the chopping block yet again was
fulfilling their agreements to native
people, this time on reservations. So
through some complicated maneuvering,
they moved many of us off of
reservations and into luxurious beach
cabanas. Just kidding. They moved us
into cities. The new commissioner of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, or BIA, Dylan
S. Meyer, thought reservations were
overpopulated and not worth investing
in. So his plan was to offer Native
Americans a one-way ticket to the city
where they could blend into mainstream
society. That would leave their
reservation lands ready and available
for taxation and sale. With no
reservations and NATO's fully
assimilated, the government would get
out of the promises they had made in
treaties and would close the Bureau of
Indian Affairs for good. Goodbye
reservations. Goodbye treaty promises.
Goodbye Indians. This plan came from the
same guy who' led the forced interament
of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans
during World War II. So yeah, yikes.
Rest assured, the ancestors had a word
with him in the afterlife. The
cornerstone of Meyer's plan was a
relocation program which the Bureau of
Indian Affairs launched in 1953.
It offered a paid ride and a month's
stipen to any native person willing to
relocate to a city, promising they'd
find plenty of good jobs, good schools,
and good housing. Basically, the stuff
of a better life. Eventually, the BIA
added job training to the mix. So many
natives were willing to relocate that
the BIA got more applications than it
could actually accept.
But for many, those big promises weren't
what they were cracked up to be. Instead
of prosperity, many natives found scarce
housing and low-end jobs. They
experienced culture shock and racism,
all without the support of their
communities back home. Many native
people left. Others wanted to leave, but
had no way of getting back to their
reservations. Between 1953 and 1973,
it's estimated that at least 100,000
Native Americans moved to cities like
Chicago, Denver, LA, San Francisco, and
Cleveland. Yes, even Cleveland. Those
poor souls. And the BIA didn't measure
the relocation program success by how
well people did in those cities, but how
many people were still in those cities a
year later, whether they wanted to be or
not. Because as long as natives were off
reservations to the US government, they
were now invisible. And in some ways
natives who live in cities are still
invisible. Because while we know that
today a lot of native folks live urban
lives, we don't actually know how many.
Like the 2020 US census found that
nearly seven in 10 people who identify
as American Indian or Alaskan Native
live in urban areas. But three years
earlier, researchers at the Department
of Housing and Urban Development had
reported exactly the opposite. The math
ain't mathing. It turns out that there
are a couple things going on here. For
one, on the census, the American Indian
category includes anyone with indigenous
ancestry from anywhere in the Americas,
not just what's now the US. Like two of
the most common identities reported in
2020 were Aztec and Maya. Groups that go
back hundreds or even thousands of years
down in Mexico, our brothers from down
under. But second, the census reflects
how many people self-identified as
having indigenous ancestry, which
doesn't necessarily mean someone is a
tribal member. Like in 2023, the
Cherokee Nation had 450,000 enrolled
members. And the smaller Cherokee bands,
the United Cuba Band and the Eastern
Band, each had more than 14,000 members.
Nothing to sneeze at, but over three
times that many people had reported
Cherokee ancestry on the census. What is
it with the math around here? Well, some
of that discrepancy comes from different
definitions of who counts as Cherokee.
It's impossible to know how many of
those 1.5 million people who claim
native ancestry actually meet the
requirements for tribal membership
versus how many of them have heard a
family story about their great great
grandma who was a Cherokee princess. Cuz
actually, the Cherokee never had
princesses.
The point is, nobody's 100% sure how
many native people today live in cities.
Not even me, and I usually know
everything. Side note, to this day,
native people living in cities sometimes
get described as urban Indians. But that
can create a kind of false dichotomy
between city Indians and res Indians.
While urban Indians don't really exist,
native people experiencing urban life
do. Besides, there are Indians living
everywhere, even in space. Who let you
up there, chief? you see ET anywhere?
And you might be like, Chay, who cares
if we don't know the exact number? We
know it's a lot. Isn't that enough?
Can't you just be happy? But here's the
thing. Not being counted matters.
Policies are only as good as the data
they're informed by. If we don't have
the data, then we don't know how much
money to allocate to important programs,
which is a big deal when natives living
in cities experience poverty and
unemployment at higher rates than other
Americans, among other difficulties.
Take the Indian Health Service, the
fedally funded health care provider for
members of federally recognized tribes.
Despite the high population of native
people in urban areas, only 1% of IHS's
budget is earmarked for cities. So,
urban clinics are few and far between.
Even if a native person does live in a
city with one of these clinics, lack of
time and money can make it hard to get
to one. But urban Indian organizations
are striving to change that. For
example, the National Urban Indian
Family Coalition, a group of 40
nonprofits, led the hashtag
statistically significant campaign,
which encouraged natives and cities to
respond to the 2020 US census so that
their numbers could be counted and their
needs met. And so that maybe one day the
math can math. And that points to
something huge that the BIA didn't
anticipate. Native people didn't just
disappear in cities. Instead, these
seemingly invisible native people looked
for and found each other. Despite many
tribal differences, they found common
ground and used it to voice their
collective power. Intertribal activist
organizations like the Red Power
Movement and its offshoot, the American
Indian Movement, sprouted in cities
during the 1960s and 70s, promoting
native pride and organizing protests to
call attention to injustices. People
from many different native nations came
together to assert their treaty rights.
improve living conditions and fill in
the gaps where the government had failed
them. Like in the late 1960s, members of
the American Indian Movement in
Minneapolis, Minnesota, tried to figure
out how to address problems for native
folks like housing discrimination and
isolation from their cultures. And in
1973, Little Earth was born, the first
and only subsidized housing complex in
the US to give preference to natives. To
this day, Little Earth offers services
for native residents like rides to
school, food banks, and doctor visits,
tutoring and support groups. There's an
urban farm that grows medicinal plants
like sweetgrass and sage. A nightly
community patrol to deescalate conflict,
an arts collective, seasonal ceremonies,
and pow-wows and mentorship from elders.
Today, Little Earth is home to about
1,000 residents from more than 30 native
nations, and it's just one of many
cross-tribal organizations and cultural
centers that continue to maintain native
community in urban areas. So, relocation
created a whole new experience for
native people, one of managing their
traditions and cultural identity while
in an urban setting, and it caused
native people from totally different
tribes to come together in new ways.
Sounds pretty good, right? As with so
many things, there's a flip side to
this. What if coming together across
native cultures actually made natives
less visible, not more? I'll let
Cherokee scholar and activist Robert
Thomas explain. In the 1970s, he warned
that natives living in cities were at
risk of being cut off from their
cultures and the natural world. He
feared that unique tribal identities
would soon be replaced by a single idea
of what it means to be Indian. Like
instead of having New York style pizza,
Chicago style pizza, and Detroit style
pizza, we just had pizza. This idea is
called panindianism. It's a political
philosophy that's either positive or
negative depending on your perspective.
Some native people see it as
representing intertribal unity and
working towards common goals, while
others see it as a blending together of
distinct tribal identities into generic
sameness. To this day, natives debate
whether panindianism in cities is good
or bad. Does banning together over a
common Indianness support native nation
sovereignty or does it threaten it?
Scholar Sydney Anne Beckman argues that
this debate is missing the forest for
the trees. It perpetuates quote the idea
that indigenous people and cultures
cannot exist in urban spaces and that
indigenous land ends at city limits
which as we've seen couldn't be further
from the truth. It's not the possibility
of Native urban life that's up for
debate. It's the quality of it. No
matter their perspective, there's no
denying that Native Americans are here
in full force. We're in cities just as
much as we're on reservations, and we've
refused to be invisible in a variety of
ways, like by banning together to
provide mutual support and by
celebrating our uniqueness across
cultures.
Today, 50 years after relocation
officially ended, we continue to define
and redefine what it means to be native
in the city. As the Cheyenne and Arapjo
writer Tommy Orange wrote, ""The city
made us new, and we made it ours."" Next
time, we're dive into the unique
histories of Alaskan natives and Native
Hawaiians, and I will see you then.

0QIbyjF5FRw,"Oh, for me.
All right. This week's episode, Federal
Indian Law. Good luck. No.
Hi, I'm Jay Jim and this is Crash Course
Native American History.
What if you had a passport that wouldn't
let you come home? In 2010, the Hon
Nationals planned to fly to the United
Kingdom to compete in the World Lacrosse
Championships, a sport the Honosi
invented, by the way, but the US refused
to recognize the players passports and
the UK wouldn't let them in if they
couldn't go back home. And to understand
why, we've got to talk about this. Well,
not this exactly, but an equally
confusing tangle called Federal Indian
Law. So what is federal Indian law?
Basically, it comprises all the legal
decisions past and present that affect
native people's lives today. But it's
also really difficult to describe
because it's not just one thing. It's
thousands of treaties, executive orders,
administrative decisions, statutes, and
court cases. It's hundreds of years of
interactions between tribes and the
federal government. It's, in a word, a
lot. Even some government websites have
called it things like incredibly
complex. Again, a lot like this. So, why
is there a separate set of rules for
Native Americans? Well, federal Indian
law exists because native nations never
gave up their sovereignty, the inherent
right to govern themselves, something
you can learn more about in episode 2.
That right remained even after the
United States was founded, which you can
learn about in um pretty much every
episode of the series. Under federal
Indian law today, tribes are legally
considered domestic dependent nations,
which means they're sovereign, yes, but
Congress can put limits on their
sovereignty. And those moving boundaries
are what make federal Indian law so
complex. Clear as mud? Don't worry,
we're going to break it down. We're
considering examples across multiple
levels to see how federal Indian law
affects individuals, entire communities,
and land. though, as you'll see, there's
a lot of overlap between the three.
Let's start on the individual level.
Returning to our athletic friends, the
Hosoni lacrosse team, in 2010, the US
said they wouldn't accept the trib's
passports as legit for re-entry because
they didn't recognize the Hneson as a
fully sovereign nation. In other words,
if it's not a real nation, it can't make
a real passport. Never mind, the Honi
citizens had been able to travel
internationally for over 20 years by
that point. But they did offer the
lacrosse players an exception. Fly with
the passports just as once. But the
players didn't want a one-time thing.
They wanted full recognition of their
right to self-govern. So they chose to
miss their tournament rather than accept
anything less. This is just one piece of
the puzzle, one example out of thousands
of ways, large and small, that these
laws impact native people. And not just
international lacrosse teams, but your
neighbors, teachers, and friends. and
sometimes with dire consequences. Just a
heads up, I'm about to go into some
pretty heavy truths, so please take care
as you watch on. Today, there is a
crisis of missing and murdered
indigenous women. Indigenous women are
killed at a rate 10 times higher than
the national average. They're more
likely than other populations to be
assaulted or stalked in their lifetimes,
and the vast majority identify their
attackers as nonIndians.
But under federal law, tribes are
limited in what they can do to solve
these crimes because they generally
don't have full authority to prosecute
non-Indians, which goes back to those
fuzzy boundaries around sovereignty.
Federal Indian law says tribal nations
have the right to govern themselves, but
not to exercise governance over
non-natives. So, criminals can sometimes
go unpunished through this loophole. The
Violence Against Women Act has tried to
address this problem by giving tribes
jurisdiction over non-Indians in
instances of sexual violence, stalking
or assault on tribal land. But even
then, tribal ability to punish
non-Indians remains limited. Because the
laws are so complicated, indigenous
women are treated differently from other
victims. And usually, this means the
investigations are a lot slower, which
makes it all too easy for the cycle of
violence to continue.
Like I said, this is heavy stuff, but I
hope the more that we understand it, the
more we can work to solve it. Now, we've
seen how federal Indian law can impact
individuals when traveling or when
victims of a crime. But to take it even
further, let's look at how the law
impacts whole communities. To start,
have you noticed I keep using the word
Indian rather than Native American?
Well, that's because federal Indian law
only applies to American Indians, which
unlike Native American, is the official
legal term for enrolled members of
federally recognized tribes.
My eyes hurt from all the fine print,
y'all. There are many people who are
members of a tribe, but whose tribe
isn't recognized as a nation by the US
governments. So, they aren't covered
under the American Indian label, at
least by law. On top of that, each tribe
has its own requirements for membership.
So, you can't just say I'm Navajo based
on your 23 and me results any more than
I can say I'm a Swedish citizen based on
my Swedish chef impression.
Anyway, there's more about native
identity in episode 4. Now, whether or
not we're recognized as Indian by the
government doesn't change the fact that
we're US citizens with all the perks
that come with that, like the right to
vote. But in other ways, it could have a
huge impact, like massive. See, as of
2024, 574 tribes are federally
recognized as tribal nations. And since
the 1830s, the US government has abided
by what's called a trust responsibility
to those tribes. Basically, that means
it has a legal and moral obligation to
protect them and their members forever.
That obligation is based on
interpretations of the Constitution,
statutes, and treaties. The trust
responsibility through a government
agency called the Bureau of Indian
Affairs or BIA helps fund basic services
like schools and electricity. They build
and maintain roads, bridges, and dams on
reservations. There's a division for
fighting wildfires, a division for
connecting reservations to highspeed
internet, and a program for bringing
bison back to tribal lands. Sadly, they
rejected my suggestion for an Indian
taco division. There's even a branch of
tribal climate resilience which is all
about supporting tribes ability to adapt
to a warming world and that could have
huge impacts on communities like since
2022 the Senoma Indian tribal community
has gotten support from the BIA to
revive their traditional practice of
clam gardening. Clam gardens have been
maintained for centuries by the
Swanomish. The gardens are filled with
minerals that help clams build shells,
which in turn creates a more stable
tidal ecosystem and offers protection
from things like sea level rise and
ocean acidification. One Swenomish
tribal member, Joe Williams, describes
the program as looking to our ancestors
playbook on how to adapt to climate
change. So, the trust responsibility at
the core of federal Indian law can be
acted out in a lot of helpful ways, but
this support is only offered to
federally recognized tribes. Meanwhile,
hundreds of tribes don't have federal
recognition. Many have their recognition
legally terminated by the US government,
and it's a long, difficult, expensive
process to get it back, which you can
learn more about in episode 14. For
those tribes, there is no government
support. Okay, I think I think I got it.
Wait,
never mind. Where were we? Right. The
ever complex tango of law. So, we've
seen how federal Indian law impacts
individuals and whole communities. Now,
let's look at how it applies to land.
And really, all these layers are
connected. Take the term Indian country.
To us, that's just another word for
home. But it's also a legal term that
broadly describes land held in trust for
Native American tribes, which includes
lots of different types of lands. All of
it governed by federal Indian law. All
told, about 56 million acres of land in
Indian country is held in trust by the
federal government. That means while the
land officially exists for the benefit
of the individual tribe or Indian, the
federal government holds its legal
title. Which means tribes face far more
barriers to using their land than
private land owners would. Like in 2014,
a crow citizen followed a herd of elk
off his reservation and into a national
forest, then carried the meat back home.
The state of Wyoming found him guilty of
hunting elk illegally off his
reservation. But sometimes federal
Indian law can actually be used to
defend the rights of tribal members. The
Crow tribe brought this case all the way
to the Supreme Court. They pointed to
the 1868 treaty where they seated much
of their land with the guarantee that
they'd still be able to hunt on it. The
Supreme Court sided with the Crow tribe
and affirmed that they still had the
right to hunt on the land as they always
had.
So yeah, federal Indian law is
complicated. It's a complex puzzle made
of centuries old treaties and court
cases decided as recently as today. This
sprawling body of law affects individual
native people, our community, and even
our land. But like I said before, all
these things are connected. The law
continues to evolve, and we continue to
fight to affirm our sovereignty to this
day. Speaking of which, the Hon
Nationals didn't stop fighting for
theirs. In 2022, they flew to Ireland
for the World Lacrosse Championships
where they were welcomed with open arms
and a stamp on their Hesony passports.
Next time, we'll talk about what it
means to be a native in the city. And I
will see you then. Thanks for watching

c7wCbbmLtiI,"What if I told you that there was an
incantation that could control people's
minds? A certain combination of words
used in the right order to bend people
to your will. What if there were whole
vocabularies of these complicated mazes
of buzzwords, mantras, euphemisms,
cliches, and redefinitions?
And these all add up to a kind of
spellbook that a select few of history's
greatest influencers secretly possess.
From Jesus to Jim Jones to Jeff Bezos,
but also Taylor Swift, Pelaton
instructors, and even old friends
selling essential oils in your DMs. And
here is the kicker. You are probably
under the spell of these words right
now.
This is a story about words. Words that
alter the course of history. Words that
hold invisible power. Power that can be
used for good or for evil. Hi, I'm
Amanda Montel and I'm a devoted follower
of the cult of social science. I'm a
social commentator with a background in
linguistics and the author of
non-fiction books including cultish and
the age of magical overthinking. Welcome
to a crash course lecture.
[Music]
If I described my yoga studio as a cult,
a certain image might come to mind. It's
not a cult really, but there's something
about it that's definitely cultish.
Cultesque, and that's something, it's
language. The language some fitness
studios use is striking. It's driven by
ideology, ritual, even dogma. They
promise a kind of belonging that isn't
necessarily bad, but it is at the very
least alternative. And it's not just
yoga studios and CrossFit gyms. There's
cultishness in the places we work, the
places we go for fun, and in our social
media feeds. This kind of language is
everywhere. Each of us is constantly
influenced by the very same language
strategies that created notorious cults
like Jonestown, Heavensgate, and Cinon.
Cultishness has been around throughout
human history, but it's different now,
ramped up. If you ask me, today we're
living in the most cultish era of all
time. Why? It's complicated. The modern
world is chaotic. Our systems are
riddled with labor and wealth
imbalances. Ads and influencers are
pushing us to consume more, while
environmentalists warn us we should be
consuming less. And the crushing
pressure to self-brand online has made
us so anxious that our cravings for
validation have become insatiable.
Not speaking from experience or
anything. In the past, during times of
turmoil, many people found at least some
comfort or guidance from traditional
authority figures like church leaders,
the government, news reporters, and
medical providers. But here in the US
over the last 50 years, our faith in
institutions has been in steady decline.
So much for comfort and guidance.
Meanwhile, in my friend group, we often
joke about starting a commune to deal
with housing costs. A compound just
makes sense in this economy. Are we
joking, though?
[Music]
These conundrums are all eerily
familiar. They remind me a great deal of
another time in history that I am very
familiar with. They remind me of the
world my dad Craig grew up in in the
1960s.
I was raised on my dad's stranger than
fiction tales. Stories of this remote
stretch of land in California where kids
didn't go to a real school and adults
had to shave their heads if they broke a
rule. Stories about how his parents,
seeking a life free from the obsession
with work and wealth, took him and his
halfsisters and joined a cult. This tale
starts in 1969,
a time of incredible socopolitical
unrest in the United States. We're on
the heels of the John F. Kennedy
assassination
and civil rights movement
were in the throws of the Vietnam War.
In the face of all this, in the 1960s
and '7s, countercultural groups started
springing up full of people seeking ways
to thrive without relying on those
systems. from Woodstock era hippies and
transcendental meditators to more
sinister groups like the way
international and Scientology. It was so
dramatic that some scholars refer to
this period in the mid- 20th century as
the fourth great awakening, grouping it
together with other major religious
transitions in American history. And
here we find my dad or the person who
would become my dad because Craig was
all of 14 when he moved with his family
to Cinon.
Cinanon was a community that started as
an alternative drug rehab center but
expanded to attract lifestylers like my
grandparents. That was the word for
so-called squares who didn't need rehab
but still wanted in on this lifestyle
experiment. Best thing for people is
people and Cinon provides the
environment to bring together peoples
from all walks of life.
>> Cinon was the antidote to all the
problems of the modern day. Offering a
template for who to be and how to live
morally, sustainably, healthfully, which
I get. It relieved some of that stress I
mentioned at the start. It provided that
missing comfort and guidance. And at its
best, Cinanon was saving people's lives.
Moving there was truly transformative
for many, including talented artists and
musicians who chose to trade their
addictions for playing nightly tunes and
getting high on nothing but group
bonding. But from my dad's perspective,
things in Cinon were a little weird.
Like everyone dressed alike. Overalls,
short haircuts. It was actually pretty
hip by today's standards. Cult chic,
compound casual. members used all kinds
of special words and did mandatory
rituals. But the thing that really
freaked out my dad was how everyone was
so obsessed with Cinanon's visionary
leader, Chuck Dedric, a normal guy who
they treated as a man god.
So my dad became a loner just trying to
fly under the radar. As I grew up, I
became fascinated by groups like this,
wondering what drives the irrational and
overly uniform beliefs within them. And
I started to notice something. The same
kind of language that Cinanon used to
recruit and isolate their followers. It
was everywhere. This language can be
found in our everyday lives,
manipulating us even and especially in
places we wouldn't expect.
[Music]
But pause. Before we get much deeper, we
should figure out what the word cult
even means. Because on the surface, an
exercise bike company and a sober
compound in the hills don't have all
that much in common. I've heard it said
that cults are like porn. It's a joke
that references a famous 1964 Supreme
Court case where when asked for a
definition of pornography, Justice
Potter Stewart said, ""I know it when I
see it."" As soon as I say the word cult,
you might picture a certain image of
robes, a kind of dazed look, super long
hair, dirty feet. But that's just a
stereotype. The word cult hasn't always
had sinister undertones at all. Let's
take a detour to the 17th century. The
earliest written usage of cult traces
back to the 1600s when the word meant
homage paid to divinity or offerings to
win over the gods. 200 years later, by
the mid 1800s, cult evolved to mean a
kind of churchly categorization, more
like sect, used specifically to describe
ancient or primitive systems of
religious belief. The word conoted
something unorthodox maybe, but not
necessarily malignant. Around this time,
dozens of sociospiritual clicks were
cropping up and fading in the US.
Polyamorous communists, egalitarian
inventors, vegan farmers. There was
basically a cult or sect for anyone. I
mean, one of the reasons the US was
founded was for religious freedom. And
America had gained a reputation as the
sort of place where you were free to get
as socioposiritually freaky as you
liked.
It wasn't until the 1960s and 70s that
the word cult started gaining a darker
reputation.
The mass emergence of non-conformist
spiritual groups unsettled traditional
Christians.
Then came several high-profile cult
related tragedies. The Manson family
murders of 1969 where celebrities and
everyday people were killed in their
homes. and the Jonestown massacre of
1978 where over 900 people unwillingly
took their lives under the influence of
their leader. From there, the word cult
was solidified as a national symbol of
peril. What followed was a period in the
1980s known as the satanic panic when
conspiracy theories about cults abusing
suburban kids spread around the US like
wildfire.
Here's what I find especially
interesting, though. As soon as cult
became synonymous with harm and infamy
in the 70s, it also became kind of cool.
That's why we have slang like cult
following and cult classic to describe
midnight showings of the Rocky Horror
Picture Show or the followings of jam
bands like the Grateful Dead. This wink
wink hyperbolic interpretation of the
word to describe devoted fan bases is
why I can cheekily reference soul cycle
as a cult brand or describe Disney
adults as culty. And you know I'm not
talking about communes and death. At
least hopefully not. Which brings us
back to the task at hand. I was supposed
to be defining cult here but as you can
see it's really hard. You understand how
we get to I know it when I see it.
Because that's the thing about language.
In everyday practice, definitions are
determined not by academics or
dictionary makers, but by us, the
speakers. Meaning depends on the person
you're talking to and the context. Like
when cult is used to write off groups
that mainstream society judges, folk
magic practitioners, for example.
There's more on that aspect of the term
in Crash Course Religions. But when it
comes to sinister cults, it can be
helpful to have a less vibes driven
definition. A number of psychologists
have developed rubrics for this. They
include things like, does it have a
charismatic and idol worshipped leader
who offers validation and is the only
source of truth and wisdom? Is there
abuse, including financial, sexual, and
or labor exploitation? Is there extreme
paranoia about the outside world and no
tolerance for questioning? Is there
meaningful financial transparency and is
there a viable exit strategy? That's the
checklist I tend to use personally and
it comes in part from psychiatrist
Robert J. Lifton and in part from the
Cult Education Institute. There's
ongoing disagreement among scholars
about what should go on these lists. But
the point is when I say something is
cultish, it usually checks off at least
one of these boxes. The checklist can be
applied broadly. Like I can think of
some celebrated Hollywood clicks,
Silicon Valley companies, and fitness
studios that check some of these. And
unfortunately, you won't find a major
religion that doesn't check some of them
either. But I see the world through a
socio- linguistics lens. So for me, the
most interesting connection here isn't
that you can find abuses of power
everywhere. It's that you can find the
same type of language everywhere.
strategic language that holds a lot of
power and influence. Society has changed
since 1969 when my dad joined Cinon and
it's primed us to become the most
cultish era ever.
[Music]
But before we can get into the real
cultine, we've got to understand what
happened in the 1960s when my dad moved
with my grandparents to Cinon. It was a
time of cultural turbulence and fear,
not all that different from today. But
this was also before the internet,
before social media. To learn about
Cinanon, my grandfather had to get up,
leave the house, and talk to people in
person. Contain your shock, Jenzie. But
in today's world, we're more isolated.
In 2024, an American Psychiatric
Association poll surveyed over 2,000
American adults and found that 30% had
felt lonely every single week during the
last year. So, how did this happen?
According to a 2024 survey from Harvard,
participants reported being overworked,
not seeing family enough, a lack of
spiritual life, and the biggest culprit
for loneliness is digital technology.
Let's be real, skimming through your
friend's life updates isn't the same as
catching up IRL. Add to all this the
fact that we've basically got a tragedy
on demand machine in our pocket at all
times. A 2019 report from John's Hopkins
University looked at young people who
spent more than 3 hours per day on
social media, and it found that those
people internalized problems more,
making it harder to cope with depression
and anxiety. So many of us are more
disconnected than ever while also
carrying the weight of the world in our
pockets. It's like we've forgotten we're
humans. We're all about community. It's
part of how we managed to survive as a
species for so long. And if we're not
getting community in person, many will
try to fill that relationship void some
other way. Cue the heavenly internet. #
blessing us with the keys to find any
kind of community we could ever want. In
a way, that's beautiful. But when I say
any kind of community, I mean any kind,
including fanatical fringe groups with
charismatic leaders who are paranoid
about outsiders who think they have all
the answers and whose beliefs are
dangerous to question. Unlike my
grandfather, we don't have to leave our
homes to subscribe to new ideologies. We
can be profoundly influenced without
even leaving the couch. Today, most
zealous fringe groups build a digital
system of morality and community. And in
lie of a physical meeting place, jargon
gives them something to assemble around.
I'll never forget when I first
downloaded Instagram in the summer of
2012. I was struck that the app called
its account holders followers instead of
friends or connections. It's like a cult
platform. I remember saying, ""Is it not
encouraging everyone to build their own
little cult?"" And while these platforms
claim to make an effort to stop truly
dangerous ideas and disinformation from
spreading, those safety nets certainly
don't catch everything. Ultimately,
algorithms tend to prioritize spicy
content, whether or not it's true. In
fact, one 2018 MIT study found it takes
true stories about six times longer than
false ones to reach 1500 people on the
app formerly known as Twitter. Why?
Because false information seems more
novel, more exclusive, and wise,
authentic in its outlandishness.
Here's an example of how this has
worked. QAnon, a disperate online group
which has been linked to real world
extremist violence. Q Anon involves a
kind of spiderweb of different
conspiracy theories, rituals, and
buzzwords, all of which promise answers
in these uncertain times. The most
extreme of QAnon's ideologies attest
that an evil cabal of elites or satan
worshipping child abusers secretly runs
Hollywood, the media, and the Democratic
Party. And Donald Trump was divinely
sent to save America and the world from
this vast evil. Q Anon rose in fame and
popularity not through in-person
meetings but rather internet forums and
social media posts. Qanoners use a
glossery of lofty, vague, and
everchanging vocabulary like 5D
consciousness and do the research in
order to intrigue curious recruits who
might not get on board with overtly
violent language out of the gate. They
also do this to avoid the surveillance
of social media companies who might be
on high alert for QAnon threats and shut
down accounts that use certain
terminology. It's easy enough to dismiss
online cults as not threatening in the
real world, but the influence of groups
like QAnon has led to very real harm.
For example, in 2016, a man radicalized
online showed up at a pizza parlor in DC
that was the center of a bogus
conspiracy theory. It was spread on
sites like 4chan, which became a major
hub for KQAnon. He opened fire in the
restaurant and told police he was there
to self-investigate the conspiracy
theory.
Of course, KQanon is not the cult for
everyone. But what about influencer
fandoms, which seem positive at first,
but end up taking over someone's whole
value system? In today's world, many of
us find ourselves in parasocial
relationships where we feel like we have
a special connection with someone we see
online. And when someone makes us feel
known and seen, especially if we're
isolated from the people around us,
that's a well doumented risk factor for
falling prey to charismatic cult
leaders. So in 2025, our ultimate cult
leader may be father algorithm and
comment sections are new compound. It's
easier than ever to fall into nefarious
ideas or get wrapped up in something
cultish. And the really wild thing is
the language tricks that cult leaders
use, our brains are actually wired to
fall for them.
[Music]
So, what are those tricks and how do
they work? Enter the game. The most
memorable of my dad's Cinon stories had
to do with something called the game.
The game was the centerpiece of Cinon
life, and it was essentially a form of
endurance training or group therapy
where followers gathered around in
so-called tribes and were invited to
single out other members to verbally
berate them. The game could be hostile
and even traumatizing. And yet in
Cinanon language, it was described as
something you played. And playing was
required even for kids. It happened
several nights a week and might involve,
say, one member calling out another with
whom they had personal beef and shouting
at them for being lazy or spoiled. This
was called a pull-up. Then others were
encouraged to join in on the vitriol,
also known as backing the play. Life in
Cinon was framed within two rhetorical
categories, in the game and out of the
game. And when you were in the game,
nothing else in the world existed. After
the game was finished, you were supposed
to compartmentalize, move on with your
daily Cinon tasks as if you hadn't just
been verbally maligned for 7 hours,
you know. And people say, ""Well, what is
the Cinon lifestyle?"" We all play the
game here, the Cinon game. and that the
contrast between the game and the notame
is what makes up the lifestyle.
>> When I heard about all this, I was
fascinated by the way Cinanon used
euphemisms and insidery buzzwords to
reshape followers reality. It sent a
shiver down my spine. My dad said that
some members, like my grandfather, were
actually addicted to it. In this way,
the game kind of reminds me of when
online comment sections get really
heated. You know when people can't stop
posting negative or conspiratorial
comments, thinking they're calling
someone out for some moral infraction,
but really they're just aiming for clout
and maybe catharsis. Let me know what
you think of that idea in the comments
below. The Cinon game was like that, but
in real life. Describing what it felt
like to play the game at 14, my dad
said, ""To me, the torrent of heated
accusations felt like verbal carpet
bombing. I wished I were invisible."" He
felt constantly gaslit, trapped in the
linguistic prison of the game.
Okay, buckle up. Things are about to get
nerdy. In linguistics, there's a concept
known as the theory of performativity,
which argues that language doesn't just
describe or reflect our reality, it
creates it. The idea here is that speech
itself has the ability to cause
measurable changes in the world. If that
sounds a little hocus pocus, think about
when a justice of the peace pronounces a
couple married or when an umpire calls
you're out. That's how that works,
right? Not really in the cult of sports.
And in synonyon, that exclusive, heavily
repeated jargon, including phrases like
in the game and out of the game, plus
all the charged verbiage wielded during
the game itself, worked to create a new
reality for followers. Studies have
shown that repeating words and phrases
makes our beliefs stronger. This is a
describable phenomenon. It's called the
illusory truth effect. The illusory
truth effect is one of many mental
shortcuts that our brains used to make
efficient decisions. And for most of
human history before a time when
misinformation could spread so fast and
far online, the illusory truth effect
worked well enough. Like picture you're
a hunter gatherer. You're not on blue
sky, okay? If everyone in your community
tells you the red berries in the swamp
are poisonous, that's going to stick. It
might even save your life when you're
out foraging. And if that isn't true, at
least it didn't hurt. The trouble is,
our minds are still inclined to
interpret any repeated phrases as
reality. Like, if you heard something
repeatedly during the Cinon game, even
if it was cruel, even if it was untrue,
it could easily start to feel like a
fact. And if you wanted to question
that, if you confided to a friend that
actually you don't think the game is
helpful, they might respond with the
synonym phrase act as if. Essentially,
this was a cue to pretend you agree with
the cult's rules until one day you
sincerely do. You know that phrase, fake
it till you make it? This was kind of
like Cinanon's version of that. But in
Cinon, act as if was rooted in the
belief that anything invented by Chuck
Dedrich had to be good because he was
supremely wise. Act as if is an example
of a cult language technique called the
thought terminating cliche.
Thought-terminating cliche was coined by
psychiatrist Robert J. Lifton in 1961.
And it describes a kind of zingy stack
expression that's easy to memorize, easy
to repeat, and at its worst is aimed at
shutting down independent thinking,
questioning, or push back.
Thought-terminating cliches combined
with another linguistic strategy to keep
Chuck in power. loaded language, aka
emotionally charged labels and buzzwords
that meant something innocuous or
nothing at all to outsiders, but could
be used on followers to create an us
versus them mentality or even make
psychological threats. Like, does the
term splitty mean anything to you?
Probably not. But in Cinon, that was the
label used to describe those who'd left
the group, the ultimate betrayal and
cardinal sin. Loaded buzzwords like
these are hyper effective because they
jive well with our brains tendency to
form in-groups and outroups. And again,
detecting social patterns like these has
historically been really helpful for
survival. But when a community's aims
are more cerebral than foraging for
food, relying on our crude us versus
them instincts rather than critical
thinking becomes a problem. But to
people in Cinon, this might not have
felt nefarious at all. It may have even
felt fun. In my experience talking to
survivors, cultish language is often the
first thing you pick up when you get
involved with an in-group and the last
thing you let go because it's organic,
invisible, and seemingly
commitment-free. Remember learning pig
Latin on the playground as a kid? It was
like a secret code, and it immediately
made you feel like one of the cool kids,
right?
>> What's that?
>> Well, at least I thought they were cool.
Anyway, pig Latin is pretty far from
synonyon lingo. And so far, you might be
thinking you've been able to escape the
worst of cultish influence. Trust me, I
get it. I'd like to think I have, too.
But it's not just infamous cult leaders
who've caught on to this. In fact, this
kind of manipulative language is sused
into our everyday lives in ways we don't
even notice.
[Music]
Introducing corporate jargon. You might
not work at a company where people walk
around saying things as ridiculous as we
need to leverage our synergies to drive
innovative solutions. Or maybe you do,
in which case, wo. But most companies
have some kind of loaded language used
to motivate people to work hard and help
them feel like they're a part of the
company mission. A business scholar
named Manfred Frqued Devise explained to
me that in the workplace an excess use
of slogans, code words, meaningless
corporate jargon, and company chance can
be a clue in distinguishing if an
employer is treading into dangerously
cultlike territory. In his words, quote,
""All companies have special terms, and
sometimes they make sense, but sometimes
they're nonsense."" As a consultant, I
sometimes enter an organization where
people use acronyms, but they don't
actually know what they're talking
about. They're just imitating what top
management says. A famous example of
this is Amazon, a company whose ideals
take classic American values like
meritocracy, individual ambition, and
climbing ladders, and institutionalizes
them into what I interpret as a
religious dogma of sorts. For example,
Amazon has its own version of the Ten
Commandments, so to speak, called the
leadership principles. They include high
flulutent phrases like think big, dive
deep, have backbone, and deliver
results. According to the New York
Times, Amazon encourages employees to
memorize the principles when they're
hired, then live and breathe them both
in and outside the office, like biblical
proverbs. Some employees even teach them
to their kids. Ex Amazon employee and
writer Christy Coulter once told me that
some employees misinterpret the
leadership principles as a justification
for asserting power over their
co-workers. Like using the disagree and
commit principle as an excuse to pick
fights or tear apart fellow employees
pitches in meetings almost as a stunt to
demonstrate their loyalty to Amazon's
mission. Not terribly unlike the Cinon
game. In a society where work and
consumerism are slowly replacing
classical religious institutions as a
system of belief and belonging, this
kind of language is worth keeping an ear
out for. An even more famous example
comes from the multi-level marketing
industry, aka MLMs. This is Tupperware.
You can freeze it, stack it any which
way.
>> Within pyramid-shaped MLMs, recruits
sell products like leggings or health
supplements to their family and friends,
in turn, luring these people to become
sellers themselves. Recruits are
regarded as business owners, even though
none of the traditional rules of
entrepreneurship apply. MLM acolytes are
labeled consultants or distributors. And
the higher one moves at the structure,
the more grandiose their titles become.
Director, executive, triple ground
diamond, most distinguished mistress of
linguistics.
Yeah, I can see why that's appealing.
What's fascinating about MLMs is that
they're not actually selling financial
independence in any concrete way.
Instead, they're selling something much
more abstract and very American.
Optimism. Faith that you can achieve the
American dream, even if it's numerically
impossible. And that promise is made
with this sparkly language.
Imagine a note like this sliding into
your DMs from an old high school
classmate. Hey, girly pop. Loving your
posts lately. You have such an amazing
energy. Have you ever thought about
turning that energy into your own
business? I used to be miserable at my
old 9 to5 and now I make a full-time
living working part-time for myself from
home without ever having to leave my
little one's side. Would love to grab
coffee and tell you more. Data shows
that since the Tupperware party days,
MLMs tend to target stay-at-home wives
and mothers, as well as other
demographics like college students and
immigrant communities who are generally
locked out of the dignified labor market
and simultaneously seeking purpose. They
also tend to have a strong base of
friends and family to recruit from, lots
of hope for the future, and at least
some spare money and time that they'll
likely never get back. Even beyond work,
similar strategies stretch into our
niche interests, our fandoms. Like,
don't get me wrong, I love T-Swift's Red
Album. But it isn't lost on me that
Swifties have a robust glossery of fan
lingo used to build community around
their parasocial god. References like
Kalor and Gaylers, the numbers 13 and
89, and phrases like not a lot going on
at the moment are used to make fans feel
part of a movement, to give them power,
to show their real devotees above casual
listeners, countless internet
communities, from fantasy sports leagues
to political forums, have loaded
language of their own, too. And while it
can be used to construct a positive
sense of belonging, DFTBA, am I right?
It can also create needless us versus
them conflicts and shut down independent
thought, especially if the people
involved don't quite know why they're
saying these chants and buzzwords that
incite such strong emotions. That
language tobrain connection is powerful.
It can be used to bind someone to an
in-group and make them feel like they
can never leave. It can be used to
confuse a follower so they start to
believe the only way to know what's true
and guarantee their safety is to depend
on the all- knowing leader forever.
[Music]
Okay, so we've talked about what a cult
is, how language is a cult leader's most
powerful and sneakiest tool, and why
modern society is so susceptible to
these strategies. But there's still a
question that haunts me. If cultishness
shows up in the words we use every day,
if we can hear it around us, then how is
it still so effective? Cultish language
can actually be really hard to clock
because it often evolves slowly. For
example, sometimes cult leaders take
existing English words that followers
have been using their whole lives and
gradually twist their meanings until
they have a whole new definition that
serves the cult. I once interviewed a
survivor of the healthy, happy, holy
organization or 3HO, a dogmatic
condundalini yoga based group who told
me that one common English term that
meant something totally different to her
group was old soul. To most of us, old
soul describes someone who's wise beyond
their years. It's a positive thing. But
to a 3o member, the phrase was warped to
mean someone who'd reincarnated life
after life and could never get it right.
It was threatening and it could be used
to frighten followers into obedience
because if you broke one of 3's rules,
like by eating meat or failing to study
scripture at a certain time, you'd be at
risk of lowering your vibration and
becoming an old soul.
In different flavors and with varying
aesthetics, this kind of language is
used to coers people in all destructive
cults. But people don't fall for things
like this because they're foolish. In
large part, it's because cult leaders
are taking advantage of not just the
power of language, but also a handful of
vulnerabilities that have been hardwired
into our heads since the days when we
spent most of our time gathering nuts
and berries. I see it like this. The
brain is like an operating system. Let's
call it OS human. In lots of ways, OS
human is really advanced these days. It
can send a text message and open 250
browser tabs at the same time. Not to
brag, but in other ways, it's the same
basic operating system we've been using
since we started walking upright. For
one thing, OS human has a strong natural
inclination toward communalism, loyalty
to our own group, which we may view as
superior to other groups. And this makes
sense evolutionarily. The famous
biologist Charles Darwin pointed out
that for survival purposes, it's ideal
to have a relatively small community.
Think about it. It's way easier to take
care of a few dozen people than a few
hundred or a few billion. But our world
is much larger now. We're connected to
way more people. And yet, OS human
hasn't completely updated. We still tend
to be fiercely loyal to the insular
groups we're a part of. even if they're
virtual, even if they're not really our
groups in any sense resembling what
Darwin was talking about. And here's the
thing, that OS human source code was
built on some not so reliable
foundations. This is due to cognitive
biases, psychological tricks that
developed in early human brains to help
us make efficient decisions with our
limited time, memory, and brain power.
The illusory truth effect I mentioned
earlier is one of them. Another is
confirmation bias. This is our tendency
to only seek out, notice, and
internalize information that validates
what we already believe. Confirmation
bias can make it hard to accept or even
notice new contradictory information. It
allows us only to hear what we want to
hear. And part of a cult leader's
charisma is their ability to intuitit
this. Like going back to Jonestown, one
survivor named Laura Johnston Cole once
told me I was there for political
reasons. So Jim thought, ""Every time I
see Laura sitting in a meeting, I have
to address politics. I let him address
my priorities and put blinders on for
other things."" This is classic
confirmation bias. One more major flaw
in OS human, the sunk cost fallacy. This
is the belief that if you've already
spent resources on something like money
and time or even hope and secrets, you
can't give that thing up. If you've
already sunk 10 years and your life
savings into a group that promised you
transcendence, you're going to be
heavily motivated to justify your
choices to prove that any day now the
time and hope you put in will pay off.
Sun cost fallacy plus thought
terminating cliche.
Game over.
That's the power of cultish language
over an operating system full of
cognitive biases.
[Music]
So there are all these factors working
against people getting out of cults.
Sometimes it can seem nearly impossible
to escape. But there is reason for hope.
Here's the story of how my dad got out.
When my dad was in high school, he was
in the thick of it. He was surrounded by
friends, family, teachers, doctors.
Everyone around him had so fully
absorbed the language of Cinanon that
there was really no other language
spoken. There was no education except
cult education. Cinanon kids were
required to go to the school on site,
which wasn't teaching multiplication
tables or multiple perspectives. It was
designed to keep them solidly imshed in
Cinanon culture. But Craig was
simultaneously learning to think in a
different way by being exposed to
science. He worked in the group's
microbiology lab where he'd test
followers for diseases because they
wanted to avoid outside hospitals. In a
way, the lab was his sanctuary. It was
the one space in all of Cinanon that was
governed by questions and empirical
facts. It gave him practice thinking
critically and accessing a diversity of
information. And as his interest in
biology grew, he knew he'd need to go to
college if he wanted to continue to
learn. That meant he needed an
accredited degree from an outside high
school. So Craig began hitching rides
into San Francisco to attend one against
tradition and against the urging of
people around him. According to Chuck
Dedrich, Cinanon was utopia and leaving
it was a death sentence. But Craig did
it anyway. And with each passing day,
the world of Cinon felt more contrived
and toxic. Ultimately, when graduation
came, the decision to leave was actually
an easy one. In fact, he was desperate
to go. So, against the pressure of
everyone on the inside, he traded Cinon
for college, just in time to witness its
downfall from afar.
By the late 1970s, Chuck's act as if
protocols became harder to follow as his
dogma grew more and more extreme. For
example, some survivors say when Chuck's
doctor told him he needed to lose
weight, Chuck forced everyone else in
the group to go on strict diets, too,
coercing them to participate in
humiliating mass weigh-ins in the nude.
After Chuck's wife passed away from
cancer and he fell in love with someone
new, he demanded that everyone else go
through the same grief process as a
personal growth exercise and he
separated all the married couples in
Cinanon, then assign them new partners.
That was the last straw for Craig's dad
and stepmother, and they finally left
Cinon in 1977. As time went on, Chuck
also became increasingly paranoid about
outsiders. that inspired him to scrap
one of his original cardinal rules, no
violence. He instituted a personal
militia called the Imperial Marines, who
he mandated to physically beat
Splatizes, the traitorous defectors.
This all culminated in one last act of
violence. Chuck instructed his army to
place a rattlesnake in the mailbox of a
lawyer representing Splatizes. The snake
bit the lawyer, landing him in the
hospital, and Chuck Dedrich was
arrested. Though due to declining
health, he never spent any time in jail.
Cinon disbanded shortly thereafter,
though remnants of the game still live
on in online communities and comment
sections. As for my dad, he must have
had one heck of a college essay because
somehow he got into UC Berkeley,
graduated with a degree in bacteriology,
then moved on to UCLA where he earned
his PhD in microbiology. He went on to
marry a fellow research scientist. Hi,
Mom. And eventually became a professor.
[Music]
So Craig got out, but where does that
leave the rest of us? We're living in an
increasingly complex world teeming with
petty problems, overwhelming choices,
fractured communities, and a constant
onslaught of both true and false
information that our brains simply did
not develop to handle. So, our cognitive
biases sometimes tell us to double down
on cultish choices, to stay with that
candidate a little longer, to try a
final month at that culty fitness studio
to buy one more Stanley Cup. Despite
enormous evidence that we should
reconsider, simply put, our once useful
cognitive shortcuts are clashing with
the modern world. As for why my dad
didn't buy into so many of the cultish
strategies that worked on his peers,
well, in part, he had his interest in
science to think for that. This just
goes to show that even in highly
oppressive environments, a hint of
skepticism can point you toward hope.
But short of running a microbiol,
what are the rest of us supposed to do
about this? What can we take away from
my dad's story as people who are exposed
to cultish language every day? Well, I
argue that being manipulated
isn't always bad. Anything can be taken
too far. But as a whole, just because
something is a little cultish doesn't
mean you have to give it up. Because
here's the thing, human beings influence
each other often times in irrational
ways. It's what we do. We're a social
and mystical species. And cultish
language can be a way to mobilize people
for good. Like one of my best friends
works at a cancer nonprofit and she's
recruited me to do some fundraising for
them. This is an objectively good
mission that I believe in. But vying for
research funding is hard and I've
noticed how the mantras and labels used
within this nonprofit to keep people
inspired can be cultish. Someday is
today. You are the greatest generation
of warriors and heroes in this quest for
a cancer cure. Am I being manipulated
when I hear phrases like that? Totally.
But when it's safe, respectful, and easy
to get out of when you've had enough.
Being a little irrational about the
things we love together, well, that's a
core part of being human. We chant at
sports games, cry shouting the same
phrases over and over again until we
really do believe that our team is
unbeatable. We wear special friendship
bracelets to concerts and flash funny
hand signs at each other to show we
belong to communities we love. Is it all
a little mystical? Sure. But that's how
humans are. And admitting that might
just be the key to making the best of
our cultish proclivities without letting
them take over our lives.
I believe that we can strive to preserve
the sanctity of facts without giving up
the fun of ritual or the might of
cultish language. For example, we can
use what we know about the illusory
truth effect to spread real facts.
Pretty fonts, rhyming slogans, and
constant repetition aren't just for cult
leaders. Memory scientist Lisa Fosio
once told me, ""Remember, it's okay to
repeat true information. People need
reminders of what's true."" Ultimately,
my goal with my writing is to be more
compassionate toward others
irrationalities
and skeptical of my own in this ever
complicated and culty age. I think
that's the best each of us can do. And
with that, I suppose all I can say is
stay curious, stay critical. And dare I
say, amen.

1O2LWteKuRc,"This is Alcatraz Island, the rock, home
to America's most infamous prison. It
long stood as a symbol of confinement
and inescapable fate. But it's also a
place of radical change. The site of
perhaps the most important event in
modern Native American history. More
than a protest, it was a catalyst that
helped bring the relationship between
the American government and Native
nations into a brand new era. One that
we're still feeling the effects of
today. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome to
Crash Course Native American History.
In previous episodes, we covered a lot
of friction between the US government
and Native American peoples. There were
broken treaties and forced removal to
reservations, the attempted elimination
of native cultures through assimulation
and aotment, efforts to repair things
that fell short like the Indian
Reorganization Act of 1934, and then
sweeping reversals of previous
agreements with the termination era.
Things were pretty bad for like
centuries. So by the 1960s, tensions
were high between native nations and the
US government. Native groups like the
American Indian Movement and Red Power
Movement had risen up to try to make
change. Power to the people. And in
November 1969, a group of Native
Americans calling themselves Indians of
all tribes took over and occupied
Alcatraz Island in the San Francisco Bay
for 19 months. That's over a year and a
half. Side note, Alcatraz Island was
originally home to the Muewekma Aloney
tribe for about 10,000 years before the
Spanish discovered it. Richard Oaks, one
of the group's leaders, said in a
statement, ""The choice now lies with the
leaders of the American government. To
use violence upon us, as before, to
remove us from our great spirits land,
or to institute a real change in its
dealing with the American Indian.""
Basically, the ball is in your courts.
And here's the thing, it worked. A year
after the occupation began, then
President Richard Nixon announced plans
for a sweeping new policy for dealing
with native nations. one that would
return power to tribal authorities and
reaffirm native sovereignty.
>> It was time to enter our
self-determination era. This period,
which began in the late60s and continues
to this day, is defined by Native
American activism. Activism pushing for
the honoring of previous treaties, more
autonomy over how we're governed, and
more control over resources on tribal
lands. In other words, activism pushing
for the ability to self-determine. Solid
name. But before we dive into the good
and bad of this new era of federal
Indian policy, let's zoom out a little.
For decades, the US government had
entrusted itself with the welfare of
native nations, a relationship that was
established by treaties and policies and
reinforced by Supreme Court cases. The
bulk of that trust relationship was
maintained by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs or BIA. But many Native nations
had never stopped fighting for their
inherent right to self-govern. And while
protest movements like the occupation of
Alcatraz helped to finally push policy
forward, self-determination had been a
goal of many tribal leaders for years.
Like in the early 60s, the Zonyi nation
of what's now New Mexico found a legal
loophole that allowed them to take more
control over critical community services
typically handled by the BIA. By
replacing federal employees with elected
tribal leaders, the nation gained more
say in its own governance. Nixon
actually pointed to the success of the
Zouri in his speech, calling for
self-determination, saying, quote, ""The
time has now come to build on these
experiences and to extend local Indian
control."" In 1975, Nixon's proposal
became a reality through the Indian
self-determination and education
assistance act. And as of 2024,
self-determination remains the driving
policy behind US tribal relations. We
determine ourselves. Thank you very
much. But what does this actually mean
for Native Americans? Basically,
self-determination allows Native nations
more control over social services like
schools, first responders, and health
care clinics. The federal government
still maintains oversight, and the
process is convoluted to say the least,
but it's no longer fully in charge of
these essential parts of tribal
communities. The federal government is
also required to consult with native
nations anytime they plan to propose a
policy that would directly involve them.
Or take education. For over a hundred
years, the government ran or outsourced
Indian boarding schools that focused
primarily on erasing native culture and
absorbing natives into American culture,
a process called assimilation. This was
often accompanied by physical, sexual,
and emotional violence. There's much
more on this in episode 12. But in the
era of self-determination, most tribes
were able to take over governance of BIA
run schools, radically altering the way
native youth were taught. That meant
ditching the old assimulation tactics
and turning tribalrun schools into
places of community and healing. For
example, in what's now Oklahoma, the
Riverside Indian School once forced
native students to cut their hair and
punish them for speaking their
languages. Today, native students there
are learning about their history and
culture, participating in traditional
dances and songs, and wearing customary
clothing like moccasins and ribbon
dresses. Some of the former students
have even returned to serve as teachers,
helping to undo the harm of the past.
And while the school is still
technically operated by the BIA, thanks
to self-determination laws, its
day-to-day operation is run by local
native administrators and teachers. Core
subjects are also being filtered through
a native lens thanks to this new
structure like using the teachings of
UPIC elders in Alaska. Some schools have
connected their math curriculum to
cultural knowledge by teaching about
geometry using a traditional salmon
rack. By combining culture with context,
students are able to better connect with
abstract mathematical formulas. And many
tribes are finding that teaching in
native languages or using native
cultural touchstones actually reinforces
other areas of learning. At the
Rockpoint chapter of the Navajo
reservation in what's now northern
Arizona, all classes are taught in the
native language of Navajo. Children
learn everything from math to grammar in
the language of their ancestors. It's
part of the recent effort to revitalize
the Navajo language. And not only does
it do wonders for the language itself,
but researchers found that the students
at Rockpoint scored higher in math
compared to kids on other reservations.
They even scored higher in English.
Other steps were taken to protect native
children during this period, too. Like
in 1978, just a few years into the era
of self-determination, Congress passed
the Indian Child Welfare Act. This made
it easier for a native child to be
placed with a relative, tribal foster
agency, or other member of their native
nation. It was passed in response to a
congressional investigation which found
native children were removed from their
homes at much higher rates than
non-native children. Often they were
placed with non-native families in
non-native communities. And arguably,
there's no better resource for native
children than their families and tribes.
Children raised by relatives are far
more likely to live in a stable
environment and more likely to be
employed or in school by age 21 and
they're less likely to be unhoused or
incarcerated. But before you go thinking
that the self-determination era is all
glitter and roses, there have been and
still are issues. Remember during the
previous era of termination, lots of
native nations lost their federal
recognition, which meant the federal
government ended the nationto-nation
relationship they had with those tribes,
which also meant they could no longer
apply for funding and grants through the
new policies. So, not every tribe gets
to experience the positive effects of
self-determination. And then there was
corruption and fiscal mismanagement
within the BIA itself. In the 1980s,
George HW Bush's administration
organized the Special Committee to
Investigate American Indian Affairs. And
in 1989, it released a report that
found, quote, ""Fraud, corruption, and
mismanagement were pervasive within the
BIA as well as within tribal governments
themselves."" In the intervening years,
Congress passed a number of amendments
to the original Indian
self-determination law designed to
address some of these issues. Passed in
1988, one amendment further protected
the ability of tribes to contract and
manage federal programs for themselves
and to use funds as they deemed
necessary. Other later amendments
established tribal self-governance as a
permanent program within the Department
of Interior or DOI and the Department of
Health and Human Services or DHS. These
amendments gave tribal leaders more
oversight in the way funds were actually
being spent on tribal programs, which is
what they should have had all along. So
that brings us to today. It's now been
over 50 years since native activists
sailed into the waters of the San
Francisco Bay and claimed an island
prison as their own. In 2015, one of the
original occupiers, Johnny Barub of the
Cino and Sue Nations spoke at the 45th
anniversary gathering. Alcatraz was the
beginning. It was also giving permission
to everybody in Indian country that it's
okay. You can stand up for your rights.
In the years that followed, plenty of
natives heeded that call, pushing the US
government toward a more just
relationship with native nations. And
that work is ongoing. For example, the
National Association of Food
Distribution Programs on Indian
Reservations consults with the US
Department of Agriculture to advocate
for better access to fresh and
traditional foods. That includes
increasing tribal control to source
healthier options in the food packages
serving native communities. Because
here's the thing. Self-determination
policies have done a lot for Native
nations. They've given us more control
over our tribal governments, allowed us
to provide education to our youth
through cultural contacts, and helped
keep Native children with native
families. But they haven't been a cure
all. There are still unrecognized
treaties, unseated lands, and legacies
of injustice. But the good thing is
there are still people willing to fight
for a better world.
And who knows, maybe in the years to
come, we'll find another path forward
and we'll enter a brand new era. In our
next episode, we're going to explore
some of the ways modern federal Indian
policy impacts natives today. And I'll
see you then. Thanks for watching this

History, which was filmed at our studio

GYw7BrIhWtg,"Things were looking up for the Monomin
tribe of Wisconsin, and that's exactly
what made them a target. It was 1952.
The Monomin had just won a 16-year legal
battle over the US government's
mismanagement of their forest, and they
had been promised $8.5 million. They now
had control over how that forest was
locked. And even though the average
tribal member wasn't well off
financially, the Monomony had a safety
net, but it was about to break. Hi, I'm
Jay Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.

Over the years, the US government's
policies towards Native Nations have
swung between marginally supporting
their right to exist and trying to erase
them. In episode 12, we covered the
allotment and assimilation era when the
US broke up native nations, split their
lands, and tried to make native people
live like white Americans. And in
episode 13, we talked about the
reorganization period when the
government reversed course and tried to
fix the terrible results of those
earlier policies. But by the 1950s, the
pendulum was swinging back the other way
and federal Indian policies were about
to enter a new era, the relocation and
termination era. A period marked by
pushes for new assimilation tactics or
ways to absorb distinct cultures into a
dominant culture. This of course had
happened before and it would happen
again. In the relocation and termination
era, assimilation involved pushing
natives to live and work in cities.
That's the relocation part. At the same
time, the government was terminating its
nation to nation relationship with
tribes. In other words, it no longer
wanted to treat tribes as if they were
their own sovereign nations with their
own governments. And it wanted out of
treaties. That's the termination part.
We're getting to both in detail, but
first I'll set the scene. In the wake of
World War II, a debtstrapped US
government was looking for ways to cut
costs. That meant slashing budgets for
federal programs. And policymakers soon
zeroed in on the Bureau of Indian
Affairs or BIA, the agency that funds
basic services on or near reservations
like schools, roads, and healthcare.
Surely native folks didn't need funding
for all that, right? Except there was a
problem. The federal government had
previously agreed to provide these
services to native nations, agreements
that dated back to treaties they'd
signed in the 19th century in exchange
for native land. That support was
supposed to be permanent. But the
government started to wonder, what if it
wasn't? Hey guys, big idea came to me in
a dream. Okay, listen. What if you all
left reservations? All right, and then
you moved to cities to live like white
people, right? Then then and here's
where it gets good. Then we the
government can then tax and then sell
your land to pay our own bills, right? I
mean, it sounds absolutely incredible.
And oh, listen. I got to go. I got to
put a lot of things in jello. Okay. All
right. You think about it. Let me know
what you think. Okay. Love you. Bye.
Enter the urban Indian Relocation
Program of 1952, which through the BIA
encouraged tribal members to move to
major cities with the promise of good
jobs. housing, education, free pizza.
Okay, maybe not that last part, but you
get the idea. And they offered
government assistance in getting all of
the above, minus the pizza. A few years
later, the Indian Relocation Act even
promised to pay for tribal members
moving cost, job training, and health
insurance if they relocated to cities.
Sounds like a sweet deal, right? But it
also meant Native Americans were leaving
behind their communities and their
cultures. Behind the glossy posters,
relocation looked a lot like
assimilation 2.0. The government hoped
that native people would disappear by
blending into the crowd, and so would
native governments, reservations, the
BIA, and the need to maintain those
pesky treaties. Then in 1953, Congress
passed part two, the Termination Act,
which stated that Native Americans would
be quote subject to the same laws and
entitled to the same privileges and
responsibilities as are applicable to
other citizens of the United States,
which sounds great to some people, even
ahead of its time. But in practice,
freedom meant the end of federally
recognized sovereignty, the right to
self-govern by breaking up native
nations one by one, dissolving
reservations, ending tribal governments,
cutting off federal support. The logic
was that if there is no native nations,
there would be no responsibility to
provide services to them.
Now, some native organizations like the
National Congress of American Indians
saw right through this ruse and fiercely
opposed the new policy. Instead, they
proposed a government assistance program
that could eventually return native
nations to self- sustainability, which
to be clear, native nations were self-
sustainable before colonization, but
after the wreckage we've seen in the
last few episodes, some repair would be
necessary. Unfortunately, despite
widespread media coverage, this plan
never went anywhere. And along with
relocation, termination became the new
dominant federal Indian policy. Which
brings us back to the Monomony, one of
the first native nations to be targeted
for termination. Remember, they were
thriving at the time. Their lumber mill
was profitable. They had successfully
sued the government for over $8 million.
Unfortunately, it was because of this
perceived success that the tribe was
deemed ready to be cut loose. But before
that could happen, the Monominee first
had to agree to it. So in 1954, Senator
Authur V. Watkins of Utah visited the
tribe personally to persuade them. Well,
maybe persuade is the wrong word. It was
more of a bait and switch. See, tribal
members had the opportunity to vote to
get the settlement money they were owed.
And by a show of hands, most people
voted in favor. But Watkins had attached
a provision that was essentially
termination. And once it became clear
that the vote meant the end of their
government and reservation, it was too
late. The actual process of termination
proved to be a difficult and destructive
task. Tribal property was transferred to
a newly created corporation, Monomony
Enterprises, Inc. with tribal members
controlling a small stake in the
company, and the reservation became
Monomin County, which immediately made
it one of the poorest and least
populated in Wisconsin. Things quickly
went from bad to worse. Without federal
funds or a strong tax base to keep the
lights on, the county's only hospital
shut down. Many schools, utilities, and
other basic services deteriorated. The
new white superintendent of the lumber
mill fired about 150 Monomony employees.
Then the mill needed renovations that
the Monomin couldn't afford. It was one
thing after another, and within 7 years,
the newly formed corporation was on the
brink of bankruptcy. Many people sold
their land just to stay afloat. The same
story played out in 1958 with the
termination of 44 tribes in California.
Congress made promise to help those
tribes improve roads, water, and
sanitation before termination became
official. But then it didn't keep those
promises. I'm shocked. Shocked. And the
state of California didn't help either,
reasoning that this was the federal
government's responsibility because,
well, it was. Once again, many tribes
were forced to sell or give up their
lands, like the United Auburn Indian
Community of the Auburn Rancheria. Their
40 acre holding dwindled to just 2.8
acres with a church and a park. All
told, 109 nations were terminated during
the 1950s and60s. This policy wiped away
federal protections for 1.3 million
acres of native land and it cut off
11,000 people or 3% of the American
Indian population from the benefits of
being recognized as citizens of their
nation. No more tribal government, no
more reservations, no more funding for
basic services for their community. And
termination only sped up relocation. As
tribal members relocated to cities,
fewer people were left on the
reservations to fight termination. Then
after termination, tribes had fewer
resources to help their members. So more
people moved to the city to try to make
ends meet. Between 1950 and 1968, more
than 200,000 Native Americans took up
the federal government's offer of a
one-way ticket to a city. Others moved
on their own dime, but often the big
promises didn't pan out. Instead, native
folks commonly found scarce, low-end
jobs, housing discrimination, racism,
social isolation, homesickness.
Many couldn't even afford a ticket back
to the reservation. And for members of
terminated tribes, the reservation no
longer existed. For many, this was
poverty with a change of scenery. We'll
talk much more about relocation and its
long-term effects in a future episode.
But you know what else failed? The plan
to disappear native nations and native
people. We're still here and that's
because of nativeled efforts. The
Monominee weren't done yet. Technically,
when the Monominee were terminated, the
name Monomin Indian Tribe was
terminated, too. But in 1962, they
created a nonprofit organization just to
preserve the name. Monomin Indian Tribe
of Wisconsin Incorporated. Two years
later, nearly 800 Monominees petitioned
President Johnson to repeal termination.
He did nothing. Then in 1970, a group
called Drums, Determination of Rights
and Unity for Monomin Stockholders,
organized to get federal recognition
back. Nobody had ever done that before
until the group's leader, Adah Deer and
James Washington Navatak devoted years
of their lives to making it happen. And
it worked. In 1973, nearly 20 years
after termination, the Monomin tribe of
Wisconsin was restored by an act of
Congress. Deer went on to become the
first woman to lead the Monomonye and
later the first native women to lead the
Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1993, she
said, quote, ""Against all odds,
>> all odds, we invented a new policy,
restoration."" Now, again, I would like
to emphasize this. We, the Monomin,
invented a new policy, restoration.
This is the possibility. This is the
challenge that indigenous peoples in the
hemisphere and across the world can
exert and accept. You don't have to
accept the policies. You can work to
change them.
>> And that work hasn't stopped. For
example, the Clamoth tribe, who lost
federal recognition during the
termination era, got it restored in
1986, though they didn't get back all of
their former reservation lands. And
despite federal termination, other
tribes have gained recognition within
their states, like the Gabina Tongba
Indian tribe, one of two state
recognized tribes in California. Still,
many tribes terminated throughout the
1950s and60s remain without state or
federal recognition in 2025, even though
they fought for decades to get it back.
Though they started as a way to cut cost
for the federal government, relocation
and termination served the same end
goals. blend Native Americans into
mainstream culture, break up Native
nations, cut costs by getting out of the
promises they made to them. They were
new moves from an old playbook.
Relocation separated natives from their
cultures and communities while failing
to uphold the promises of a better life,
and termination was devastating for the
nations affected, leaving scars felt to
this day. And although many native
nations fought hard to get their federal
recognitions restored, many are still
fighting.
Next time, we'll talk about how the
pendulum of federal Indian policy swung
again and the dawn of a new era,
self-determination. And I will see you
then. Thanks for watching this episode

AVAC6WnBSTY,"The land was dying. In the early 1930s,
millions of acres of Navajo land were at
risk of erosion because of overg grazing
by livestock. So, John Collier, the
commissioner of the US Bureau of Indian
Affairs, advocated for its conservation.
Sounds like a solid ally move. Except it
wasn't exactly. In a rush to save the
land and use available government funds,
he forced tribes to dramatically reduce
their herds. In some cases, simply by
slaughtering them and leaving them to
the buzzards. This was a big deal. A
Navo versus livestock was their food,
income, and stability. And now it was
destroyed. So, how can a plan with good
intentions go so arai? Hi, I'm JJ and
welcome to Crash Course Native American
History.
[Music]
In our previous episode, we talked about
what's known as the allotment period,
which started in 1887 with the passing
of the General Allotment Act, aka the
Dolls Act. The law broke up reservations
into smaller chunks of land given to
individual native people. Their stated
intentions were to give natives more
control over their own land and to break
up the tribes in the process. This
legislation had a lot of negative
consequences for native people and by
the 1910s, white folks in government
were starting to take notice. So 40
years after the aotment period began,
Secretary of the Interior Hubert Work
commissioned a report to assess the
situation, putting US census
statistician Lewis Miriam in charge. Now
hold up, this was a huge deal. The US
government had been abusing native
peoples for hundreds of years at this
point. And for the first time, they
openly said, ""We might have done
something wrong."" Which, yeah,
understatement. But still, this was new
for them. In 1928, Miriam presented his
research group's findings from visiting
nearly a 100 Native American
reservations and interviewing about a
thousand Native people. The survey,
which came to be known as the Miriam
Report, was more than 800 pages. That's
like a whole George RR Martin book.
Because it turns out there was a lot to
say. The results were bad. Worse than
12th sequel in a horror franchise bad.
The Dolls Act hadn't made things better
for Native Americans. It had made just
about everything way worse. Take
finances. Instead of making natives more
self-sufficient, a lotment caused a huge
loss of income. In 1920, the average
American was earning about $21,300
annually in today's money. But Native
Americans were living off what today
would just be over $1,500.
And many natives who left their a
lotments to find work in cities found so
little support from white communities
that they ended up living in shanty
towns. And health care for natives had
deteriorated too. For example, the
survey looked at the Canton Insane
Asylum for Indians and found that the
food there was insufficient.
Tuberculosis was spreading and there are
so few trained workers that the people
living there weren't getting the care
they needed. The research team also
found native education to be in dire
straits. Native boarding schools were
overcrowded and harsh punishments were
common there. Native kids were being
forced to do hard labor for hours every
day while being malnourished. Forget
learning, they were suffering.
The Mir report shocked many in power.
So, Congress funneled its
recommendations into new legislation
with the help of well-meaning ally of
Navajo Lifestyle Reduction fame, John
Collier. As commissioner of Indian
affairs under FDR, Cullier held broker
was often called the Indian New Deal and
its centerpiece the Indian
Reorganization Act passed by Congress in
1934. This was huge, bigger than the
Super Bowl, the Aeros Tour and the
finale of the Great British Bakeoff
combined. This was the first piece of
legislation that wasn't aimed at either
assimilating or destroying Native
Americans, but rather helping them.
Major turning point in Native American
history. check. The IRA's purpose was to
throw down an UNO reverse card on the
federal policy that had come before it.
In the text of the law, the government
recognized that tribes are qualified to
exercise powers of self-government, not
by virtue of any delegation of powers
from the federal government, but rather
by reason of their original tribal
sovereignty, which is a lengthy way of
saying tribes can rule themselves, not
because the government says so, but
because tribes say so. After decades of
heavy government control, this was a
major switcheroo for native tribes, and
a good one at that. Along with
reinstating tribal self-governing power,
the IRA encouraged tribes to reorganize
their governments by adopting their own
constitutions and instating tribal
councils to enforce them. The government
also pledged to conserve indigenous
lands and resources, lessen poverty
through a new credit system, and end the
practice of land aotment. Can we make
some noise for the end of another
terrible era?
[Music]
On the surface, this all seemed pretty
great. But here's the tricky part. The
IRA did pass, but only about 40% of
eligible tribal members voted on whether
to adopt it, meaning many tribes
reorganized without all or even most of
their members getting their voices
heard. In the end, 160 plus tribes voted
to reorganize under the IRA and adopted
Americanstyle constitutions, and 77
tribes voted not to reorganize. But why
didn't they want to govern themselves?
To have more agency over their lives and
their lands. Well, think back to the
Navajo. Their pastoral lifestyle had
been all but gutted by the same agency
that was promising them a better future,
even the same guy. Many Navajo weren't
going to trust the people and
institutions that had already hurt them.
And some tribes had too much internal
politics going on to focus on an IRA
vote, while others didn't want to deal
with more meddling from the federal
government. Under the IRA, they'd have
to get government approval for lots of
things, from the wording of their new
constitutions to their spending plans.
But without that strict oversight,
tribes could perform business as usual.
So, what did it look like when a tribe
did reorganize under the IRA? Let me
tell you a story about the Ute tribes of
Colorado.
Collier needed some help persuading the
Southern U and the Ute Mountain tribes
to adopt the IRA. So, he enlisted the
help of Sappia, the chief of the Mohash
band of the Southern Ute tribe to
convince them that the IRA was the way
to go. Sappia was the poster child for
the IRA's potential. He was a successful
farmer and leader, and he managed to
sway both tribes, or at least a few
people who voted, to adopt the IRA. But
he kept the secret to his financial
success to himself. Preferential
treatment from the government agencies.
Conveniently left that part out.
Hosapia. At first, things looked good
for the Colorado youth. They were able
to buy back 220,000 acres of their land
that had been sold to non-natives. And
not just any land. Land with coal, gas,
and oil deposits. Hello, land leases.
Hello, moola. Their communities were
bouncing back. But something strange
happened. The youths started to lose
their culture. Think fewer tepeees, more
picket fences, less traditional
clothing, more jeans and cowboy boots.
Fewer youth language speakers, more I
only know English speakers. And losing
your culture is no laughing matter. The
disorientation many youths felt led to
rising alcoholism and depression. So
things were on the up and up, but at
what cost? And that's the story of the
Colorado Youths and the IRA.
[Music]
Many natives saw the changing
governmental structures imposed by the
IRA to be another kind of assimilation,
a process where a minority group's
culture gets absorbed or erased into a
more dominant culture. Written
constitutions and hierarchical
governments allow the founding fathers
didn't gel with the ways that tribal
governments had historically functioned
like the Ojiway tribe had previously
operated through consensus where
representatives from all villages had to
agree before a measure was taken. But
under the IRA things had to move more
quickly to use funds before they laped
for example and the majority ruled. On
top of that, many native folks called
the IRA the Indian RAW deal. For the way
it kept a lot of power in the hands of
the US government. New constitutions
would require most actions the tribe
took to be approved by the Secretary of
the Interior and or the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs and tribal councils had
to adhere to the whims of the BIA whose
leadership could change each election.
But that's not all. The programs created
by the IRA were also severely
underfunded. And despite promises of
restoring land, or at least paying for
what had already been stolen, the
federal government brought back only 2
million of the 90 million acres of land
lost to European settlers and businesses
during the allotment era. While land
could no longer be taken by force from
tribes, and the IRA added millions of
acres to existing reservations, natives
were still only given a small fraction
of what they were owed. Maybe the main
issue though was that the IRA was a
single piece of legislation that was
supposed to fix a whole host of
different problems in really different
tribes. Hundreds of years of broken
treaties, land grabs, and punishing
legislation took too high of a toll to
be fixed by one law. But hey, it was
Congress's first shot at rectifying
those centuries of harms against Native
Americans. No one gets it perfect right
off the bat. You got to start an ongoing
process of change, right? Right. Except
here's the thing. Even with all the
other legislation that had been created
in the past century, the IRA is still in
place. Let that sink in for a second.
The first attempt made in 1934 is still
the law of the land with all of its
flaws and shortcomings. So where does
that leave tribes today? In a lot of
different places. The IRA still holds up
its end of the bargain in some ways,
like through providing funding and
financial assistance and by supporting
some native land use, even for a handful
of tribes that didn't organize under the
IRA back in the 30s. Which brings us
back to the youths and the Navajo. The
youths, who had lost some of their
culture as a result of this policy, have
been making strides to preserve it,
establishing Ute Mountain ute tribal
park, the Ute language project, and
small bison herds on their reservations.
And the Navajo, whose hurd were
decimated to prevent erosion and voted
not to adopt the IRA, are still debating
the structure of their tribal
government. Should it be locally focused
or more centralized? Should they adopt a
constitution or keep operating without
one? The project of native government is
never really over. 90 years later,
Native Americans still debate whether
the IRA was a success or a failure, and
there are arguments that could be made
for both. But perhaps the reason it's
fallen short of its promise is that the
promise was too big to be tackled in one
go. Still, the IRA shows us how the
process of repairing a relationship
marred by hundreds of years of
generational trauma can begin. Notice a
problem, observe and talk to folks who
are dealing with it, and bring that
knowledge onto actionable change. It's
tough, and it won't be perfect, but it's
a start. In our next episode, we're
going to discuss Native American
Relocation and Tribal Termination, and I
will see you then. Thanks for watching

It's 1883. After generations of broken
treaties, wars, and forced removal,
things are as bad as they've ever been
for Native Americans. And white
progressives calling themselves friends
of the Indian are meeting to talk about
how to make things right. At first, the
friends talk about things like honoring
treaties and restoring stolen land. But
within a few years, they've pivoted.
What if Native Americans just lived like
settlers? As bad as things already were,
they were about to get a whole lot
worse. See, for about a hundred years,
the US government had used a whole bag
of tricks to deal with the fact that
native people a existed and b controlled
lands that settlers wanted. This was a
so-called Indian problem, which isn't a
joke. That's literally what they called
it. But by the late 19th century, the
government had exhausted most of its
playbook. Sign treaties with native
nations as equals, check. Break those
treaties, check. Wage war, check. Remove
tribes onto reservations. Check. In
short, they had tried everything to
solve the Indian problem. Well, almost
everything. There's still one more play.
A real Hail Mary. What if they turn
Native Americans into white Americans?
You know the old saying, if you can't
beat them, make them join you. So,
that's when Friends of the Indian began
talking about assimilation, absorting
natives into American culture.
Conveniently, it suited the US
government's goals. If native people
lived and thought just like settlers,
there would be no problem with using the
land for all it was worth. And as the
idea caught on, some people saw it as a
way to help natives by quote civilizing
them. Richard Henry Pratt put it this
way. Kill the Indian, save the man.
Pratt was a US Army officer who first
started erasing native identity by
forcing native prisoners of war to cut
their hair, wear uniforms, and give up
everything from their culture. When he
later founded the Carile Indian
Industrial School in 1879, he used the
same methods on native children.
Carlo was the first federallyun
off-reservation boarding school for
natives. And between the late 19th and
early 20th centuries, it became the
model for dozens of other boarding
schools supported by the US government.
Thousands of native children were taken
from their families, brought to schools
hundreds of miles from home and forced
to give up everything from their
cultures, their clothing, their
languages, their religion, even their
names. Those who define the rules were
beaten. Many suffered malnutrition,
disease, and abuse.
Luther Standing Bear in Ogla Lakota who
attended Carlile remembers, ""We went to
school to copy, to imitate, not to
exchange languages and ideas, and not to
develop the best traits that had come
out of uncountable experiences of
hundreds and thousands of years living
upon this continent. Hundreds of native
children died at these schools, and the
ones who made it out would return to the
homes and cultures they no longer felt
connected to.
A few native parents willingly enrolled
their kids, hoping for the best. But
many were forced. Some schools even
required that parents give up custody
entirely. There was resistance, of
course, like the 19 Hobie men who were
incarcerated at Fort Alcatraz in 1894
for refusing to send their kids to
boarding schools. Plenty of others spoke
out against the harms of boarding
school, like the Yankton Sue writer Zin
Kaliska, who shared her experiences
working as a music teacher at Carlilele.
In the Atlantic, she wrote, ""Gazing upon
the Indian girls and boys bending over
their books, the white visitors walked
out of the schoolhouse wells satisfied.
They were educating the children of the
red man. But few had paused to question
whether real life or long-lasting death
lies beneath the semblance of
civilization."" Pratt dismissed her
writing as trash and fired her for
speaking out. Despite all this effort,
boarding school still had a problem.
They only assimilated kids. What about
the adults? Senator Henry Dolls, a
member of the Friends of the Indian, had
an answer. He believed that the key to
assimilation lay in land ownership. If
the government could control which
natives owned what land and how that
land was used, then assimilation would
finally be locked in. So in 1887, Dolls
and another friend of the Indian,
anthropologist Alice Cunningham
Fletcher, co-drafted the General
Allotment Act, aka the Dolls Act. It
authorized the president to chop up
reservations into parcels up to 160
acres called aotments that were given to
individual tribal members. Instead of a
big chunk of land shared by the whole
tribe, each member would get a small
slice that belongs just to them. It's
giving grift aotment was supposed to be
the government's golden ticket, a fast
track to assimilation. It would split up
tribes and open up more land to
settlers. Native men would farm. Native
women would keep the house. And the
Indian problem would finally go away for
good. And to sweeten the deal, US
citizenship for anyone who accepts an
aotment and relinquishes tribal
citizenship. No need to identify with a
tribe when you're a citizen of the good
old US of A. Allotment wasn't a new
assimilation technique, though. In fact,
it had already happened to the Omaha
nation by the time the Dolls Act was
signed. Just a year before their
reservation was broken up, the Omaha's
principal chief Angonga aka Big Elk
wrote to his people, quote, ""I bring you
news which it saddens my heart to think
of. There is a coming flood which will
soon reach us, and I advise you to
prepare for it."" He had foreseen not
just a collapse of the Omaha way of
life, but a disaster that would wipe
away native identity everywhere. As the
government forced aotments onto tribes
across the country, Big Elk's vision
became a reality. Some tribes resisted
at first. The Yankton Sue, for example,
knew their land wasn't good for crops
and wanted to keep it all for communal
grazing. But federal officials use
military force to persuade members of
the tribe to take aotments. Many tribal
leaders feared they'd just lose more of
their land to settlers after the Dolls
Act. And they were right. The government
marked any non-allotted land as surplus
to Indian needs and open it up for
non-native settlers to purchase. Before
the doll's act, native nations
controlled 138 million acres of land. By
the time aotment ended in 1934, they'd
lost 2thirds of that acreage. The doll's
act also led to the creation of tribal
roles, list of every member of a tribe.
The roles came with their own problems,
including the creation of blood quantum,
a way of measuring tribal membership by
fraction of tribal blood, which was
basically just an unscientific vibe
check based on whether someone looked
native. You can learn a lot more about
that in episode 4. Tribal members
assumed to be mixed race were assigned
lower blood quantum and given US
citizenship and full control of their
aotment right away. But those assigned a
higher blood quantum were presumed to be
incompetent because they had no European
blood. Basically, they weren't white
enough. They were given a 25-year
waiting period before they could take
full control. And when they finally
received the complete title to their
allotment, many had to turn around and
sell it because they couldn't afford to
pay the property taxes. Yeah, big grift
vibes from the dolls act. Thanks to the
practice of aotment, many reservations
today are a checkerboard of mixed
ownership. Parcels owned by the tribe
and tribal members are all jumbled
together with parcels that aren't. For
example, the Nez Purse reservation
stretches across 785,000
acres, but only 13% of it is owned by
the tribe or tribal members, which makes
it hard to do anything that requires
large connected chunks of land like
farming and ranching or for tribes to
carry out traditional activities. The
effects of assimilation and aotment
can't be understated, and they're still
being felt generations later. Aotment
left a legacy of land ownership that was
at best fractured. After the death of
those natives who could pay the property
taxes, ownership was split up among
their kids and their kids' kids and
their kids' kids' kids and so on. So
today, many aotments have hundreds of
owners and the legacy of boarding
schools is still being reckoned with.
Dr. Denise Lashadier, a poet and
enrolled citizen of the Turtle Mountain
Band of Chipoa, called the policies of
that era cultural genocide. Many of her
relatives, including her parents, spent
time in boarding schools. She wrote
about their experiences, saying,
""Speaking their tribal language was
forbidden. My father talked about li
soap being put in mouths, which caused
painful blisters, and pins put through
tongues."" But there is healing to be
found. Survivors of boarding schools
have told lies that language is medicine
and culture is treatment. The more these
practices are revived, the more healing
can happen. And those efforts are
underway across tribal nations. Like in
recent decades, many native nations have
begun to teach their traditional
languages within tribalrun school
systems, a far cry from the boarding
school era. We'll talk much more about
these efforts in a later episode. By the
late 19th century, native nations had
already seen generations of bad deals,
broken promises, and loss of land and
life. And in the era of assimilation and
aotment, greed came disguised as a
helping hand. Be like us, dress like us,
work like us, speak like us, worship
like us, and then things will be better.
Despite native resistance, these
policies brought catastrophic losses of
culture and land, leaving scars that are
still felt generations later.
But today, tribes are fighting to
reclaim their cultural identities,
revive their languages, and heal
generations of trauma.
Next time, we'll talk about what
happened in 1934 when the US government
tried to put power back in the trib's
hand. And I will see you then. Thanks

VyF8SOSP2YM,"In 1973, 200 indigenous protesters
staged an armed takeover of Wounded
Knee, where the US military had
massacred 300 Lakota less than a hundred
years earlier. They held the site for 71
days, exchanging gunfire with federal
authorities, who later admitting to
firing over half a million rounds at
tribal members, killing two native men.
And while most remembered the occupation
for its violence, the protesters also
held ceremonial dances, songs, and
prayers and gained a lot of attention
for their cause. But what were they
fighting for? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and
welcome to Crash Course Native American
History.
[Music]
The occupation of Wounded Knee was
broadly about treaties, formal
agreements, usually between two or more
states or nations. Many of the
protesters were members of the American
Indian Movement, which among other
things fought for the US government to
honor its treaty obligations with native
nations. See, between the mid 18th and
mid-1 19th centuries, a period called
the treaty era, the US entered into
nearly 400 treaties with Indian nations.
And it wasn't a fun Taylor Swift kind of
era. Most tribes were coerced into
signing these treaties. And the few that
entered willingly often did so without
full understanding of their meaning.
Treaties change tribal borders in major
ways during this period. and played a
huge part in removing Native Americans
from their lands as colonists pushed
westward. And when treaties didn't work
in their favor, the US government often
just disregarded them. And trust me,
they ignored a lot. During this period,
we also saw the formation and scaling up
of reservations. These were specific
portions of lands that the US government
allocated to tribes, often forcing them
to move there. We call the period
between 1850 and 1887 the reservation
area. But to understand how we ever got
here to this point and to the occupation
a hundred years later, we have to look
backwards. So, I'm going to walk you
through that hundredish year timeline,
which means I'm about to cover a lot of
history in a short amount of time. Think
of this as a primer, a little appetizer.
Don't make me say it crash course. So,
when you finish this video, you might
want to dig deeper. Actually, you should
want to dig a little deeper.
you will dig deeper.
>> Let's start back in the olden times,
1626, when the indigenous Lape people of
what's now New York, sold the island of
Manhattan, then called Manahhata, to the
Dutch for $24 worth of beads and other
trinkets. Or at least that's probably
the story you heard. It's been retold in
textbooks and paintings, and it's even
been cited as one of the foundational
myths of New York City. I hear it's
engraved on the Statue of Liberty right
under I'm walking here. But this story
has likely been exaggerated. Our records
of the deal come from the writings of
one lone Dutch dude who wasn't even
there when it happened. The fact is it's
possible that a band of Lape did sell
the island to the Dutch for about
$1,000. But the terms of the agreement
were influenced by each party having
very different worldviews. The Dutch,
like most Europeans, thought of land
ownership as something tangible and
permanent. But many native nations,
including some clans among the Lape, had
a very different viewpoint. In their
culture, land was controlled by the
community and divided for use among
extended family, which was different
from the individual system of ownership
Europeans were used to. Anyway, the Lape
likely believed that they were renting
or leasing the land, not selling it
outright. Joanna Gorlick from the Museum
of the American Indian put it this way.
I don't think the exchange itself is in
question. I think the meaning of that
exchange is in question. This is just
one early example, but these cultural
misunderstandings and some intentionally
fine print would play a large role in
the treaty era. As more and more
colonists came to the so-called new
world, they pushed Native Americans
westward, often violently, and tribes
would understandably retaliate against
the colonists who used their land and
stole their resources. But during and
after the American Revolution,
especially when the Young Republic was
weakened by its war with Britain, the
threat of conflict with Native Americans
was threatening. So many treaties at
this time were focused on peace and
friendship in exchange for land. In
fact, the very first treaty called the
Treaty with the Delawares was signed
during the revolution in 1778 between
the newly formed United States and the
Lape who the Americans called the
Delaware. It promised sovereignty and
statehood in exchange for, among other
things, letting American troops pass
through their land unscathed during
battles with the Brits. But although the
Lape held up their end of the bargain,
the US failed to deliver on theirs. This
pattern would unfortunately repeat
itself many times over. In the words of
Lakota leader Redcloud, they made us
many promises, more than I can remember,
but they never kept but one. They
promised to take our land, and they took
it. As the US continued to grow, these
treaties became less about keeping the
peace and more explicitly about gaining
territory. Some tribes signed away their
lands either willingly or unwillingly,
but many resisted, including the
Cherokee, Creek, Chalkaw, Chickasaw, and
Seol nations in the southeast. In this
region, colonists saw the tribes as a
roadblock to fertile land for growing
cotton.
In 1814, future President Andrew
Jackson, then a major general in the
army, led a push against the Creek
Nation. It came to a head in the Battle
of Horseshoe Ben near what's now the
Georgia Alabama border. Many of the
Creek were massacred, and the remaining
were forced to sign a treaty that seated
over 20 million acres to the US, which
was a wake-up call for many tribes.
Realizing it would be nearly impossible
to defeat the Americans in battle, many
chose to sign treaties that gave up much
of their land in the hopes that they
would at least get to keep some of it.
But in 1830, a year after Jackson was
elected president, Congress passed the
Indian Removal Act, which gave the US
government sweeping power to grant land
west of the Mississippi River to any
native nation that agreed to give up
their land in the east. These treaties
were officially considered voluntary,
but in practice that was far from the
truth as bribery and threats were
commonplace. Consider the treaty of
Newota, which Jackson signed with the
backing of a single Cherokee chief who
represented barely a fraction of the
tribe. It gave the US 7 million acres of
land in exchange for just $5 million.
Unsurprisingly, many Cherokee didn't
want to leave their ancestral homeland.
So, under the leadership of principal
Chief John Ross, they held out against
removal. Ross and his supporters argued
the treaty was a fraud and worked to
convince the government to recognize the
older treaties it had signed,
guaranteeing the Cherokee the land they
were already on. Ultimately though, the
resistance broke down in 1838 when the
remaining Cherokee were finally removed
at gunpoint by the army and members of
the Georgia militia. From there, Ross
led his people westward as part of what
would become known as the Trail of
Tears.
All told, during the 1830s, an estimated
100,000 Native American people were
forced to leave their homes and journey
thousands of miles west, and around
15,000 individuals died along the way.
But it didn't end there. As the US
continued to expand westward, the
government began re-encountering the
same peoples they had driven from the
east a few decades earlier, not to
mention those western tribes who had
already lived there. I mean, what did
they expect? But this time, the
government took a different approach.
What if instead of signing a bunch of
treaties, they just reserved a small
piece of land for tribes to live on? It
had been done before with some success
in 1786 when the United States
established its first reservation. So,
in 1851, Congress passed the
Appropriation Bill for Indian Affairs,
which allocated funds to build a more
robust reservation system, kicking off
the reservation era. Over the next 30
something years, most Native Americans
were either forcibly relocated or saw
their land dramatically reduced. And in
1871, Congress officially took away the
right of native nations to enter into
treaties with the United States
government. It was an unceremonious
amendment attached to an appropriations
act passed without the input of any
tribal members, and it was officially
the end of the treaty era. But what did
this mean for the nearly 400 treaties
that had been made in the last century?
Technically, they remained intact, but
this decision made it even harder for
them to be enforced, which brings us
back to Wounded Knee. See, in 1868, the
Lakota Sue signed a treaty with the US
that established a great Sue reservation
on 60 million acres of land. But not
long after, the US government discovered
a lot of natural resources on that land
and decided to do some classic takes
back seis. By the end of the reservation
era, only about 20% of the original
reservation remained with the rest back
in the hands of the federal government.
On top of that, reservation life was
difficult for the Lakota. Drought
combined with a lotments that were bad
for sustainable crop growth made farming
difficult. And both a near extinction of
the buffalo population and rules against
hunting on reservation land made their
traditional way of life nearly
impossible to sustain. So they had no
choice but to rely on government
rations. They were also disconnected
from their culture and identity, forced
to wear western clothing and abandoned
their traditional spiritual practices in
favor of Christianity. We're talk more
about life on reservations in a future
episode. By 1890, after a series of
conflicts in the murder of Lakota Chief
Sittingbull, tensions between the tribe
and the government had reached a
breaking point. US forces surrounded a
mini Konju Lakota camp near Wounded Knee
Creek where after a gun went off
accidentally, the military massacred
upwards of 300 Lakota men, women, and
children.
83 years later, the occupation of
Wounded Knee brought this massacre back
into the public eye. Many scholars point
to the occupation as the spark that
kicked off a massive push for
recognition of native treaty rights all
across the country. After all, those
hundreds of treaties are still the law
of their land, whether or not they're
honored. So, invoking them had become a
major strategy for native nations to
push for the return of their lands. And
since the occupation, a number of them
have used historic treaties to fight for
and achieve legal wins. I know all this
can feel like the distant past, but it's
not. Babies born on the day of the
Wounded Knee Massacre would have been in
their early 80s during the occupation.
And occupiers from 1973 joined protests
at Stand Iraq to object to Dakota Access
Pipeline in 2016.
The point is the fight for treaty
recognition continues right here, right
now. Native leaders and activists
continue to push the federal government
to honor its promises and momentum only
continues to build as new generations
join the fight.
Next time we'll talk about Native
American assimilation and the aotment
era and I will see you then. Thanks for

IIJwt3zO4fw,"Okay, so let me tell you about
Christopher Columbus.
So I've been told you can't say any of
that on YouTube. So let's start here
with the Tyeno people. They're one of
the first tribes to encounter Columbus
in what's now the Dominican Republic in
Haiti. Some scholars estimate that there
may have been more than 3 million Tyenos
in Hispanola when Columbus came ashore,
but within a century they were declared
extinct. A whole people gone. except
they're very much still here.
This historical inaccuracy isn't the
only one in the story of the so-called
New World. Far from it. Hi, I'm Jim and
welcome to Crash Course Native American
history.
[Music]
Today we're talking about the first
contact between Native Americans and
European colonists. The story that's
often told through this little diddy
about 1492, the ocean blue, and you know
who. First contact is a phrase used to
describe the first meeting between two
communities. And to say that there are a
lot of misconceptions around the first
contact between Native Americans and
Europeans would be like saying Messi is
good at soccer. Major understatement.
You can feel the Ninia, the PA, and the
Santa Maria with all that
misinformation. So, let's start off with
a quick fact check. The only thing
Columbus set out to discover was a
better way to get from Spain to Asia.
The trade route known as the Silk Road
was something of a shle between Europe
and Central Asia, and the Ottoman Empire
shut it down in 1453, prompting the
so-called Age of Discovery. So, Columbus
proposed a mathematically incorrect plan
to sail west across the Atlantic. He got
funding from the king and queen of
Spain, Ferdinand and Isabella, who were
pretty psyched for all the potential
riches and the opportunity to spread
Catholicism around the globe. Columbus
and his crew made landfall in 1492 in
what's now the Bahamas and he claimed
for Spain what he believed to be India.
Big colonizer energy. The Bahamas were
home to the Lucayans, a branch of the
Arawak tribe. Columbus immediately took
six Lucayans as slaves or servants in
his words. So yeah, we got some serious
myth busting to do.
[Music]
In the Americas, the idea of first
contact is described like this. Columbus
shows up in the Bahamas and boom,
Europeans have met Native Americans. But
because neither Europeans nor Native
Americans are just one thing, Columbus
was only the first contact between the
Spanish Empire and the Lucayans. There
were countless initial means between
Europeans and Native Americans both
before and after Columbus got lost.
Like there's evidence that more than 500
years before Columbus, the Scandinavian
Vikings came to Greenland where they
encountered the native Tuli people. And
there were first contacts in Alaska and
Hawaii, too, which we'll get into at a
later episode. First contacts between
different Europeans and native nations
continued occurring all the way through
the 1800s. The first encounter the
sailors had with non-natives wasn't
until 1805 when the Louiswis and Clark
expedition wandered into their territory
in Montana looking for horses and
directions. So first contact is kind of
a misnomer as is the idea of discovery.
I mean Columbus has been celebrated for
centuries for discovering a continent
that millions of people already lived
on.
Fresh untamed wilderness.
I shall call it Hey. Hey buddy. We're
kind of filming here. This is our
studio.
>> Studopous.
A name that just came to me in a divine
vision with no outside influence.
>> Again, already here. But you know what?
Never mind. I'm going to get a holiday
named after me for this one. Someone
tell the Pope.
So, if you've ever wondered how
colonizers got away with just showing up
to someone's home or studio and claiming
it as their own, you can thank the
popes. In 1493, Pope Alexander V 6th
made a decree, also known as the Papal
Bull, that any land not inhabited by
Christians could be discovered and
claimed by Christian rulers. Interetra
was the third in a trilogy of paple
bulls that made up what's called the
doctrine of discovery. And this became
the legal basis for Europeans claims
over indigenous lands and later
Americans justification for westward
expansion. You know the old saying,
paper bulls gives you wings. The point
is this defense held up in court as
recently as
2005 and its impacts had been felt by
indigenous peoples all over the world
for centuries. We'll circle back to
sketchy land grabs in a bit. But
regardless of first, second, and
thousandth contact, one thing's for
sure, European arrival was catastrophic
for Native American populations. While
exact numbers are hard to pin down
because of fragmented historical
evidence, the overall population may
have been decreased by as much as 90%.
And you can bet that there's a detail or
two missing from that chapter of the
history books.
A lot of that population decline I
mentioned gets blamed not on the
colonizers themselves, but on the
diseases that they carried, which led to
major outbreaks. Historians sometimes
call these outbreaks virgin soil
epidemics because diseases like measles
and smallox were new to Native American
populations. So, their immune systems
hadn't built up any resistance to them,
which made the diseases incredibly
deadly and widespread. And while it is
true that epidemics killed many people,
the whole truth isn't quite so
straightforward. Research shows that it
was disease in combination with all the
other fallout from European
colonization, including but not limited
to war, enslavement, and starvation that
made Native Americans especially
vulnerable. And this nuance is important
because if you focus primarily on
disease, it obscures the truth that
colonizers purposely killed millions of
people and harmed many more.
Now, just a warning. I'm about to get
into an example of genocide. This is
some heavy history, and it's important
to take care. In 1848, the discovery of
gold in California incited a rush of
settlers who engaged in what was
literally called Indian hunting. This
practice was not only legal, but
encouraged. In 1851, Governor Peter
Bernett declared that a war of
extermination will continue to be waged
between the races until the Indian race
becomes extinct. State and federal
governments spent nearly $2 million on
what's referred to today as the
California genocide. In all, the native
population of California dropped from
around $350,000
at first contact to about 18,000 by
1880. And that was very much
intentional. This is hard history to
tell just right because when we focus on
all the horrible things that have
happened to native peoples, it can
create the impression that we were
passive throughout it, that we were and
are victims, when in reality, we're so
much more than that. For starters, not
all interactions between Native
Americans and Europeans were the same.
Cooperation and exchange did happen. And
I'm not just talking about the Wampaog
teaching the pilgrims how to grow corn.
In many cases, Native American tribes
dealt with Europeans using diplomacy or
trade and created strategic alliances
that gave them advantages over other
native nations. For instance, tribes
such as the Aangquins, the Inu, and the
Windot allied with the French, and many
traded furs for valuable European
imports such as guns. But unlike French
fur traders, British colonists were more
likely to demand control over native
people and their land, which led to some
major conflicts.
Sometimes tribes join forces to fight
off an invasion, like in the case of
Pontiac's rebellion, named for the
Ottawa chief who coordinated a bunch of
tribes across the Ohio River Valley and
the Great Lakes region to try to oust
the British. In response to the
uprising, King George III signed a
proclamation of 1763, drawing a boundary
around indigenous lands that European
settlers couldn't cross. And then you've
got one of the most famous military
victories for Native Americans, the
Battle of the Little Bigghorn.
In 1875, the US government was trying to
force the Lakota Sue onto reservations,
and they pushed even harder when gold
was discovered in the South Dakota Black
Hills, which are sacred to them. When
the tribe refused to sell, the US tossed
a former treaty to the wind and sent in
last Kuster and his calvary, who were
met with a prompt defeat.
The story doesn't end there. The US
retaliated by illegally seizing the
Black Hills 2 years later, and now they
look like this.
But the story doesn't end there, either.
In 1980, the Supreme Court ruled that
the land had been wrongfully taken and
awarded the Sue Nation $12 million as
compensation. $12 million. Those were
some fat stacks. But the Lakota Sue
pulled a baller move when faced with
that offer. They said, ""No, we are
nothing without the Black Hills."" Chi
chang historian Nick Estus said in a
documentary on the subject. That's why
the Black Hills are not for sale because
we are not for sale.
Mic drop. Native resistance continues
today. And sometimes that looks like
riding the historical record.
Remember when I said that the Tyino
population was devastated by Spanish
colonization? They were labeled extinct
soon after a 1565 census listed only 200
naves living on Hispanola. But that
doesn't tell the whole story. In 1533,
the Spanish had freed enslaved native
people, but not enslaved Africans. So to
keep their enslaved workers, many
Spanish colonizers reclassified Tyenos
as Africans. Nice loophole, guys. And in
the early 1800s, the Spanish changed
their census categories so that Puerto
Ricans could identify themselves only as
white or non-white. Tinyos themselves
didn't disappear. Their label did. A
label that was created by colonizers.
[Music]
Nevertheless, Tino culture persisted for
centuries in passed down stories and
traditions like baking cassav, a type of
yuca bread. And after decades of
research, a major shakeup happened in
the early 2000s when a study out of the
University of Puerto Rico revealed that
23 to 30% of Dominicans, 33% of Cubans,
and 61% of Puerto Ricans had indigenous
genes. The research confirmed what Tino
people already knew, that they're still
here, despite the efforts of what they
call a paper genocide, meaning a sort of
erasure from history through what might
otherwise seem like boring old
paperwork. Fortunately, by the 2010
census, Puerto Ricans could label
themselves as American Indian or Alaskan
Native, and awareness for Tino ancestry
continues to grow. In 2016, a group of
researchers from across Europe, the US,
and Mexico was able to sequence and
analyze ancient Tino DNA from a
thousand-year-old tooth found on the
island of Alra in the Bahamas. It showed
even stronger evidence of a continued
indigenous presence in the Caribbean,
especially in Puerto Rico, which is so
cool. It makes me think about how
important the stories we tell are to
understanding ourselves and our history.
All this goes to show just how wrong the
idea of a single first contact between
Europeans and Native Americans really
is. Instead, there were hundreds of
contacts across hundreds of years that
reshaped the land we now call the US and
the people on it.
But that reshaping isn't over. Next time
we'll talk about treaties and how Native
have been using them to get their land
back. And I will see you then. Thanks

9Gmncfkeh7E,"On a dark winter night in 1945, a shout
rang out on the banks of the Nusquali
River. You're under arrest. Billy Frank
Jr., just 14 at the time, called back,
""Leave me alone. I live here."" before
being hauled off to a holding cell. He
didn't know it then, but his arrest was
one of the earliest battles in what
would later be known as the Fish Wars.
Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.
[Music]
That night on the river, Frank Jr. was
checking his fishing nets just like his
ancestors had done for generations. He
was a member of the Nusquali Nation, one
of many in the Pacific Northwest that
fished the rivers there for ages.
It was his first time being arrested,
but it wouldn't be the last. In the
years to come, he'd be handcuffed at
least 50 more times, threatened, and
harassed too many times to count. and
he'd inspired dozens of others to join
him in his nonviolent resistance. See,
for native people, the food you eat
defines who you are and not in a health
consscious you are what you eat kind of
way. Frank Jr. and other members of the
Nusquali had a strong connection to the
fish they ate. For them, salmon were
gifts from the creator to be honored and
protected, even if that meant facing
jail time.
[Music]
But to understand how it ever came to
that, let's take a step back. In episode
two, we talked about sovereignty, the
right of native nations to govern
themselves. Today, we're going to talk
about a different kind of
self-governance, food sovereignty. The
right of native nations to use the foods
that have sustained their communities
since time in memorial. Before Europeans
arrived, natives from coast to coast had
their own distinct culturally defined
behaviors, beliefs, and attitudes
surrounding their traditional foods.
Their menus were local and seasonal,
rotating among hundreds of different
kinds of plants and animals. Like the
Elgangquin tribes knew June as the
strawberry moon, the month that marks
the beginning of berry season. And the
Shauni knew September as the paw pa
moon, the month when you can enjoy an
enormous custody fruit that's like the
mango of the Midwest. Native peoples
also stockpiled certain foods to enjoy
year round. like many in what's now
California created a flower out of raw
acorns by drying, shelling, smashing,
and flushing out their bitterness. Then
they' use it to whip up a batch of soup,
bread, or mush. Other native nations
like the whole Neoni and Cherokee
depended on corn grown either on its own
or closely planted with beans and
squash. They knew these crops as the
three sisters because like family, they
protected each other and grew better
together. Unlike the two brothers,
orange juice and toothpaste, which are
sworn enemies. But all that changed when
Europeans began colonizing the land we
now call the United States. In just over
300 years, native nations across the
country lost 99%
of the lands where they hunted, fish,
gathered, and grown food for longer than
anyone can remember. And between the
19th and 20th centuries, as the US
government forced native people off
their lands, they used federal boarding
schools to eradicate their cultures
altogether. Native children were
separated from their families, their
languages, their traditions, and their
foods. Students in boarding schools were
often fed lowquality rations and
punished if they ate anything they'
personally grown while laboring on the
school farms. At the same time that
native people were being separated from
their traditional foods, settlers were
exploiting those food sources in
unsustainable ways. Like traditionally
the great Sue called themselves Payo
Yate or Buffalo Nation, viewing buffalo
as a source of everything they needed to
survive. What they ate, what they wore,
how they sheltered themselves. They even
played an important role in their
creation story. In the early 19th
century, at least 30 million buffalo
roamed the plains. But as railroads
expanded west, hunters on those trains
killed the herds in mass. The numbers
vary, but by 1887, it's likely that
fewer than 100 individual buffalo
remained in the wild.
Not only did this eliminate a
traditional food source for many, but
for groups like the Great Sue, it
destroyed their way of life, too. And
that destruction was often the point.
American soldiers were ordered to kill
every buffalo on site because, quote,
""Every buffalo dead was an Indian gone.""
The US government knew that without the
buffalo, Native Americans would starve,
which meant that they would be more
willing to sign treaties and hand over
land to them.
Which brings us back to Billy Frank Jr.
and the fish wars. In the mid- 19th
century, the Nusquali and other native
nations who had defined themselves as
salmon people, signed treaties with the
US government, seeding millions of acres
of land in what's now Washington state.
But they signed under a few big
conditions, including that they'd keep
the right to fish there, just as they
always had. But thanks to decades of
logging, mining, commercial fishing, and
other man-made activities, by the mid
20th century, the salmon population was
collapsing, just as the buffalo had done
before them. And under state laws passed
to protect the fish, law enforcement
started cracking down on fishing, but
not in the offshore spots where bougie
fishing boats were catching most of the
salmon. They disproportionately
monitored the riverbanks, where native
people and their nets took in less than
5% of the annual catch. cuz that's fair.
And that's how Frank Jr. first got
arrested for fishing, which at the time
he didn't consider to be a political
act. It was more about having something
to eat. But the arrest didn't stop.
Frank Jr. and the other native fishers
knew the history of their treaty rights.
They knew exercising those rights was
legal according to the US government,
but illegal according to state law. And
they knew that having access to fish
supported their health, their cultural
identity, and their survival. And well,
that's all pretty political. So, the
fish wars began. By the 1960s, Frank Jr.
and other native activists were taking
part in nonviolent acts of civil
disobedience, which is when people
intentionally break laws as a form of
protest. They staged demonstrations,
including fish, where they asserted
their treaty rights. They face sabotage
and violence from non-native fishermen
and clashes with state police. But they
also attracted nationwide attention,
drawing support from celebrities like
Marlon Brando.
And Frank Jr. got arrested a lot. He was
good at it. I was not a policy guy, he
once said. I was a getting arrested guy.
Then in 1974, he and other native
activists finally got their day in
court. In a landmark decision called the
Bolt decision, the judge upheld the
treaty rights and ruled that native
nations in Washington were entitled to
half of the harvestable catch. Can you
make some noise for this huge win?
And that brings me to an important
point. Food sovereignty really can't be
separated from regular sovereignty. When
communities can't practice their
traditional food ways or access
highquality foods, like we saw with the
Great Sue and the Nquali, the health and
well-being of those communities suffers.
While it doesn't always lead to civil
disobedience like in the fish wars,
every native nation in the US has
experienced some type of disruption to
the traditional food systems. And often
those distinct experiences bleed
together into a common story, one about
separation and resilience.
Take fried bread for example, a dectable
deep fried disc of flour, salt, water,
and baking powder that's a staple at
Powows. But the dish itself has a
complicated past. Frib's origins likely
traced back to the 1860s when the US
government forced thousands of members
of the Navajo nation to leave their
homelands. Hundreds died on that nearly
500 km journey to a reservation in
what's now New Mexico. And the survivors
found the land wasn't good for growing
their traditional staples of corn,
beans, and squash. So the government
rations of white flour, sugar, and lard
helped them make the dough for fry
bread. Other native nations who were
given similar rations started leaning on
fried bread, too. Some native people
today see fry bread as a reminder of how
traditional food systems have been torn
apart, contributing to high rates of
diabetes, heart disease, and other
chronic illnesses. But to others, fried
bread represents comfort and resilience
wrapped up in one, making something out
of nothing and stretching it far enough
to feed everybody.
We can find that same resilience that
ignited the fish wars and brought us
fried bread in the many native food
initiatives happening across the United
States today. The Mongol Food
Sovereignty Project, for example, hosts
harvest festivals, maintains a community
garden, and teaches tribal members how
to prepare salmon and elk. The Cherokee
Nation shares free heirloom seed packets
with their members, encouraging them to
grow and eat the same crops as their
ancestors. And the three sisters project
at Iowa State University partners with
native gardeners to study how growing
corn, beans, and squash together
nourishes people, plants, and the soil.
Plus, native chefs have been making
their mark in the culinary world,
opening restaurants, publishing
cookbooks, and working to bring
traditional foods into the limelight.
Like Mariah Gladstone, a member of the
Black Feet and Cherokee Nations, and the
host of Indiga Kitchen, an online
cooking show. She shares traditional
food knowledge, teaching viewers how to
make penican and basamic menomomen with
dandelion greens.
For thousands of years, native nations
hunted, fished, grew, and gathered food
that sustained their communities and the
places where they lived. Under
colonization, they face violent
disconnection from those food systems
and witness many of their food sources
disappear. But native people also
recognize that when you nourish a
community, you support its ability to
exist. now and in the future. And that's
why many native nations have fought to
keep traditional foods in their
communities or are working to put them
back. Today, the salmon in the Nquali
River still face threats from dams,
habitat destruction, and overh
harvesting, but the state of Washington
now co-manages the river and the fish
alongside the Nwali and other native
nations. And as for Billy Frank Jr., He
remained active in protecting the trib's
treaty rights until his death in 2014. A
year after his death, he was awarded the
Presidential Medal of Freedom and a
National Wildlife Refuge was named in
his honor.
In our next episode, we'll go back in
time to Native Americans first contact
with Europeans. I will see you then.

Mrp0T-4A-2s,"Long ago, if you knew how to listen, you
could hear the trees speaking. The
Podawatami tells stories about this with
trees gathering together, making plans.
Stories where the trees decide how to
grow, how many seeds to produce, how to
survive. And in recent years, non-native
botnists have picked up on the same
thing. Trees really are communicating.
They share resources and information
through chemicals in the air and
networks underground.
So, how did native peoples thousands of
years ago figure out something that
western scientists are only just
discovering? Hi, I'm Jim and this is
Crash Course Native American History.
[Music]
Science is a useful tool for
understanding the world. It's helped us
figure out really complex ideas like
particle physics and evolution and
microwave popcorn. And native people
have made plenty of scientific
discoveries, yet we're often perceived
as anti-science.
So, what gives? Turns out what we
typically consider science today isn't
the only way to arrive at accurate
information. There are a variety of ways
of knowing or means through which people
discover knowledge. And many Native
American ways of knowing are rooted in
observing the earth and living in close
relationship to it since time
immemorial. To paraphrase Pawatami
writer and botnist Dr. Robin Wall
Kimmeer. We tend to think of science as
being neutral and objective where the
conclusions drawn are influenced by the
people doing the concluding. But years
ago, Western scientists assumed plants
didn't communicate because they don't do
so in the ways that look like animal
communication. And later, when
scientists revisited that question with
the understanding that communication
could look really different from what
they'd expect, bingo, they started to
find compelling evidence, which just
goes to show that all knowledge is
influenced by the perspectives we humans
bring to it. And Native American
cultures, even with all of our
diversity, tend to have some
commonalities in our ways of knowing and
viewing the world, like how we tend to
ground relationships and respect and
reciprocity.
There's much more about indigenous world
views, by the way, in episode 6.
Indigenous ways of knowing often begin,
much like the scientific method, with
observation. But in Native American
cultures, this observation can go beyond
the five senses and involve things like
storytelling and oral history. Take
these rare boulder structures built by
native people in the plains region of
the US and Canada, known today as
medicine wheels. Most follow similar
structural patterns like a series of
concentric circles or spokes radiating
from a mound of stones in the center.
Many date back centuries or even
millennia, but there's little
archaeological evidence as to the
purpose of medicine wheels. Were they
built to use as astronomical tools,
locations for rituals? For those
answers, many western practices of
archaeology have proven insufficient. We
need indigenous knowledge. So
archaeologists in Alberta, Canada worked
with elders of the Blackfoot Confederacy
to learn more about these formations.
John Wolfchild of the Kai Nation offered
stories about his late great uncle, the
warrior and tribal chief McCoy Puck, who
was honored with a medicine wheel
memorial. Wolfchug could paint a picture
of McCoy Puck, including his famous top
knot decorated with feathers from his
travels. He sounds like a baller. Sadly,
the McCoy Puck medicine wheel itself has
been lost to cultivation with only a
ravine and depressions in the ground to
show where it once was. But Wolfchild's
stories can inform how we interpret
other medicine wheels, which adds an
important context to our understanding
of human history. Now, Native Americans
did and continue to do a lot more with
their ways of knowing than observe and
remember. They also invent and create.
In fact, Native Americans spearheaded a
bunch of technological innovations
millennia ago that are still used today.
Like the first kayaks were invented by
the Inuit, built from seal skin around
4,000 years ago. Lacrosse was invented
by the Honosi before European settlers
arrived. And the Chumash people ventured
out to sea far before the ancient
cultures of Egypt, Asia, or Europe did.
I'm talking 11,000 years ago. The
Chumash sailed back and forth from the
Channel Islands to the mainland of
what's now Southern California, fishing
with complex hooks and nets, as well as
hunting for seals and waterfell. Over
time, they used their knowledge of the
ocean and the Pacific coastline to build
some of the most technologically
advanced ships in North America, like
the Tommo. These canoes could be up to
30 feet long and consisted of planks
tied together. They were made watertight
with pine tar, which was boiled and
hardened. The preferred material was
redwoods that had drifted down the coast
from the north because the Chumash knew,
you know, they had their ways of knowing
that this wood rotted much more slowly
than the other types.
All of this reflects how native ways of
knowing have been making things happen
for thousands and thousands of years.
And in many cases, these innovations are
still a part of both native and
non-native life today. Like the Chumar
people still build tombl that could be
seen gliding along the ocean near the
channel islands. While western
scientists have long misunderstood and
at times downright disregarded native
ways of knowing, that's slowly starting
to change. Today, there's a new movement
aimed at braiding the two world views
together. The Migma people have a word
for this braiding edu. It means two-eyed
scene, a concept developed by Migmog
Elder Albert Marshall. The idea is that
one eye should look through the lens of
native knowledge, the other through the
lens of western science, but both should
work together to form the full picture.
For example, in 2023, Nicole man
embodied Iduptuk when she made history
as the first indigenous woman in space.
She's a NASA astronaut and a member of
the Waki of the Round Valley Indian
tribes and she spent 157 days in a
floating laboratory on the International
Space Station. While she was on board,
man performed spacew walks, spoke to
students back on Earth, and studied
plant growth. She later told reporters
that there's a psychological aspect to
growing plants in space that helps you
feel connected to your home planet, one
that could benefit humans on long space
voyages in the future and a sentiment
that reflects the deep connection to
place found in native ways of knowing.
While in orbit, she also had the
opportunity to speak to students at the
Flathead Indian Reservation, something
she saw as a really important
responsibility. Her hope was that it
might inspire native children to pursue
their own careers in science. The next
end of native space explorers is going
to be epic. Back on Earth, two-eyed
seeing is being used to tackle some of
the world's most pressing issues. Like
today, around 2 million of Earth's
species face extinction thanks to human
activity. But this decline is happening
at a significantly slower rate on
indigenous lands where globally there's
less deforestation and lower pollution
levels. Yeah, we're cool like that.
Thanks to their deeply rooted connection
to their lands, native people have
developed some of the most effective
means of environmental care. In fact,
today many conservationists see
indigenous land management as one of the
best ways to protect against
biodiversity loss.
For example, in what's now Montana, the
Confederated Salish and Coupney tribes
or the CSKT have long practice
controlled burns to encourage new plant
growth and reduce the risk of forest
fires. Today, they manage over 400,000
acres of conservation land, including
the CSKT Bison Range, a former national
wildlife refuge established on the land
originally taken from the tribes in the
early 20th century. After negotiating
for many years to have the land returned
to the tribes, it was successfully
restored to their care in 2020. Now
under the management of the CSKT Natural
Resource Department, tribal biologists
use controlled burns to remove fire
hazards, protect native plants, and open
up more grazing for the bison who live
on the range. In addition, the Bison
Range Museum is now used to educate
visitors about the trib's history and
their traditional practices. Initiatives
like this have been so successful that
simply giving more land back to native
peoples have been suggested as a major
strategy for combating climate change.
We'll talk much more about native
ecology in a future episode.
Indigenous people have been learning
about and connecting to the world since
longer than anyone can remember.
Listening to the trees,
protecting buffalo herds, and much more.
And way before scientists was even a
word, native folks weren't just
learning, but they were actively
inventing and still are. But they're
also finding ways to bring Western
science into the fold, too. And in the
spirit of two-eyed scene, native
scientists like Nicole Man are passing
on both to future generations.
As we say here at Crash Course,
knowledge weighs nothing. Carry all that
you can. In our next episode, we're
going to talk about traditional Native
Foods. I'll see you then. Thanks for

T_MjSrQk1VU,"In 1897, some 20,000 people paid a
quarter each to gawk at six living,
breathing Inuit who had just arrived in
New York Harbor. They had been brought
from Greenland by explorer Robert E.
Perry. Anthropologist France Boaz had
suggested inviting a single Enoch back
to New York for the winter to collect
information of the greatest scientific
importance. For reasons known only to
Perry, he brought back six, plus barrels
full of bones stolen from Inuit graves.
Among the living was a young boy named
Mick whose life along with others
highlights the fraught relationship
between native peoples and western
anthropologist.
Hi, I'm Jim and welcome to Crash Course
Native American History.
Anthropology is the study of what it
means to be human, which involves a lot.
Everything from how people use language
to what they eat to their genetics.
Archaeology, a sub field of
anthropology, has to do with
understanding past humans by studying
what they left behind. Old buildings,
tools, even human remains. Those are
pretty impressive goals. Understand
humanity past and present. But
anthropology and archaeology grew from
twisted colonial roots. At first, from
Europeans trying to understand the
indigenous peoples in the places they
taken over, often positioning themselves
as objective observers. and the native
folks as inhuman specimens. And often
taking native land went handinhand with
taking native bodies. And I want to let
you know now, we're about to talk about
some dark and heavy history. It's
difficult to note the exact numbers, but
between the 1780s and the 1970s, it's
estimated that people in the US dug up
anywhere from 600,000 to over 1 million
native graves. Even some of America's
founding fathers got in on it. Sometime
around 1780, Thomas Jefferson unearthed
a native burial mound near his home in
Virginia. He was curious about who built
it, but not curious enough to ask the
native folks he'd seen paying respects.
Jefferson estimated there might have
been a thousand skeletons buried there.
That's great, Tom. By the 19th century,
soothing out native graves in the name
of science was big business. The going
rate for a skull was estimated to be $3
to5 or about $99 to $165 in today's
money. American museums were vindictions
of bones and their reputations as
serious places of science. Many
generally believe that by taking
artifacts, including human remains, from
native communities, they were helping
preserve the history of the people who'd
soon be gone forever. Early museums had
even set up displays of native bodies
alongside dinosaur fossils and those of
other extinct species. Hello, not
extinct, still here. Often digging up
native graves wasn't even about research
or furthering the study of humanity. In
the late 19th and early 20th centuries,
Americans of all ages were into
collecting native artifacts and remains
for fun. Country doctors, philanthropic
society ladies, and wealthy collectors.
Even the Boy Scouts joined in. I didn't
know that there was a merit badge for
grave robbing. Some early
anthropologists and other scientists
wanted to get their hands on native
remains to measure skulls looking to
prove bogus claims of white superiority.
Insecure much? Czech anthropologist
Elish herd Lichka was among them. He dug
up and stole the remains of 800 CIO
people among others. By the time he died
in 1943, he had almost 20,000 skulls in
his possession. And William McGee, the
first president of the American
Anthropological Association, wrote in
1901 that Native Americans were quote
strikingly close to subhuman species in
every aspect. He also dropped out of
school at 14. So let that be a lesson.
Stay in school, kids. Even
anthropologist France Boaz, who argued
that no culture or group of people is
better than another, felt digging up
native remains was necessary to uncover
what humans had in common. In 1888, he
wrote in his diary, ""It is the most
unpleasant work to steal bones from a
grave, but someone has to do it."" I'd
argue, in fact, someone does not have to
do it. Fron, which brings us back to
Manik, because all these biases about
Native Americans didn't just affect how
anthropologists treated Native
ancestors, it also affected how they
treated living people. Manik and the
other Inuit were brought to live in the
basement of New York's Museum of Natural
History, where they were studied and
ooled by curious crowds. But four of
them soon contracted tuberculosis and
passed away, including Manik's father,
Kisuk. The last remaining adult was
returned to the Arctic, leaving only
Manik in New York. A funeral for Kisuk
was held in the museum's garden, but the
body on display was a fake. In reality,
all the bodies had been dissected and
kept at the museum where Herd Lichka,
the terrifying one from earlier, studied
and wrote articles about them. Minik
spent the rest of his life petitioning
the museum to return the remains of his
father and the other Inuit whose bones
had been secretly stolen. He even sought
the help of President Theodore
Roosevelt. But it didn't work. The
museum denied him again and again. And
when Manik died during the 1918 flu
pandemic, his father's remains were
still in the museum's collection. And
what's especially haunting is that
Minik's story wasn't an anomaly. The
Smithsonian alone still holds 18,500
ancestral remains, many of them
collected by her lichka. So for almost
190 years, native people were treated as
objects to be displayed and studied.
Many early anthropologists felt they
needed to salvage knowledge of native
cultures before colonization destroyed
them altogether. And for those of you
who don't speak colonizer, salvage
roughly means to steal.
[Music]
Great piece for the museum.
Oh, look at this. Oh, how exotic. Yes.
Not today, Carl.
[Music]
Museum. Grave robbing. What a legacy.
But native communities were already
keepers of their own cultures. And even
when anthropologists were collecting
stories, not bones, they didn't always
treat this as a partnership with native
people. Vernon Finley, director of the
Coupney Culture Committee, recalls his
grandfather describing how
anthropologists rarely interpreted
elders stories correctly or let elders
know what they do with those stories.
Back then, anthropologists love to work
on a just trust us basis that they maybe
hadn't earned. And of course, there were
all those thousands of ancestors
remains. But that started to change in
the late 1960s with the arrival of
groups like the American Indian Movement
or AIM, a nativeled civil rights
coalition which expressed widespread
feelings of anger at the exploitation of
native people. Members of AIM staged
protests at excavation sites and
roadside attractions where ancestral
remains were still on display. And
believe me, back then those were
everywhere. This country is so haunted.
Thanks in part to pressure from
indigenous activists like these, the law
slowly began to change, starting with
the National Historic Preservation Act
in 1966 and the Archaeological Resources
and Protection Act in 1979.
Both laws helped establish more
protections for native archaeological
sites and begin to shift the control of
those sites back to native peoples. Then
in 1990 came a super significant piece
of legislation, the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
or NAGPRA.
NAGPRA
Nagra
Nagpra aimed to help the return of both
artifacts and ancestral remains to the
rightful tribe upon request. The museums
that held those materials had to consult
with tribes about them, and the law
created a process for how federal
agencies should handle any remains or
materials found in the future. Finally,
no more rogue scientists on the loose.
But more than 30 years since NAGPRO was
passed, between 300,000 and 600,000
remains are still held in museums across
the country. And in part, that's because
this system is far from perfect. For
one, it only applies to institutions
that have accepted federal funding.
Also, sometimes it's hard to determine
exactly which tribe human remains or
artifacts came from, which can and has
been used as an excuse for holding on to
these objects. But when it comes to more
just, respectful anthropology, NACRA
isn't the end of the line. In the 1970s,
a collaboration between archaeologists
and the Macau tribe in the Pacific
Northwest proved that respectful
excavations could be successful. After a
storm exposed an ancient whailing
village, the Macau brought in
archaeologists who worked for 11 years
to excavate thousands of wooden
artifacts, baskets, animal bones, and
longouses. By combining the trib's oral
histories of a great mudslide with the
scientists' findings that the artifacts
were about 500 years old, they were able
to create a more complete picture of the
area's history. The McCall retained all
55,000 unearthed artifacts as a
condition of the dig, which the tribe
now curates at the mall cultural and
research center, which completely
unrelated, is super close to where the
Twilight movie takes place. #team Jacob.
We names got to stick together.
And today more and more indigenous
people are changing how research gets
done through decolonized archaeology and
anthropology which are described as
with, for, and by indigenous people.
This research values native sovereignty,
knowledge, and perspectives and involves
collaborating using tribal members own
interpretations. And above all, it keeps
native peoples in charge of managing
their own heritage. And if all this
sounds like the opposite of early
archaeology and anthropology, that's
because it is. In fact, when indigenous
archaeology first began in the 1990s,
some Native Americans saw it as an
oxymoron. How could an indigenous person
participate in a field that has caused
so much harm to their people. But some
saw it as a way to truly control our
cultural resources and make it much more
difficult for prejudiced ideas about
Native Americans to spread. Linda
Tuhiwise Smith, author of a book on how
to decolonize research, explained it
like this. When indigenous peoples
become the researchers and not merely
the research, the activity of research
is transformed. I'll leave you with
this. In 2021, the American
Anthropological Association issued an
apology for all the harm that it's done
historically. And though it didn't
happen in Manik's lifetime, thanks to
the tireless work of others like him,
his father's body was eventually
returned to his ancestral homelands in
1993.
Archaeology and anthropology started as
fields that both accidentally and
purposefully harmed indigenous peoples
even after they were dead. And while
strides have been made in recent years,
largely as a result of dedicated
indigenous activists, there's still a
long way to go. But indigenous
anthropologists are working to make the
field more just, not only for the people
of the past, but for the future as well.
In our next episode, we'll continue our
discussion about indigenous science when
we talk about ways of knowing the world.

iNG9UYbZHws,"Welcome to Is This a Real Sex Thing?
Here's your first and only question.
Which of these is not a real sex thing?
Being aroused by feet, using foods
during sex, like melted chocolate or
whipped cream, and enjoying being
blindfolded during sex.
It's a trick question. They're all real
sex things.
Hi, I'm Sham Booram. This is Crash
Course Sexed. Today we're talking about
kinks and how common they really are.
We'll be right back after these
messages.
A kink is a non-conventional sexual
behavior or desire. Things like wanting
to be watched during sex or being really
into rubber outfits. Sometimes these
desires live in the realm of fantasy
where just a mental image turns a person
on and they don't actually act on it.
Other times those desires are an active
part of someone's sex life. As a
culture, we often think of kinks as the
Diablo level in the Taco Bell hot sauce
taxonomy. Mild is for the masses, but
only some go for the really hot spicy
stuff. Except apparently a lot of people
go for the spicy hot stuff. And kinks,
they're more common than you might
think. As we learned way back in our
first episode, our ideas about which
sexual expressions are normal are shaped
by the time and place we live in. In
reality, when it comes to sexuality and
sexual behavior, variety is the norm.
Just check out these three studies from
Canada, Italy, and the US. Over half of
surveyed Canadians said they'd fantasize
about having sex in public or being
dominated. 68% of Italians said they'd
had a kinky fantasy at least once in
their lives. The most common being
voyerism or getting aroused by watching
someone else get undressed, be naked, or
engage in sexual activity. And more than
90% of surveyed Americans said they'd
fantasized about being dominated or
dominating their partner. No, the survey
was not conducted in a movie theater
showing 50 Shades of Gray. But why,
Shan? I hear you asking. Why do some
people like pain or tentacle stuff or
wearing diapers? Wherefore out thou
kinky? Well, compared to other sex
related topics, there hasn't been a ton
of research about kinks. But from what
studies have been done so far, the
answer may be a lot of reasons. One
hypothesis is that kinks are learned.
Kind of like how Pavlov's dog started
drooling when they heard a bell because
they associated the sound with
dinnertime. Sometimes if an early
experience of pleasure co-stars a not
obviously sexy object, sexy feelings can
become linked to it and voila, a kink is
born. Certain kinks may also correlate
with personality traits like if someone
is introverted or extroverted and those
traits can be influenced by genetics.
But the data on this is especially
limited. It's just not something many
researchers have asked people about. You
also might have heard these kinds of
sexual interests described as fetishes,
but a fetish isn't the same thing as a
kink. A kink broadly describes taboo
sexual behaviors, even if they're not
actually that unusual. But a fetish is a
particular type of kink where somebody's
aroused by a specific object like
leather or underwear or a non-genital
body part like hair or feet. In any
case, one 2017 study found that if
somebody had a fetish, that's not the
only way they wanted to have sex. They
just extra enjoyed it that way. Here's
the thing, though. When Diablo sauce or
mango habanero or debomb isn't something
you're personally into, it's easy to get
caught up in your own ick and judge
people who do like it. That's part of
why some people with fetishes may
hesitate to tell their partners about
them. But as long as everybody involved
consents, kinks and fetishes can be a
fun and fulfilling part of sex. Like to
give one big example, a kink that often
gets misunderstood is BDSM. The
definition has changed over time, but
today it's generally understood to cover
bondage, discipline, and submission and
sadism and masochism. Sex acts that
often play with power dynamics or giving
and receiving pain. Which might sound
surprising. How does translate into ooh?
Well, there's some evidence that the
processing of pleasure and pain are
closely linked in the brain since they
both are tangled up in the opioid and
dopamine systems. But playing with pain
requires caution. Research has shown
that injuries from BDSM activities do
happen both intentionally and
unintentionally, but the BDSM community
puts a strong emphasis on consent and
safety. In good BDSM practices, it's
crucial to talk about what's on the
table and what's off limits before
getting started, to use a safe word that
puts a stop to the action at any time,
and to move back into a place of care
and gentleness as things taper off. And
for many, it's the meaning given to the
pain that makes it pleasurable. Some
people who enjoy BDSM say the contrast
of pain makes the feeling of pleasure
stronger. Kind of like adding salt to
chocolate chip cookies to bring out the
sweetness. And sometimes BDSM isn't all
about having sex. For a lot of people,
the appeal is giving up power or taking
power in ways they don't always get to
do in their everyday lives, what's
called power exchange. The same could be
said for furries. People who roleplay as
human-like animals through art, writing,
or dressing up in costumes known as
fursuits as a part of their persona. For
some furries, that's partially a sex
thing, but not always. The appeal can
also be imagination, play, and the
freedom of shedding their regular selves
for a while. Whether sex is part of the
picture or not, no matter the reason,
humans do be kinky. But is there a point
where kinky behaviors go from fun spicy
taco topping to why would anyone make a
sauce that hot? In other words, is there
a point where kinks become a problem?
Well, it depends. Any good thing can
become a problem if taken to extremes.
But where exactly that line falls can be
complicated. So-called abnormal sexual
interests aren't inherently bad. The
DSM5, the American Psychiatric
Association's guide for classifying and
diagnosing mental illnesses, uses the
term paraphilia. Parah meaning going
beyond and filia meaning attachment to
describe an intense and persistent
sexual interest between consenting adult
partners. By itself, this isn't
necessarily a problem. But if someone's
paraphilia becomes distressing or
harmful to themselves or others, the
DSM5 classifies it as a paraphilic
disorder. In this case, someone might be
referred to a counselor or prescribed a
medication. Some experts warn that
classifying certain behaviors as
disorders is problematic because what's
considered normal often depends on
cultural and sociopolitical factors. So,
there are calls for more research around
paraphilic disorders to clarify the
DSM's classifications. Kinks aren't for
everybody. If they were, they wouldn't
be kinks. But a lot of the ones that
many people think of as unusual aren't
as uncommon as they're made out to be.
What we do, think, and feel when it
comes to sex can be an expression of who
we are, but it's also shaped by the time
and place we live in. In the end,
sexuality is deliciously diverse. That's
a theme we've kept coming back to
throughout this entire series. What's
one person's yes, please might be
another person's no thanks. And you know
what? That's thrilling. There's room for
everyone to have an amazing time with a
partner who feels the same way. There's
space to keep trying new things or
return to tried and true favorites. No
matter the recipe, good sex comes down
to the same ingredients. It's consensual
and it's safe. And there's trust, fun,
and delight for everybody involved. And
with that, Crash Course Sex Ed is a
wrap.

27zUjzYG4gY,"Masturbate. Charming the snake. Flicking
the bean. Blowing your own horn. Okay,
enough with the euphemisms. I'm gonna go
ahead and just say it. Masturbation.
It's something that many people do
throughout their lives. And humans are
far from the only animals who like a
little me time. But sometimes
masturbation is coupled with shame. So,
let's do what we do and talk about it.
Hi, I'm Shamboo and this is Crash Course
Sexed.
Masturbation is stimulating your own
genitals for sexual pleasure, which is a
really clinical way to describe
something humans have been enjoying for
a long time. According to evolutionary
biologists in some saucy prehistoric
rock paintings, humans have been
masturbating for probably as long as
we've been around. And if it's not your
thing, no sweat. But if it is, you're
not alone. Even if no one's talking
about it. Surveys show that most people
masturbate regardless of their gender,
sexual orientation, age, or relationship
status. Yeah. So, it's not just dudes
and single people. Masturbation is a
totally normal part of human sexuality,
and everyone has their own relationship
to it, including how they do it. For
instance, archaeologists have discovered
objects that were used as sex toys going
as far back as the Han Dynasty in
ancient China. And today, sexual aids
are making it possible for more people
of all abilities to enjoy sex. Teensh,
let him know. In the 1960s, there was a
lot of free love, baby. But not everyone
was included in this so-called sexual
revolution, especially disabled people.
They wanted to have sex and did, but a
lot of non-disabled folks saw them as
devoid of sexuality. That's where GZnell
Duncan came in. In 1965, an accident
left him paralyzed from the waist down,
which caused him to not be able to get
an erection. As he got involved in the
disability rights movement, he learned
he wasn't the only one thinking about
the intersection of disability and
sexuality. Part of the problem at the
time, sex toys were not great. Most were
made of harsh smelling rubber that
couldn't be washed and that melted in
heat. So Duncan worked with a chemist to
create the world's first silicone dildo.
Washable, sharable, and easily used with
low hand mobility. And even though he
made it for disabled folks, silicone
became the thing in sex toys, which
makes for a nicer, more hygienic time
for people of all abilities. The world
of sex toys has come a long way since
those rubber dildos from the 60s. Today,
there are tons of different kinds for
all sorts of interests, sexualities, and
abilities. A few words to the wise when
it comes to sex toys. Use condoms for
shared toys. Only use objects that are
specifically made for sexy time. And the
golden rule, nothing goes up the butt if
it doesn't have a flared base.
Otherwise, it could get sucked up there.
Emergency rooms have truly seen it all,
y'all. So, masturbation is natural and
normal and has been around forever. But
is paddling the pink canoe or polishing
the banister good for you? Short answer,
it can be. Beyond just feeling good,
many people have reported that
masturbation can help them relax,
relieve anxiety and pain, and fall
asleep. Scientists still have a lot to
learn about why that is, but one reason
could be the increase of the hormones
dopamine and oxytocin during orgasm,
which can counteract cortisol, aka the
stress hormone. Masturbation also
stimulates the release of
neurotransmitters called
endockinabonoids which regulate things
like sleep, pain, and immune responses.
And there might be some long-term
medical benefits, too. Some research has
even found that for people with vulvas,
the increased blood flow from
masturbating regularly can help keep
genital tissue healthy. And other
studies have found that for folks with
penises, more frequent ejaculation has
some relationship with lowering the risk
of developing prostate cancer later on
in life. Although it's not clear why
yet, sex educators have also observed
that masturbation can help people get to
know their body and themselves as a
sexual being. It can help them figure
out what they like, what they don't
like, and build a foundation they can
explore with others if they choose to.
With women in particular, studies have
found that single women who masturbated
reported being more sexually satisfied
when they had partnered sex. And
overall, women who masturbate are more
sexually confident and have a more
positive self-image. And masturbation
provides all these benefits with no risk
of STI or pregnancy. Now, that's what I
call an MVP. Of course, there can be
such a thing as masturbating too much.
If it gets in the way of someone's
responsibilities or social life, it's a
good idea to talk to a doctor or a
counselor. But in general, many studies
have found evidence that the five finger
shuffle can have upsides. So why do many
cultures give it a bad rep? It turns out
people haven't always been cy about
masturbation. Back in the timeline,
people openly acknowledged it more,
including in creation stories. Like the
ancient Sumerians believe one of their
gods created the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers by ejaculating. And the ancient
Egyptians believe that one of their gods
created the entire universe by
masturbating. Now, that's some BDE. The
ancient Greeks saw masturbation as a
normal bodily function, but for them, it
did have a judgy edge to it. It was seen
as something for lowerass citizens, and
they weren't the last to give
masturbation some side eye. Many
religions take a negative view of
self-pleasure for different reasons.
Some see masturbation as an expression
of lust, while others teach that sex is
something a person should only do with
their spouse. But some of the shade has
also come from historical doctors and
scientists whose inaccurate ideas have
bled over into the 21st century. For
instance, in the 1700s, a famous Swiss
doctor named Samuel Ugus Tiso
popularized the idea that semen was
quote a vital fluid that shouldn't be
wasted on anything but procreation. In
what turned into a global campaign, he
and other doctors spread the belief that
masturbation made you weak and
infertile. And because back then people
thought semen originated in the brain,
they said masturbating would also lose
you a bunch of IQ points. And the wrong
ideas didn't end there. As time went on,
people started to think that
masturbation wouldn't just cause
physical problems, but psychological
ones, too. In the 18th and 19th
centuries, medical practitioners said
masturbation caused disease,
maladjustment, and even insanity, which
led to some disturbing preventative
methods. Like the Victorians used
anti-masturbation devices that would
hurt the penis if it became erect. You
could order one straight out of a
catalog. And self-proclaimed experts
like Dr. John Harvey Kellogg came up
with other gruesome ideas that are such
nightmare fuel. I'll spare you the
details. His least horrible idea
probably that tasteless fiberbridge
foods would keep the masses from
masturbating, which is part of why he
invented corn flakes. No thank you.
Yeah, that Kellogg. These days, there's
no evidence that masturbating will hurt
your SAT scores or that it causes
psychological issues. But unfortunately,
some new myths have popped up in the
last couple of years. Movements like no
fap and no nut November encourage men in
particular to abstain from masturbation
because of the idea that not
masturbating can lead to benefits like
increased testosterone long-term, which
to be clear has no scientific support.
The big takeaway, masturbation is a
normal part of human sexuality. And
there's no need to feel embarrassed
about it. No one's going to go blind or
bald or grow hair on their palms. Not
from marching the penguin or cuffing the
carrot or turning on the sprinklers. I
can keep them coming, too. Next time, we
are wrapping up the series by exploring
what it means to be kinky. We'll see you
then. This episode of Crash Course Sexed

0MMa2feSIiQ,"What do you see when you picture
findings at an archaeological dig?
Jewelry, pottery, tools. That's all
true, but at Native American sites,
we've also discovered dice made from
animal bones, and pottery shards, sticks
with pockets, and leather covered balls
used for games of, you guessed it, stick
ball. Ancient Nerf guns. Well, sort of.
In short, things made for fun. These
artifacts show us how natives viewed and
interacted with the world thousands of
years ago and help connect ancestors
from the past to natives today. Hi, I'm
Jim and welcome to Crash Course Native
American History.
[Music]
I'll be the first to say that not all
Native people are the same. We all have
different tribal affiliations, different
traditions, a different taste in
Pop-Tarts, minus the cinnamon one. But
there are aspects of being native that
bring us all together. ways native
peoples have viewed the world since time
immemorial that tie us to our ancestors.
And understanding native worldview can
bring us all closer to seeing each other
as nuanced, complex people and not just
stereotypes. Like if you believe
everything the media tells you, you'd
think all Native Americans were stoic
and serious, always serving resting
indigenous face and spouting some next
level wisdom with a single tear
streaming down their cheek. But really,
humor and fun have been parts of native
culture and worldview for generations. I
mean, how else do you think I became a
comedian? It's in my jeans.
Those kids-sized weapons I mentioned
earlier weren't just for teaching
practical hunting skills. They were
toys. Native kids in the past would have
used these mini weapons in games that
taught cooperation and conflict
resolution while building relationships
and having fun. Native kids do the same
thing today. I learned a lot from
crushing my cousins at paintball.
Natives have long considered laughter to
be what we call good medicine or
anything that promotes the healing or
well-being of mind, body, or spirit,
often all three. To understand native
humor is to get a good glimpse into
native world views. As Vine Delora Jr.,
a historian and activist of the Standing
Rock Sue tribe once wrote, ""One of the
best ways to understand a people is to
know what makes them laugh. Laughter
encompasses the limits of the soul.""
Native humor is often dark, satirical,
cheeky, and provocative. Abnaki writer
Joseph Brochack notes that humor and
teasing can be used to remind people
that they aren't better than anyone
else. And writer Tiffany Mitch, a member
of the Standing Rock Sue Nation, tells a
story of laughing with her dying mother
when trying to figure out what to do
with her remains. That conversation led
to the title of her book, Bury My Heart
at Chuck-E-Cheese's.
You know, human remains probably weren't
the weirdest thing that you would find
at Chuck-E-Cheese when I was a kid. That
ball pit was full of secrets.
And for natives, humor wasn't just for
fun. It was a way to create community
and bond the way people do when they
share inside jokes or roast someone on
their tribe's private Facebook page
or text memes back and forth.
Personally, this is my favorite. Many
tribes, like the PBLO people, even
consider humor to be sacred. Some of
their ceremonies feature sacred clowns
called kosharis who are painted in black
and white and act out bad behaviors like
gluttony or laziness to teach the
community about what not to do. There
might be some light reticule in there
too if you haven't been on your agame
lately. And kosharis aren't just funny.
They have natural powers like the
ability to bring rain. In the past, many
Christian missionaries and
anthropologists documented different
variations of native clowns or
tricksters, but they usually didn't get
the joke, especially because clowns
would often make fun of the European
colonizers themselves. Self-awareness
not to settle their strong suit. Those
clowns were part of a centuries long
tradition of natives using humor to cope
and build resilience, finding ways to
laugh about tough stuff like
colonization and persecution. Because if
you can't make fun of the colonizers,
who can you make fun of? The confusion
white colonizers felt when trying to
interpret native humor has shown up in
books, movies, and TV shows where
indigenous representation was for so
long a product of white imaginations,
often depicting native people as
vicious, violent, and humorless and
covered in war paint 24/7. And like we
talked about in episode 3, those
inaccurate and stereotypical
representations of natives have real
consequences, impacting everything from
how natives are treated by police and
the courts to the mental health of
native youth and much more. But accurate
nativeled representations fight against
that. These days, popular TV shows are
bringing native comedic traditions to a
wider audience. like the show's
reservation dogs and Rutherford Falls
were either made up by or with the help
of indigenous creators and much of the
worldview represented in them comes from
actual lived native experiences. I can
watch these shows and be like, ""Yep,
they get me."" And then there are folks
like me, indigenous content creators
bringing native humor to millions of
people online. Humor like this.
[Music]
Dakota and Da actor, comedian, and
activist Dallas Goldtooth has said that
humor can also be an important tool in
reclaiming power from oppressors by
letting that joy fuel action. By the
way, Goldtooth is a member of the 1491s,
a native sketch comedy group who posts
short online videos and appears in both
Reservation Dogs and Ritherford Falls.
What's the native equivalent of a
Renaissance man? a renaissance man. For
Goldtooth and many natives, the ability
to laugh at our oppressors and poke fun
at serious things helps take back a
little bit of power from those
hierarchies and return it to the
natives. Cuz it turns out fun and games
have a lot of power. For example, a
spear throwing game called Chunky may
have been used to hash out diplomatic
relationships between tribes like
Fortnite, but instead of ruining
friendships, it strengthens them. While
conflict and war were common among
native nations before Europeans arrived,
their diplomatic practices also showcase
another important part of native
worldview. Reciprocity or
interdependence between people and all
living and non-living things. Another
way to think of it is I take care of you
and you take care of me. And when it
comes to relationships with other
tribes, peace was good for trade and
trade was good for survival. Let me tell
you a story about one of the most famous
alliances in native history.
Generations ago, five nations were at
war with each other. A tribal leader
named Toddaho had murdered the wife and
daughter of another leader, Hayawenta.
But one day, a man called Peacemaker,
who wanted to spread peace and unity
among the nations, visited Haywenta and
helped him let go of his anchor. As the
story goes, Peacemaker snapped an arrow
in half and showed how easy it was to
break. Then he tied five arrows together
and tried again, but the arrows held
firm. They were stronger together. So
peacemaker and Hayawena demonstrated
this strength to Tatadaho who agreed to
join them under the great law of peace.
The five nations that came together as a
result became known as the Hnesoni or
the Irakcoy Confederacy. An alliance
among the Mohawk, Cynica, Onida,
Anadaga, and Kauga nations. Later the
Tuscarora would join bringing their
ranks to six. The Tuscarora were running
on Indian time. To celebrate their
unity, the Honosi dug up a white pine
tree and threw their weapons in the
hole. And then they planted a new tree
above that hole and named it the tree of
peace.
And that's the story of Peacemaker.
Delicious.
The story of Peacemaker demonstrates the
strength of native interdependence. We
can see this value in the popular native
phrase all my relations in lot
oasan. The idea of all my relations is
that everything not just ourselves is
part of the same great tapestry of the
universe. This dude is my cousin
spiritually speaking. And reciprocity
doesn't just extend to people but to all
living things including plants and
animals and even natural elements like
fire and wind. In fact, the land is so
important to native cultures that we
made a whole episode about it. And there
are lots of ways to express that give
and take relationship with it, like
saying a prayer after a hunt or
returning an animal's bones to the land
or not fracking.
Or there's the tradition of the
honorable harvest. This is a way of
harvesting plants for medicinal,
cultural, and food purposes that seeks
to use the earth's resources
respectfully and gratefully. While there
are variations from nation to nation,
overall the idea is to ask for
permission before harvesting and only
take what's necessary while making sure
there's plenty left behind. Pretty much
the OG reduce, reuse, recycle. After
harvesting, the community can show their
gratitude by saying a prayer or
reciprocating the gift through giving
and offering and caring for the land so
the plants can continue to grow. That
reciprocity and gratitude also extends
to the way native communities view
wealth.
For example, one traditional gathering
is called the pot latch, originating
from the Chinuk Wawwa term meaning to
gift or give. It is much more than just
a gathering. It is a way of
understanding the world. The practice,
which is still used today, is rooted in
honoring relationships with fellow
humans and with the earth through
reciprocity. It is an economic and legal
system that redistributes material and
intangible wealth as a way to honor
debts. Palatches maintain a system of
existence based on honoring the whole
above the self.
These and other ceremonies are important
ways of gathering together in community
and they can bring together all these
different values. Gratitude, respect,
generosity, humor to preserve native
culture and further bond us together.
These values also show up in the ways
many tribes are structured through
systems of kinship or family ties. The
Cheyenne, in particular, have a strict
structure of kinship, though humor is a
big part of it, too. Certain family
relationships, especially the in-laws,
are expected to tease and joke with each
other to maintain harmony, and the
health and balance of the family unit
directly influences the health and the
balance of the tribal band and the
Cheyenne nation as a whole. The history
of Native Americans has often been
overshadowed by the arrival of Europeans
and the subsequent generations of
mistreatment and cultural destruction.
But to bring it back to my boy
Peacemaker, we're stronger together.
Native worldviews and all their
complexity, depth, and diversity derive
from thousands of years of history and
tradition. And generations of playing
games, making peace, sharing feast,
joking about death, and making fun of
ourselves and our oppressors have built
a foundation for tribal strength and
perseverance today.
Next time we're going to explore the
complicated history between Native
Americans and Archaeology, and I will
see you then. Thanks for watching this

edsqqXrIK1k,"Orgasms. They're the shining light at
the end of the sexy tunnel. I see it. I
like it. I want it. I got it. Except
it's not that simple. We tend to put
orgasms on a pedestal as the pinnacle of
sexual experience, but there's a lot
more to doing it than the big O. Hi, I'm
Shamboo Dram and this is Crash Course
[Music]
Sexed. First, a note on language. Most
orgasm research focuses on cisgender
people, aka guys with penises and ladies
with vaginas. So, when we refer to men
and women in this episode, those are the
groups that we're talking about. Humans
have always been more diverse than that,
but there's not much research yet on
trans, interex, and non-binary
experiences. So, with the science we
have now, let's get into it. An orgasm
is the sudden involuntary release of
sexual tension. You get aroused. There's
usually some kind of physical action.
And eventually all that tension releases
with a bunch of super nice contractions
and a rush of feel-good chemicals in
your brain. But behind that simple
description is a lot of complexity. Like
sometimes an orgasm just involves the
star players. Men mostly orgasm from
stimulation of the penis while women
mostly orgasm from stimulation of the
clitoris either internally or
externally. And if you just said, ""Huh?""
That's your cue to watch episode 2. But
there's a whole supporting cast of
characters. Lots of people can
experience pleasure and even orgasm from
nipple or anal stimulation because both
share proximity to the genitals either
in the brain or on the body. And both
have a lot of nerve endings. Men also
have the prostate, a gland about the
size of a walnut that sits a couple
inches inside the rectum. Some people
find that stimulating it can be a really
nice time. Overall though, pretty much
any part of the body can be an arogynous
zone, an area that can trigger sexual
arousal. And what gets someone going is
pretty unique to them. It can be the
nipples, thighs, neck, ears, hands,
feet, you name it. Some people can even
have an orgasm just by thinking sexy
thoughts. How's that for DIY? And after
an orgasm, it might be a few minutes or
hours before you can go at it again,
especially for men. Scientists even have
a name for this downtime, the refractory
period. All said, there are a lot of
ways to orgasm. It all depends on what
works for you. What about the G-spot? My
friend's cousin's neighbor, they told me
all about it, and it's supposed to be
the way to, you know. Good question,
Teenshan. First of all, despite what
past experts and friends, cousins,
neighbors say, there's no ultimate
orgasm because there's no way of
measuring the many dimensions that make
up pleasure. And when it comes to the
infamous G-spot, that arrogynous zone
inside the vagina, turns out researchers
can't really agree on exactly what or
where it is. The G-spot's probably not a
magic orgasm button, but another form of
internal clitoreral stimulation. As for
how we learned all this stuff, we owe
much of what we know to the research duo
William Masters and Virginia Johnson.
They were a gynecologist and a
sexologist at Washington University in
St. Louis, famous for their in-depth
research on human sexuality. Teen Chan,
let them know. It was 1957 and Masters
and Johnson were trying really hard to
make their research not seem sexy
because they needed funding to study
orgasms, which weren't exactly all the
rage at the time. Fortunately, they got
their coin and set up a research lab to
observe people having orgasms with the
help of a penis camera. A what? You
heard me. Women who agreed to be the
subjects would essentially use it to
masturbate and it would record video of
what was happening inside their vaginas.
Masters and Johnson learned tons of
stuff from observing hundreds of women,
especially about how different parts of
the vagina and vulva react during
orgasm. And one of their most notable
findings was a model they called the
human sexual response cycle. A road map
for how bodies respond to sexual stimuli
broken down into four stages:
excitement, plateau, orgasm, and
resolution. At the time, medical
journals weren't willing to publish
their research. So, in 1966, Masters and
Johnson published them in their own book
instead. And after a lot of hate mail,
human sexual response eventually became
a bestseller. The human sexual response
cycle was revolutionary for its time,
although it did have some gaps. Like,
what about desire? What makes someone
want to have sex in the first place? And
what if someone's sexual response
doesn't follow this cycle? Masters and
Johnson theorized that these four stages
work the same for everybody. But since
then, we've learned about some key
differences in how men and women orgasm.
Also, we've learned that orgasm isn't
all about the physical. There are social
aspects at play, too. One of the more
recent models that takes these nuances
into account is called the dual control
model, developed at the Kinsey Institute
in the 1990s by sexologist John Braftoft
and Eric Jansen. This model says every
individual has their own set of offs and
ons like the brakes and accelerators on
a car. Your ons might be physical, like
someone kissing you just right. Or they
might be social. Maybe your partner wore
something attractive, smelled good, or
did something nice for you that wasn't
sexual at all. Maybe they just got the
riz. Similarly, your offs can be
physicals, or they can be less tangible.
Maybe you're tired, or maybe you can't
get the dog to leave the bedroom, and it
really feels like they're just staring
at you. These two control systems work
in tandem throughout the whole sexual
experience, determining if you want to
have sex, if you can reach orgasm, and
how that experience of the orgasm makes
you feel. And because humans are a lot
more complex than wiener mobiles,
everyone's brakes accelerators are
different. When it comes to sex and
gender differences, there is some
evidence to support that women tend to
have more sensitive brakes and men tend
to have more sensitive accelerators, but
those are just averages. In this study,
these differences varied more from
person to person of the same gender than
they did between men and women. That
said, we got to talk about the gap. And
I don't mean the store that your mom
used to buy your basic tees from. Data
shows that men are more likely than
women to orgasm during heterosexual sex.
In one US-based study of more than
50,000 people, 95% of straight men said
that they usually are always orgasm
during sex, while only 65% of straight
women said they do. This gendered
discrepancy is called the orgasm gap. On
one hand, it could be related to
differences in anatomy, including the
location of nerve endings and the fact
that it's pretty easy to stimulate the
penis compared to the smaller and
largely internal clitoris. But social
and cultural attitudes play a role, too.
Sexual scripts, those social
expectations about how to behave when it
comes to sex, can influence whose sexual
pleasure gets prioritized. Like, men
often just need PNV sex to have an
orgasm. But 80% of the straight women in
that 50,000 person survey said they
usually are always orgasmed when they
combine PNV sex with other types of
intimacy like deep kissing, genital
stimulation, or oral sex. And in Western
culture, sexual scripts that stigmatize
women's sexual pleasure can make
partners less likely to engage in the
kind of stimulation that helps women
orgasm. Those same sexual scripts can be
reinforced in sex scenes in movies, TV
shows, and porn, which often show women
orgasming from penetrative sex alone.
Like in a 2018 study of 50 popular porn
videos, almost half of female orgasms
came from PNV sex. Seeing these kinds of
representations can lead women to think
they're supposed to orgasm this way and
fake orgasms with their partner if it
isn't naturally happening. Luckily,
studies have shed some light on what
seems to help reduce the orgasm gap. One
is knowing about the clitoris and how it
works. And two is ditching those sexual
scripts that tell women their pleasure
matters less than men's. In a 2022
survey, researchers found that for
women, both of those things together
were related to a better time in the
bedroom. Orgasms can be great, but they
don't have to be the crown jewel of sex.
Just because someone didn't orgasm
doesn't mean they had a bad time. You
can explore pleasure for pleasure's sake
and connect with your partner with no
end goal in mind. Like sometimes I just
want to drink a nice cup of tea. If a
caffeine rush hits me, great. But if
not, I still had a lovely cupa. Orgasms
can happen in a lot of different ways.
All bodies have the potential for
pleasure. But scientists are still
learning about how orgasms work,
especially outside of cisgender straight
relationships. And while we haven't
quite yet reached orgasm equality, some
good ways to have more of them are by
communicating with sexual partners and
experimenting to find what feels good
for you. We'll keep this conversation
going in next week's episode on
masturbation. See you then. This episode

L3WcELWzNYg,"Think of a place that's important to
you. Maybe it's a lake where you played
as a kid, or a field that glitters at
dusk, or a neighborhood where you know
every street by heart. Now, imagine that
connection you feel goes even deeper.
Imagine it's embedded in your language,
your relative stories, your traditions,
and it's a connection stretching back
generations longer than anyone can
remember.
That's just a taste of what it means
when Native Americans talk about being
connected to a place. Hi, I'm Jay Jim
and this is Crash Course Native American
[Music]
History. When Native Americans talk
about a connection to a place, it
usually goes a lot deeper than I'm from
LA or I'm from Chicago. Many Native
nations like the Yuki of what's now
California have continuously lived in
the same place for thousands of years.
Others, like the Cherokee, still feel
connected to their homeland, even though
they no longer live there. The Cherokee
lived for generations in what's now the
southeastern United States until the
19th century when the federal government
violently removed them from those lands
and forced them to move to present day
Oklahoma. But this connection is about
more than just the physical land. Like,
yeah, it's made of trees and rocks, but
also water, sky, other plants and
animals, forces like thunder and wind,
seasons and stars. Natives view all
these elements as part of a living
breathing hole that humans aren't
separate from. And this worldview
stretches across different native
nations and cultures. The podawatamy of
what's now the Great Lakes region often
described the land as mean Goyak, which
means that which has been given to us.
It's a phrase that invokes every life
sustaining thing the land holds that's
offered up for free. Sunlight, water,
food, shelter, and medicine. The idea
that the land takes care of you and in
return you take care of it. I think
Robin Wall Kimmer a Pawatami botnist
said it best. Land is everything.
Identity, the connection to our
ancestors, the home of our non-human
kinfolk, our pharmacy, our library, the
source of all that sustained us. It
belonged to itself. It was a gift, not a
commodity, so it could never be bought
or sold. She's got bars. And we see this
perspective in many native traditions
like every June on the coast of what's
now Washington, salmon emerge from the
ocean and swim into the freshwater
rivers. The coast sish people describe
this as part of a sacred agreement.
Salmon come into the rivers, offering
themselves as food for people. But in
return, people must care for salmon by
cleaning the rivers, greeting the first
salmon, and returning that salmon's
bones back to the water. And every year
during the first salmon ceremony, that's
exactly what co- Salish people do,
gathering to sing, dance, and pray to
hold up their end of the bargain. Or
like some tribes in what's now
California, weave baskets from native
grasses, twigs, roots, and ferns. The
designs they create tell traditional
stories of their
homeland. To this day, people who
practice this tradition literally weave
their ties to the land into their
creations.
Many native languages also reveal these
close ties with nature. Lucid, for
example, is spoken by many coast sus
tribes from the area that's now called
the Pusian sound. These groups share the
perspective that every part of the land
has a voice and often it's called its
own name.
Like that's crow. There's stol which
means river that comes from the sound of
water pouring over rocks. and clutch
which means salt water and calls to the
mind waves washing up on the beach. So
sometimes native languages sound like
the land but often they share ideas
about the land too like the word onaban
gizus in the Ojiway language is one way
to refer to the month of March but
really it refers to the hard crust on
the snow moon. the moon or month where
the top layer of the snow melts during
the day and then freezes at night. Or
when the honosy count from 1 to 10,
they're not just counting, they're also
telling their story of how the land came
into existence and reaffirming their
ties to it. Like the word for one is
also the word for Skywoman who arrived
first in their creation story. The word
for two refers to Skywoman's daughter
who came next. And the word for three
refers to Skywoman's daughter and her
twin grandsons. All these connections
exist on a mind-blowing time scale. So
ancient it's often described as since
time immemorial. In other words, so long
ago is before any record or memory. I'm
talking about connections that go all
the way back to Native Americans
ancestors. Ancestors ancestors.
Ancestors ancestors. Ancestors.
Ancestors.
Ancestor
ancestor. They've had thousands of years
to simmer. The US origin story often
makes it seem like Europeans stumbled on
an untamed wilderness and that it was
fine, noble even, to claim this barely
touched place, but that just wasn't
true. North America was very much
occupied. John
Green. This will do.
[Music]
In 2023, researchers confirmed that
human footprints preserved in the mud in
what's now New Mexico were as many as
23,000 years old, thousands of years
before Europeans came. The land here
teamed with life. Native villages,
farms, nations, and confederations of
nations. Some groups settled in one
place. Others moved with the seasons,
and trade networks spread across the
continent, connecting different nations
through trails and waterways. Like over
1600 years ago, indigenous people living
in what's now Ohio built the Hopewell
Earth Works. Enormous earthn mounds
formed into precise geometric shapes and
they transported goods to the ceremonial
site from all over what's now North
America like obsidian rock from what's
now Idaho and seashells and fossilized
megalodon teeth from the Gulf Coast.
Everywhere they went, natives developed
highly specialized way of living with
the land. like the Ashue or the Zouri in
what's now New Mexico invented a way of
farming in a place where it hardly rains
at all using moisture trapping grids and
Hata of what's now North Dakota spent
part of their year growing food on Primo
riverfronts. Then when the river flooded
every year, they moved around and hunted
knowing the soil would be turbo boosted
with nutrients by the time they
returned. Work smarter, not harder. My
point is this place was lived in. There
was deep active relationships between
native people and the elements of the
land around them. Natives managed the
landscape, clearing, planting, hunting,
fishing, and building. And they knew
their stuff. For example, tribal nations
across the continent used fire as a
tool, burning smaller patches of land to
boost the growth of certain plants and
prevent much larger wildfires.
Some scholars even argue that native
people even molded the environment in
ways that other living things depended
on. And native people depended on those
living things right back. But then
Europeans came knocking, carrying
diseases that ballooned into epidemics.
They also brought invasive species like
rats that had no natural predators,
making life harder for native species. I
mean, I'm not saying colonists were an
invasive species, but and of course,
they also brought colonialism, that
system where one group of people
dominates and subjugates another. They
also brought a hunger for land. As
colonists kept flowing in and that
hunger grew, so did efforts to remove
native people from their land and claim
those lands for themselves. Many tribes
were forced into reservations and then
many of those lands were split into
aotments assigned to individual tribal
members. But aotments just shrank tribal
lands further so that non-native people
could swoop in and claim more of it for
their own. Today, at least much of the
Western world, it's property that gets
treated as sacred, not the land itself.
And because of this dominant worldview,
many native communities have been
separated from the land they've been in
relationship with since time immemorial,
including sacred sites.
Thankfully, many native communities are
reclaiming stewardship of their
ancestral homelands, striving to heal
places that had been harmed and care for
them like they deserve to be cared for.
For example, in the 18th and 19th
centuries, over 2 million acres in
what's now New York were taken from the
Anadaga nation, including Anadaga Lake.
The Anadaga consider that lake sacred,
but it's been abused, used, and polluted
with toxic waste in the past hundred
years. But in 2022, 1,000 acres of that
forest were put back under the Anadaga
Nation stewardship, including the
headwaters of the creek that flows into
that lake. For thousands of years, the
Anadaga cared for these waters like
relatives, and now they're back in the
family. And in recent years, about
onethird of the land that was taken from
the Bakoj or Iowa tribe has been
transferred back to tribal ownership.
They've turned the land into a tribal
national park that can be used for
hiking and camping and will preserve the
land and stories of the Iowa people for
future
generations. As landsets return to
native stewardship, populations of
bison, eagles, trumpeter swans, and
herring are being restored, invasive
species eliminated, and habitats in
grasslands, forests, and rivers revived
in regions from present day Montana to
Virginia. From a native perspective, the
land is so much more than what we see
and touch. It's everything. Our home,
our responsibility, the source of
sustenance for our bodies and spirits,
and part of our identity. For many
native people, restoring land to native
stewardship serves as an acknowledgement
of native peoples ourselves, a step
towards ensuring tribal sovereignty. For
native youth, it's a step towards the
future. Native Americans have thousands
of years of experience taking care of
the land, and that responsibility and
knowledge gets passed on from generation
to
generation. As Iowa Tribal Vice Chairman
Lance Foster said, ""We've been here for
a thousand years now, and unlike other
people who can buy and sell land and
move away, we can never move away. This
is our land forever. Here's to the next
thousand years."" In our next episode,
we're going to unpack some common
aspects of Native Worldviews, and I will
see you then. Thanks for watching this

History, which was filmed at our studio

HvaUdCTMkkk,"Let's be honest. If you've been on the
internet, you've probably seen porn.
Whether you went looking for it, a
friend shoved a video under your nose,
or you got a sketchy DM, it's hard not
to come across porn in our extremely
online world. Either way, your first
encounter with porn might have piqued
your curiosity, or it might have even
disturbed you. It's okay. We're going to
unpack all of that together. Hi, I'm
Sham Budram and this is Crash Course Sex
Ed. Heads up. In today's video, we'll be
discussing a sensitive topic, including
sexual assault and descriptions of
certain kinds of sex acts. So, please
keep that in mind and take care when
watching. We learn about sex from a lot
of different sources, but nobody seems
to want to admit that for a lot of
people, one of their biggest teachers is
pornography. Videos, films, magazines,
and other forms of media that are meant
for sexual arousal. No matter what
popped into your head when I first said
porn, the word has a pretty broad
definition because what's considered
arousing can really vary from person to
person. In a Supreme Court case about
which sexual material was obscene enough
to censor, one of the justices said porn
was hard to define, but I know it when I
see it. Whatever it is, porn is a part
of our society. Like one survey from
2022 found that 73% of teenagers may
have seen porn online, many before the
age of 13. despite the rise of age
restriction laws that require viewers to
be 18 or older. Well, I definitely don't
watch porn. Girl, I'm you. I know you're
lying, but I don't blame you. Cuz here's
the thing. The way sex classes and the
adults in our lives talk about porn, if
they do at all, is often full of shame.
And that leaves people with a sense that
they shouldn't ask questions. But it
turns out one of the best ways to
responsibly engage with porn is by
getting curious. The first thing to
know, images that we might consider
pornographic today have been around
forever. Peruvian sex pods sculpted 1500
years ago. Fresco from first century
Pompei, 17th century erotic Japanese
paintings. Images of naked people doing
sexy stuff have been around for a long
time. Although whether an image was
considered pornographic generally
depended on the viewer's cultural
background, European archaeologists were
often the ones claiming that these
images were obscene without
understanding their cultural context.
And people haven't just used explicit
material to get all hot and bothered in
18th century Europe. They also used it
to spread elicit information about
contraception and women's sexual freedom
and to poke fun at the aristocracy. Add
this to the fact that porn was seen as
depraved and you can see why its
creators were often punished with jail
time. But that didn't stop people from
making more. As time went on and
photography and film were invented,
visual porn became super popular. And
these days, the internet is home to more
sexually explicit material than your
great great great great great
grandparents could have ever imagined.
So yes, porn is not new, but what is new
is the sheer amount and accessibility of
it that we get from the internet. And
that comes with some benefits and some
downsides. On the positive side,
consuming porn and even sexy scenes in
regular old TV shows and movies may help
to stigmatize sex and provide people
with a space to explore their sexuality,
especially if information about that
kind of thing isn't available in their
IRL communities. This can be
particularly true for members of the
LGBTQ plus community. Remember how the Q
can stand for questioning? Porn can help
those folks figure out what they find
sexy. In fact, because education about
anything but penis and vagina sex is
hard to come by, young LGBTQ plus people
often learn the nuts and bolts of sex
from porn. Ultimately, everyone's
relationship with porn is different. But
truth be told, porn isn't all fun and
games either. One of the main reasons,
most of it is not realistic. No matter
how amateur the footage looks, the vast
majority of video porn is staged for the
screen, and the people involved are
performers. But that can be hard to
remember if we just accept what happens
in those scenes at face value. It can
lead us to picking up warped ideas about
what sex should look like or what we
should look like. Multiple studies have
found that the usually thin, hairless
women and chiseled dudes in porn can
make young people feel bad about their
bodies, just like airbrushed Instagram
models or gym bro Tik Tockers can. And
when it comes to the experience of sex
in pornographic videos, performers often
fake orgasms because again, they're
performing. What? They fake orgasms? I
mean, I I wouldn't know. I don't watch
porn. Okay. Yeah, TJ. They do fake
orgasms, and this can give viewers the
false idea that everyone's going to
respond the same way to certain sex acts
and make them wonder if something's
wrong with them when it doesn't play out
that way. And one of the most
unrealistic parts of most porn videos is
that they don't talk about the important
stuff. A lot of the time they're just
naked people on a bed and they start
doing stuff. No consent, no
communication about desires, and no
protection. People with penises often
don't wear condoms in porn, let alone
have a conversation about wearing one.
But in reality, talking to each other is
one of the key ways to have good sex.
Many researchers and educators also
raised red flags about the amount of
violence and non-consensual aggression
on popular porn sites, especially
because they can reflect harmful
attitudes about women and especially
women of color. In a 2020 study of over
4,000 porn scenes, 35 to 45% showed
violence with women being the target 97%
of the time. Another study showed that
black women were even more likely than
white women to be shown as the victims
of violence. And black men were shown as
the aggressors more often than white
men. And the thing about the internet is
you don't even have to click on these
videos to see the thumbnails and titles
that use racial stereotypes and
misogyny. Historically, exploitation of
performers has been a major part of the
industry, too. This is a complex issue
that we won't dive into today, but know
that many people who watch porn are
getting more interested in how to do so
ethically. Now, as far as the research
goes, there's no conclusive evidence
about whether watching violent or
misogynistic porn makes someone more
likely to act that way offline. Some
research, including a survey from 2019,
found that respondents who viewed
violent porn were more likely to have
perpetrated sexual violence, but that
doesn't necessarily mean one causes the
other. An emerging research, including
one study that surveyed almost 5,000
American college students, has found
that choking, an act popularized by
video porn and other media like
Euphoria, has increased among young
adults, despite the fact that it's not a
safe thing to do, even when it's
consensual. But long-term research is
also sparse, and different definitions
of porn make it hard to compare
findings. And when it comes to misogyny,
a lot of studies are at odds. Some say
that watching porn is correlated with
having sexist attitudes, while some say
the opposite. Also, scientists still
don't really know what high exposure to
porn does to our brains. If you want to
learn more about the research that does
exist, you can visit our friends over at
Sihow. One way or another, though, porn
is still everywhere. So, what do we do
with that? The key is to think
critically about what we see in porn and
to make smart decisions about it. A
little thing called porn literacy. Porn
literacy is part of sexual literacy, the
critical thinking skills needed to have
good sexual health, and it's not all
that different from media literacy. It
involves a lot of the same concepts and
skills you'd use to identify the biases
behind a news article or figure out if a
photo was made by AI. It also involves
unpacking the assumptions we adopt from
porn so that we don't spread
misinformation or bring harmful
behaviors or ideas into our sex lives.
Like, if you don't see people wearing
condoms or talking about contraception
or STI in porn, what message is that
sending you? So, here are some questions
you can ask yourself when you come
across a piece of pornographic media.
One, how does this make me feel? Two,
what is this trying to get me to think
about sex or people? Three, what about
this might not be true to life? Four,
what's missing from this piece of media?
And five, what sources of information
can I trust about the stuff I'm seeing
here? That last question might be the
trickiest, but it's an important one. We
all know we shouldn't believe everything
you see on the internet, but that is
where we get a lot of our information.
And some online sources are better than
others. Some reference research from
doctors, sex therapists, and scientific
journals, while others, well, you
probably seen some of those Tik Toks.
Also, it's worth noting that these
critical thinking skills don't just
apply to explicit videos. You can use
these questions to analyze any
information about sex you encounter,
from TV and movies to fanfiction and
spicy romance novels, or my personal
favorite medium, audio erotica. Cuz the
thing is, there's nothing wrong with
wanting to explore your sexuality or
responsibly seek out pleasure. But like
anything else, it's important to make
sure we do it in a way that's healthy,
safe, and mindful. Ultimately, not
everybody watches porn on a regular, and
it's certainly not a requirement for a
happy sex life. But for those who enjoy
it, it's important to think critically
about what's being portrayed because in
the end, porn is designed to arouse and
entertain, but it's not meant to
educate. For that, you've got things
like Crash Course. Coming up next, we're
talking all about orgasms. See you then.

UxmD-Lone7A,"What makes someone Native American?
There's a misconception that to be truly
Native, you have to have darker skin and
long hair, dress only in traditional
clothing, and be actively riding a
horse. But Native Americans are also
modern people. We wear suits and jingle
dresses, ride coat, and teach
traditional languages, rock buzzcuts and
braids. We could have an Ojiway mom and
a British dad who passed on his blonde
hair, pale skin, or love of beans on
toast. Basically, you can't tell if
someone's native just by looking. So,
today I'm going to give you the scoop on
what it really means to
be native. Hi, I'm Jay Jim and welcome
to Crash Course Native American
[Music]
History. So, first of all, there's no
single native identity and no single
native culture. Before the land that we
call the United States was a twinkle in
Thomas Jefferson's eye, some native
nations knew this land as Turtle Island,
and it was and is a land of hundreds of
tribes. Each tribe had its own cultural
practices and unique identities with
different spiritual beliefs, languages,
customs, landscapes, rituals, food,
dress, and traditions. You wouldn't get
a quacuto potluck confused with a muscoi
green corn ceremony. That would be like
growing up to single de Mayo in liter
hosen. People look at you funny. Trust
me. I know. We'll begin in 1492 when
Columbus sailed the ocean blue. Whoa.
No. No. We won't. Plus, the Vikings made
it here way before that dweeb. Anyway,
yes. To make an extremely long story
short, European settlers colonized North
America, interrupting native life.
Something we'll talk more about in
episode 10. And like we'll see over and
over throughout this series, native
people are still dealing with the
consequences of colonization, including
when it comes to
identity. Take spirituality. Before
colonization, the hundreds of tribes
scattered throughout what is now the US
had diverse spiritual practices, and
many communities shared the notion that
all living things are related, a part of
a family rather than resources to be
used up. what we native folks call
mitaku oasi, a lot phrase meaning all my
relations. But when the colonists
imported Christianity and those weird
hats to North America, they tended to
see Native Americans as souls in need of
saving. Spiritual practices that had
stretched back for generations were
suddenly disrupted. For instance, the
Puritan John Elliot of the Massachusetts
Bay Colony, nice ascot, tried to convert
American Indians to Christianity. He
even learned the Algangquin language to
do so and it worked. One quarter of
native people in New England converted
to Christianity. Elliot isolated those
who converted into praying towns,
forcing them to cut their hair, dress
like Puritans, and give up their
families and cultural practices. This
created tribal and cultural tensions
between those who converted and those
who didn't. Even within families, when
your community faces a crisis of faith,
what does that do to your cultural
identity? Fast forward to the 21st
century and twothirds of Native
Americans today identify as Christian,
but plenty of Native people still follow
their traditional beliefs and some mix
the two. My own grandma wore her
traditional dress every day. She spoke
fluent Navajo and with the Catholic mass
every week or like at Minnesota's All
Saints Episcopal Indian Mission where
the pastor burns sweetg grass instead of
incense. The organ is swapped for
traditional drum and the congregation
holds annual buffalo roast. And when it
comes to cultural identity, language is
one of the most powerful ways to share
and preserve it. But hundreds of native
languages have been lost since European
contact in part thanks to American
Indian boarding
schools. Starting in the 1870s,
thousands of native children were forced
to attend these government schools and
among many other deeply horrifying
things were forbidden from using their
given names and speaking their
languages. We'll talk a lot more about
these boarding schools later on in this
series, but let's jump forward to the
here and now. If you can't speak your
ancestral language, how might that
affect your connection to your culture?
These are complicated questions, and the
answers can be different for every
native person and tribe. But some
languages are being revived in some
pretty unexpected ways. Come here, tell
your story.
In the 1990s, Jesse Little Do Bayard, a
member of the Machbby tribe of Wampaog
Nation, started having dreams. In them,
familiar-looking people spoke to her in
a language that she didn't understand.
Then one day, when driving in
Massachusetts, she noticed similarities
in the street signs that she was
passing. And it hit her. The people in
her dream were speaking Wampa Naak, the
traditional language of her people. See,
there is this prophecy from back when
her tribe had first met the pilgrims at
Plymouth Plantation. It predicted that
the Wampa Naak language would disappear
and eventually return and the children
of the people who played a role in its
loss would help resurrect it. True to
the prophecy, Wampa Naak hadn't been
spoken since the late 1800s. Bayer took
her dreams as a sign. She worked with
the Machbby and Aquina tribes to launch
a language reclamation project. And
while getting her mers in linguistics
from MIT, she was advised by an expert
in indigenous languages who just so
happened to be a direct descendant of
the white founder of Rhode Island, much
like the prophecy foretold. To bring the
language back to life, she
cross-referenced a Bible that John
Elliot, Asco guy, had translated into a
language similar to Wampa, plus the
dozens of other archival documents from
languages in the same family. From those
scraps, Barrett constructed a 10,000word
Wampa dictionary, began teaching Wampa
classes, and even raised her daughter to
speak the language, making her the first
native speaker in seven
generations. And that is the story of
Jesse Little Dough Beard.
As diverse as native identity can be,
varying from person to person and tribe
to tribe, what's shared is a common
experience of splintered connections to
places, practices, languages, and
more. In fact, colonization changed how
lots of Native people determined what's
known as tribal membership. Like, I'm an
enrolled member of the Navajo Nation.
But not all Native Americans are
enrolled tribal members. Before
colonization, tribes often used descent
to figure out membership. If you were
descended from someone in the tribe or
were adopted or married in, you were
welcomed. We kept it chill. But thanks
to standards imposed by the US
government over the years, things have
shifted for many tribes. Today, each
tribe determines their own enrollment
criteria. For instance, the Cherokee
rely on something called the doll's
roles, lists prepared by the US
government in the late 19th and early
20th centuries to document who was a
member of five specific tribes,
including the Cherokee. But they weren't
perfect. Many people from those tribes
didn't sign up out of fear of
persecution. Also, the doll's roles
limited enrollment to one tribe, even
though many native people claimed
multiple tribal identities. Regardless,
today the only way to become an enrolled
member of the Cherokee Nation is if at
least one of your direct ancestors
signed up for that
list. Elsewhere, the most widely used
way to figure out enrollment eligibility
is to require a particular blood quantum
or fraction of tribal blood. Quantum
blood fractions. Man, this sounds like a
sci-fi thriller. But the amount required
varies between tribes. For example,
someone looking to enroll in the Turtle
Mountain Band of TripleA only needs one
quarter Indian blood regardless of
tribe. But a person seeking to enroll in
the Navajo Nation needs to have at least
one quarter Navajo blood to be accepted.
Thanks, Dad. About 70% of fedally
recognized tribes today require a blood
quantum, but it's a controversial way of
determining tribal enrollment. It's a
practice born out of those early dolls
rolls days back when the US government
was also sorting Native Americans into
mixed or fullblood, aka those with
European ancestry and those without. The
hope in measuring Indianness was that
eventually after generations of
intermarriage, there wouldn't be many
people who qualified as native anymore
and the US would not be held to the
treaties that they signed. That's one
messed up loophole. Many natives today
argue that tribes should leave blood
quantum in the past, reasoning that it's
a colonial invention that treats native
identity like a math problem,
considering younger generations not
native enough. If a child of two
enrolled parents doesn't meet Blood
Quantum, they miss out on the benefits
of tribal citizenship like access to
scholarships, religious protections, and
healthcare, not to mention a sense of
belonging and a cool ID card. And as
fewer people qualify as members, what
will that mean for the tribe's continued
existence? But on the other side, some
native people think blood quantum
requirements are their best shot at
proving a lineage and preserving already
close-knit communities. So, it's up to
each tribe as a sovereign nation to
decide how they want to handle
membership. And some tribes are taking
action, returning to enrollment based on
descendency. In other words, if your
parent is in the tribe, you can be in
it, too. Like the St. Croy TripleA tribe
which voted in 2023 to eliminate blood
quantum requirements. And in case you
were wondering, can a DNA test prove
tribal membership? No. At most, a DNA
test might show someone is related to a
tribal member, but there's no tribe
specific genetic marker that says,
""Congratulations, you're Navajo."" And
although there are some DNA markers more
likely to be found in people with native
ancestry, not all Native Americans have
them. So, next time your white neighbor
tells you they're Mohawk because 23 and
me said so, kindly direct them to this
video. So, Native American identity can
involve being an enrolled tribal member,
but not always. Also, to make things
even more nuanced, not all tribes are
fedally recognized. The US government
chooses which tribes get federal
benefits. Currently, 574 of them, though
there are some occasional updates. Most
benefits and many laws relating to
American Indian identity only apply to
members of those federally recognized
tribes. Additionally, the government
issues certificates of degree of Indian
or Alaskan Native American blood or CDIB
cards. So many cards which entitle
holders to those benefits like access to
Indian health services. All this has a
huge impact on the cultural identity of
a tribe and its people. If a tribe isn't
fedally recognized, some people don't
see it as legitimate. Even if that tribe
has been around since time immemorial
and without recognition, tribes like the
Winnamon Wintu face an even steeper
climb in preserving their cultural
traditions because they lack legal
protections for their religious
practices or the clout to stop
development on their sacred sites. As
for how the federal government decides
who gets recognition, that's complicated
and we'll get there in a later episode.
When it comes to culture, native
identity might involve speaking
traditional languages and dressing in
traditional clothing, or it might not.
When it comes to legal status, identity
might mean being an enrolled member of a
federally recognized tribe or an
unrecognized one, or not an enrolled
member at all. Really, it's not a
one-sizefits-all kind of deal. But if
there's one word I could use to describe
native identity, it's this:
perseverance.
Ever since the first colonizers set foot
on the shores of North America, they've
worked to dilute, restrain, and destroy
native culture. From creating categories
to define us to separating us from our
beliefs, lands, and
languages. But through it all, natives
have persevered. And in that
perseverance, we begun to reclaim what's
been taken from
us. In our next episode, we'll look at
some of the many ways Native Americans
are connected to the land and to each
other. and I will see you then. Thanks

For decades, the former name of the
Washington football team was a source of
anger and frustration for many Native
Americans. Vernon Belcor, a leader of
the American Indian Movement, put it
this way. We welcome all you good
Washington football fans, but we don't
welcome the chicken feathers, the paint,
the cheap Hollywood chance. Leave our
culture, leave our spiritual traditions
alone. But what was the big deal? Didn't
the team name honor Native Americans? Or
is that just a myth? Hi, I'm Jay Jim and
welcome to Crash Course Native American
[Music]
History. For a long time, this is how
Native Americans were commonly
represented. If they weren't out hunting
buffalo, they were gathered around a
table with some pilgrims eating turkey,
mashed potatoes, and cranberry sauce. As
somebody who's worked a lot of retail in
my life, my Thanksgiving meal is usually
what's ever left in the breakroom
fridge. This version of nativeness is
about as nuanced as a brick wall. And it
comes from a variety of myths and
misconceptions that have spread like
wildfire from the colonial era to the
modern day with real concrete
consequences. Take the first
Thanksgiving for instance. Countless
school plays and classroom crafts has
presented it as truth. But the real
story of that meal is a lot more
sinister. But before we get into that,
let me take care of something real
quick. Katie, smashbox,
please. Myths like the first
Thanksgiving are so widespread, fighting
them takes serious work. And that can
take lots of different forms, including
my personal
favorite, myth blasting baseball.
[Music]
Now then, where were we? Oh, yeah, the
first Thanksgiving. So, what actually
happened that day? In 1620, the pilgrims
landed in an untamed
wilderness. Except, wait, this place
wasn't untamed at all. It already had a
name, Puxit, which was also the name of
the band of the Wampenog Confederation,
who had been farming and living there
for generations. But it was a terrible
time for the Wampenon. An epidemic from
a disease brought over by other
Europeans had wiped out up to 90% of
their population, leaving them weak and
vulnerable. Meanwhile, the English
considered all of this God's will and a
great time to take some land. When the
pilgrims arrived in winter, they robbed
the homes and graves of Wampenog, who
died, promising to repay what they'
taken. They didn't. All the while, the
Wampenog leader, Usami, was weighing out
his options as tensions with other
tribes were brewing. He strategically
decided the pilgrims might be good
allies if a war broke out. The Wampaogs
helped the pilgrims make it through the
winter, and the pilgrims did throw a
harvest feast, but they didn't invite
their neighbors. The Wampenogs heard
guns going off and sent 90 men over to
help. Only then were the pilgrims like,
""Oh, you want some food?"" And there
wasn't enough to eat. So, the Wampenogs
went out to hunt some deer. And if there
was friendship that day, it didn't last.
Within a generation, the tension between
Native Americans and English settlers
erupted into King Phillip's War, one of
the deadliest conflicts in US history.
So, while the Thanksgiving myth might
seem like no big deal, it hides a grim
reality that this strategic temporary
alliance kicked off a centuriesl long
disaster for the Wampaogs, who, by the
way, are still here living in New
England. But where did this myth come
from and why? Historians point to a few
different moments like the mid 1700s
when New Englanders sought to establish
themselves as the fathers of America or
the mid 1800s when the US was pushing
further west into Indian territory and
Abraham Lincoln was trying to unify the
country and the reconstruction period
when whites tried to distance the
nation's history from enslavement.
Essentially, the story was passed on for
political reasons, not historically
accurate ones. According to historian
David Silverman, the false narrative of
Thanksgiving creates an emotional burden
for Native Americans and promotes a
light-hearted view of historical trauma.
It contributes the spread of false ideas
like natives and colonizers got along
and Native Americans are a part of the
past. The myth that Native Americans no
longer exist, often called the myth of
the vanishing Indian, couldn't be
further from the truth. I mean, I'm
here, aren't I? In fact, I'm one of
about 6 million natives living in the US
today. Part of the reason why we seem
invisible is because the media has done
a pretty poor job of showing who we
really are. For instance, I remember as
a kid feeling like there was just no
room for people like me in movies. Many
of the most popular films were westerns,
which for a long time were the only ways
Native Americans were represented to the
wider world. These movies made natives
seem synonymous with the Wild West, not
the here and now. something we also
covered in Crash Course Art History. And
this omission of native people from the
present can have some serious
consequences. One survey of more than
6,000 native folks found that 87% of
those surveyed believed the average
American didn't care about native
peoples. That invisibility can cause
mental health issues and minimize the
effects of anti-native racism. Not to
mention the stereotypes that still hang
around today in Thanksgiving plays,
Halloween
costumes, and sports.
Like, have you ever seen the Kansas City
Chiefs or the Atlanta Brave fans doing
this? Yeah. That's called the tomahawk
chop, and it's meant to remind us of the
savage Indian Warriors wielding their
tomahawks at cowboys, just like in those
western films. The tomahawk chop is part
of this culture we have in the US of
using native people as mascots for
sports teams. The myth goes like this.
Using a Native American as a mascot
honors them and the nation's history and
traditions. But just like the
Thanksgiving myth, that's far from the
truth. You know what we need to
[Music]
do? Like I said earlier, Native
Americans aren't just figures from the
past, but mascots like these make us
seem like we are. In fact, many of the
team names that
honor Native Americans came about during
a time when the US government was trying
to assimilate natives out of existence
through forcing them onto reservations
and into boarding schools. White America
was like, ""Boom, colonization done.
Here's a mascot to remember the good
times."" Native mascots don't bring the
average non-native person any closer to
actually understanding native people.
And disrespect aside, there are real
negative effects to that. Studies have
shown that exposure to native
stereotypes decreases young native
people's sense of their own worth and
the worth of their communities and can
increase depression. And sometimes
sports teams use really offensive
language that further harms native
people, like the Washington football
team's old name. Native leaders
protested the name for decades. But
little changed. When controversy bubbled
up in 2014, a Washington football alumni
site made this statement. We believe the
name deserves to stay. It epitomizes the
noble qualities we admire about Native
Americans. The same intangibles we
expect from Washington's grid iron
heroes on game day. Honor, loyalty,
unity, respect, courage, and more. And
listen, I get it. I'm a huge football
fan. But when it comes to the Rword, I
can't help but think about how it's been
used in the past. Back in the mid 1800s,
the Minnesota state government offered
$200 per native killed and used the
Rword to describe well what they wanted
to exchange. So, there's a lot of
controversy about this word. Some
natives saw no problem with it, while
others were offended by it. My take is
this. If you wouldn't say it to an
actual native person, you probably
shouldn't be saying it at all. Susan
Shona Harjo, a Cheyenne and Hodogi
Muscogi activist who spent decades
advocating for the name change has said,
""When I was a girl, you barely could
make it through your young life without
getting attacked by a bunch of white
people."" And they would always go to
that word. To many natives, there's a
fundamental mismatch between the idea of
Indian and the actual lived experience
of being one. And this applies to the
financial lives of native people, too.
Like lots of non-natives think that we
are either rich casino Indians or that
we're poor and lazy and get everything
handed to us. I'll take ironic
contradictions for 400. Let's be real.
Not all tribes own casinos. For those
that do, under a federal law called the
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, tribes can
only use casino profits for certain
things like health care, public safety,
education, and infrastructure projects
and per capita payments to tribal
members. And the vast majority of
casinos don't actually produce much
revenue for
tribes. The whole rich casino Indian
thing is a stereotype that grew out of
'90s TV and popular shows like South
Park and The Sopranos and a growing fear
of natives becoming an economic threat.
Because the thing is to be really
Indian, you need to rely on government
handouts,
right? You know the drill.
As of 2023, natives have the highest
poverty rate of any racial group in the
US. But media critic Celeste Lroy has
pointed out that the casino Indian myth
in particular presents natives as
immoral, scheming, and undeserving of
power and wealth. If people think that
you're part of a get-richqu scheme,
they're not very likely to help you. So,
let's rapidfire myth bust real quick.
Checks from the government. Some natives
do get them, but it's a payment that
they're owed for the use of natural
resources on their land. Taxes. Tribes
don't pay federal taxes because the US
Constitution recognizes them as
sovereign nations, but virtually all
individual natives pay federal income
taxes. College tuition. Most Native
students pay for college through loans,
needs-based grants, and merit-based
scholarships. Same as everybody else.
Only sometimes they can get access to
native specific scholarships. and
state-based tuition waivers if they meet
certain criteria. And those tuition
waivers are slowly increasing the number
of Native Americans who can go to
college and graduate. Besides Indian
Health Services or IHS, a federal agency
that delivers healthcare to nearly 2.6
million American Indians, if a native is
receiving government assistance, it's
not because they're native. It's because
they qualify for the same support open
to any US citizen. IHS itself is a
result of treaty agreements and federal
trust obligations to native people where
the government was like, ""We'll take
your land and then we'll take care of
you."" Sort of. Cuz turns out IHS is
chronically underfunded. On average, IHS
users get less than half of the money
that users of other types of federal
healthcare receive each year. So natives
aren't even getting everything that they
were promised. So what do we do with all
of this? We know that these myths ignore
the violent traumatic history of
colonization and promote stereotypes
about native people. All of which harms
them and their communities and limits a
broader understanding of native people
by
non-natives. But sometimes things do
change. During the racial reckonings of
2020, the threat of major sponsors
pulling out ultimately made the
Washington football team's owner change
his tune and the team was renamed to the
Washington Commanders in 2022. But it
was the advocacy by indigenous folks
like Susan Shon Harjo and Chief Billy
Redwing Tayak that brought the issue
forward in the first place and continued
to fight for
decades. There's time and space to start
swapping out these myths for real
stories of real natives to ditch the
native stereotypes in whatever way you
know
how. Next time we'll learn about Native
American identity and just how
complicated it can be. I will see you
then. Thanks for watching this episode

oPFP9SZnoRs,"You can feel it. They're into you.
You're into them. And you are ready to
swan dive into the deep, passionate
waters of doing it. But wait, how do you
know you both want to have sex? Like,
for sure, consent seems straightforward.
You both want to do it or you don't. But
sometimes there's more going on behind a
simple yes or no. So, let's unpack
consent together. Hi, I'm Shamboo and
this is Crash Course Sex.
[Music]
Heads up, in today's episode, we'll be
talking about sexual assault. So, please
keep that in mind and take care when
watching. The legal definition of
consent varies by state. So, when we
talk about consent in this episode,
we're talking about an agreement between
people to engage in mutually enjoyable
sexual activity together. And it wasn't
that long ago that consent was taught as
no means no. But that's not all there is
to it. Because saying nothing isn't the
same as saying yes. Silence can also
mean uncertainty or discomfort, much
like in the rest of life. To use a
non-sexy example, if my neighbor's kid
shows up at my house selling celebrity
garden gnomes, I might not respond at
first, not because I want a Snoop Dog
garden gnome, but because I'm baffled
that this is even a thing. Either way,
that kid should not shove a garden gnome
into my hands. The same is true for sex.
Just because someone doesn't say no
doesn't always mean they're saying yes.
So some college students decided to
change things up. After a number of
sexual assaults at Antioch College in
Yellow Springs, Ohio, a feminist student
group was fed up. So in 1990, they
pitched a different way of thinking
about consent. Not as no means no, but
as yes means yes. In other words, the
absence of a no is not the same thing as
a yes. Kissing, grinding, or even, well,
we've had sex before is not an automatic
yes. And if someone is sleeping or
unconscious, they cannot say yes. Also,
consent to one kind of touch isn't
consent to another. Each new action
needs its own yes. Antioch College
formally adopted the students ideas and
created the first ever affirmative
consent policy. But when the news hit
the wider culture, this idea was framed
as ludicrous by media outlets from
Saturday Night Live to the New York
Times. Many people could not imagine
asking, ""Can I kiss you?"" as anything
but a buzzkill. But over time,
affirmative consent went mainstream.
Many colleges, companies, and
governments saw the need for yesbased
policies, and a handful of US states
began using the affirmative definition
of consent in their laws. Recently,
movements like me too have made it clear
how important this definition is. And
these days, consent is widely taught as
yes means yes. I see you student
activists. Affirmative consent clears up
a lot of confusion whether someone is
with a new partner, in a long-term
relationship, or anything in between.
Because even if you've been with someone
forever, that doesn't mean you have to
want sex whenever your partner does.
Maybe you want to cool it on collecting
celebrity guard gnomes for a bit. And
also, affirmative consent clarifies that
just because someone wants sex doesn't
mean they're saying yes to actually
having sex. It's possible to be sexually
aroused but not actually consent to
doing it right here, right now for any
number of reasons. But there are a
couple of other huge reasons affirmative
consent is so powerful. And they have to
do with sexual assault. Often someone
experiencing assault can't say no
because of something called freeze mode.
An involuntary physical response when a
person can't move or speak. Freeze is
fight orflight's lesserk known cousin.
Another way the nervous system responds
to a threat. And it's a major reason why
the absence of a no has never been a
reliable sign of consent. And then
there's the fact that someone's body can
have an involuntary physiological
reaction during non-consensual sex, such
as erection or orgasm, which doesn't
imply they're okay with what's
happening. Physical response does not
equal consent. All of this is why when I
teach about consent, I encourage people
to look for an enthusiastic yes. The
only way to be absolutely sure your
partner is on board with what's
happening is to ask. Try a clarifying
question or two, like, ""How are you
feeling?"" or ""Do you want to slow things
down?"" And here's the thing, context is
also super important. It's not just
about the yes, but about all the
circumstances around it. A yes is only
consensual if it's freely given. No
pressure or manipulation attached. But
here's where things can get complicated.
Cultural norms and expectations can make
someone feel like they have to say yes,
even if they don't want to. Let's test
off a sexual script we talked about back
in episode 6. It's a set of expectations
that cast people in certain roles based
on their gender. And it goes a little
something like this. Men are confident
and take control. They want and initiate
sex. It's a woman's job to be sexy, but
not too sexual and to accept sex or turn
it down. But according to this script,
they're also supposed to be nice and
accommodating and not hurt anyone's
feelings. We might not all comfortably
fit into these gender roles, but culture
is strong. And research shows that much
like glitter, that stuff sticks. While
the numbers vary, some surveys have
found that more than 20% of sexually
active college women have had at least
one sexual experience they didn't want,
including times when they said yes to
please their partner or because their
partner pressured them. And in another
study, college men reported having
unwanted sex, too, when they said yes to
sex because they thought they were
supposed to. that they'd be mocked if as
a guy they turned out a chance to sleep
with someone. These scripts can lead to
a yes that isn't really a yes. Nobody
wants to get pressured into buying a
Post Malone garden no. On top of gender
norms, consent can also get messy when
there's a power imbalance in a
relationship. Imagine a student who says
yes to sex with a professor because they
worry a no could put their grades at
risk. Or a person in an unhealthy
relationship who says yes because they
fear the consequences of making their
partner mad if they say no. These yeses
are not freely given, so they're not
truly consensual. Or imagine someone
who's had a few drinks. One is someone
too intoxicated to say yes and mean it.
In the moment, it's not always clear. If
you start drinking, it can be hard to
tell when you're too drunk to make good
choices. Like in one 2023 study,
researchers interviewed multiple pairs
of tailgators where each person had an
average of four to five drinks. Most
tailgators said if the opportunity
arose, they themselves were not too
intoxicated to consent to sex. But if
their tipsy friend wanted to have sex
right now, women were more likely to be
like, ""Girl, no."" Even though they'd had
about the same amount to drink. This
isn't to say that consent can only
happen when you're 100% sober. But when
alcohol is in the mix, it's especially
important to check in with your partner,
asking things like, ""What do you want to
do now? Do you need a break?"" And, ""Are
you sure you want to purchase 75 Selena
Gomez garden gnomes?"" And don't forget,
check in with yourself, too. Do I like
this? Do I still want this? If the
answer isn't yes, it's time to stop.
Now, to be clear, real enthusiastic
consent isn't some mythical thing like a
working ice cream machine at McDonald's.
It happens all the time, every day. But
saying yes to sex or any kind of
physical intimacy is a decision that can
get muddied by culture, power, and
alcohol. So, it's worth paying attention
not just to what someone says, but to
the whole picture. Are they being
pressured into saying yes? Did they say
yes to touching here or just there? And
no matter how far you've gone, a yes can
always turn into a no. I promise. The
purpose of all of this is not to make
consent feel like a bunch of hoops you
got to jump through. It's to make sure
sex is a good time for everyone. That
it's fun, pleasurable, joyful. Consent
isn't just a safeguard against a bad
time. It's the gateway to a really great
time. And research backs this up.
Studies show a close link between sexual
satisfaction and consent, which makes
sense because behind an enthusiastic
yes, there are all kinds of good
feelings going on. Like, I feel
comfortable with you. I like this. I
want this. I'm buying this Samuel L.
Jackson gnome, and I have the perfect
place to put it. What is it with you and
the garden gnomes? Teen Chan, don't
knock it till you have a garden to put
it in. Okay. Also, phrases like, ""Can I
do this to you?"" or I want you to do
that to me. These are ways of
confidently owning what you want. And no
matter what sexual scripts tell you,
it's totally okay to express what you
want and that you want it or that you're
not into something. In that case, you
can say things like, ""I don't want to
have sex, but I do want to make out or I
like you, but this isn't what I want
right now."" Or simply, ""Let's stop. This
doesn't feel right."" Consent is a
lifelong practice, not something you
learn once in sex and forget about and
not something you only talk about at the
start of a relationship. It's something
we should always be practicing. And it's
a path to better sex. More joy, more
pleasure, and more trust and respect for
your partner and yourself, which is
pretty hot if you ask me. Next time
we're talking all about porn. See you
there. This episode of Crash Course

YkG_b02j3eo,"There was a time before the spoken word.
It took billions of years of life on
Earth before the fish-like organisms
from which we evolved developed lungs
and a movable tongue, which would prove
to be kind of important for human
speech. So, we learned to speak and
share our ideas. And then, I'm skipping
over here a lot. Don't at me, Hank. We
learned to write. Writing let us put
ideas down and exchange thoughts with
people who weren't in our immediate
vicinity. But for a long time access to
the written word and by extension access
to ideas was very limited. Paper was
expensive. There were political
interests served by limiting who could
read and write. And then came the
printing press which dramatically
increased not only access to knowledge
but also knowledge production. Then
there were newspapers and pamphlets.
Then broadcasting the radio, the TV and
then well let's see what's inside my
friend the secret compartment. Oh would
you look at that? It's a floppy disc.
Only we didn't have any floppy discs, so
we got these floppy disc coasters.
Anyway, then there was the internet,
which I probably don't need to tell you
changed everything about how we
communicate for better and for worse.
But at its very best, the explosion of
information now available on the
internet can be used to make knowledge
more accessible. It can make different
perspectives more accessible. It can
remind us that how things are now is not
how they always were or how they will
always be. And that's what we're trying
to do here at Crash Course. Like in the
last year, we released a series on
religions, exploring how a variety of
religions respond to life's greatest
mysteries. We also made political
theory, a series that zooms way out,
considering how questions first raised
millennia ago, can provide new lenses
for understanding our world now. Then
there's sex ed, which trades shame for
science, sociology, and stories, helping
learners build deeper knowledge about
their bodies, their health, and
themselves. And we're launching an
in-depth series on Native American
history, which begins well before 1492
and extends into the present. So, yeah,
we've been tackling a lot at Crash
Course recently, and no matter the
series, we're committed to a couple
things. It's going to be free and it's
going to be highquality, meaning
accurate and fact-checked, but also
engaging and fun because we're trying to
make the best version of information
post floppy disc on the internet. And
that means welcoming as many people in
as we can. It's an ambitious goal and if
I'm being honest, an expensive one. Each
video is worked on by over 20 people who
are absolutely devoted to quality. From
subject matter experts to writers,
editors, producers, animators, hosts,
the list goes on and on. Ultimately, the
goal of Crash Course is attainable
because of one very important reason,
and that's you. Each year, we produce a
new Crash Course coin, and each coin
that people like you purchase helps us
reach thousands of learners. And
together, our reach continues to grow.
Like recent research from the American
Historical Association shows Crash
Course is used in classrooms in every
state, even more so than a number of
federally funded educational resources.
This year, the coin design is inspired
by access to information, represented in
historical flash points from the
printing press to the advent of the
internet. The design represents our
mission to provide free access to good
information that's easy and fun to
learn. And that's a mission you join
when you purchase a Crash Course Coin.
These beautiful objects are minted in
Arkansas from hand engraved dyes at
Shire Post Mint. And for $100, you can
help us reach 2,000 learners and receive
a beautiful nickel coin. For $500, you
can help us reach 10,000 learners with a
brass one. And for those able to give
$1,000, you can help us reach 20,000
learners and receive a colored titanium
coin, which includes a unique
handstamped number and a signed thank
you card from me and my brother Hank.
The thank you card, by the way, is made
at Noteworthy Printing in Missoula on an
antique letter press, not unlike the
ones used to print the first books in
the 15th century. For the first time
this year, we're offering a limited
edition premium silver coin for $5,000.
In addition to helping us reach a
100,000 learners, you'll adopt a week of
Crash Course, meaning you'll get a
report made just for you about who has
been watching Crash Course and all of
the learning that you made possible.
This is our fifth year of the Crash
Course Coin, and we know some folks are
collectors. So, this year we've added a
collector's plaque where you can display
your coins, whether you're just starting
your collection or you've been getting
all the available coins every year. We
are really honored to do this work. I
think of Crash Course as one of the most
meaningful projects I've ever been a
part of. Your purchase of the coin at
any level allows us to create some of
the best possible educational resources
and make them accessible anytime,
anywhere. We take that responsibility
very seriously, and I can't say enough
how grateful we are for your support.
The 2025 Crash Course Coins are only
available until June 2nd, and we've only
made a limited quantity. So go to
crashcoursecoin.com now or check the
description for a link and help us keep
Crash Course free for everyone forever.
Thank you."
JDixrkU1pp4,"Abortion is a charged topic, 
with strong opinions all around.
And it also involves complex personal 
decisions. But knowing what abortion is  
is a key part of any comprehensive sex ed course.
We won’t get too deep into the politics or 
legal situation surrounding abortion today,  
because those factors are ever-changing.
But we will shine a light on what’s true 
about abortions, and who gets them.
Hi! I’m Shan Boodram and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
Head’s up: in today’s episode, we’ll be talking 
about sensitive topics, including miscarriages,  
and why people get abortions. So please keep 
that in mind and take care when watching.
When people talk about abortion, they’re 
usually referring to the medical process  
that ends a pregnancy. That’s called an 
induced abortion, and that’s our focus today.
But there’s also spontaneous abortions. That’s 
the medical term for a miscarriage, when someone’s  
body terminates a pregnancy on its own before the 
20th week. A spontaneous abortion might require  
some of the same medical care used in induced 
abortions, but it depends on the specific case.
A healthcare provider can share 
more information if you need it,  
and you can learn more about why 
miscarriages happen in Episode 9.
We’ll be referring to cisgender 
women a lot in this episode,  
since that’s who most of the research 
and discussion focuses on, but trans  
folk may also need pregnancy and reproductive 
health care services, including abortions.
Now when it comes to induced abortions, 
there are two main ways they can happen.  
The first is by taking medication: 
two kinds of pills over two days,  
that are prescribed by a doctor or 
another licensed healthcare provider.
The first pill stops a pregnancy from developing 
further, and the second pill empties the uterus.  
A medical abortion can happen entirely at 
home or partially at a doctor’s office,  
and it can happen up to 10 or 11 weeks after 
the first day of someone’s last period.
The second kind is an in-clinic abortion, 
when a doctor uses light suction to empty  
the uterus. While the clinic visit may take 
longer, the procedure itself usually lasts 10  
minutes or less, and can happen up to 14 
to 16 weeks after someone’s last period.
There’s also another version of in-clinic 
abortion that can happen up to 24 weeks  
after someone’s last period, which can be a 
little more involved and take a bit longer.
These kinds of abortions are 
significantly less common, though.
In 2021, about ninety-three percent of abortions 
in the U.S. happened in the first thirteen weeks  
of pregnancy, according to the CDC. And less 
than one percent happened after twenty-one weeks.
As far as safety goes, surveys have found 
that when abortions are done under the care  
of a trained medical provider, 
they rarely have complications.
A 2015 study that looked at 
data from more than 50,000  
patients reported that complications 
happen in about two percent of cases.
Like we’ll say many times during this 
episode, though, every pregnancy and  
every person is unique. And if you’d like 
to learn more about any of these procedures,  
you can find more information in the description.
Teen Shan: So, who gets abortions? And why?
Good questions! The short answer 
is… well, there is no short answer.
The Guttmacher Institute, which has been 
tracking this kind of data since the late 1960s,  
estimates that just under a quarter of women in 
the U.S. will have an abortion before they’re 45.  
This number is lower than it was in the past, 
and researchers point to a variety of reasons  
for that, like better contraception 
use and fewer teenagers having sex.
But that estimate of just under a quarter of U.S. 
women represents millions of people. And when you  
ask that big of a group of people why they might 
do anything, you’re gonna get a huge variety of answers.
One of the most widely-referenced 
studies that’s been done about  
abortion is called the Turnaway Study. 
It started collecting data in 2008,  
and surveyed hundreds of women about their 
experiences with abortion, over multiple years.
As part of that study, about 950 women 
shared why they were seeking abortions.  
And forty percent of them said it 
was at least partly for financial  
reasons — either in general, or because 
of specific reasons like unemployment.
Meanwhile, about twenty percent of study 
participants said they were seeking an abortion  
because having a child would interfere with 
their school, work, or other life opportunities.  
And just under thirty percent said it was because 
they had to focus on their other children.
And when it comes to that last point, 
about already having kids — a 2021  
review by the CDC looked at data 
from over half a million abortions,  
and found that sixty percent of 
those patients were already parents.
Someone might also have multiple 
reasons for getting an abortion.
And some of them might have nothing to do with 
finances, family, or their living situation.
Notably, some people — including about 110 women 
from that Turnaway Study — sought abortions for  
medical reasons. They might have a health 
condition that makes pregnancy dangerous  
for them, or problems might come up during the 
pregnancy that affect them, the fetus, or both.
So, there are a lot of variables here 
— and there can be a lot of emotions.  
These are often complicated, heavy 
decisions. And while the data shows  
that most abortions are to end unintended 
pregnancies, that isn’t always the case.
One 2015 study reported that about four 
percent of abortions in the U.S. end a  
pregnancy that was intentional 
but had medical complications.
Teen Shan: I see what you mean about the 
whole “there’s no short answer” thing.
Mhmm, exactly. When it comes to mental health, 
surveys have found that getting an abortion  
affects different people in different ways. 
(You might notice a trend happening here.)  
And this is also something that researchers 
from the Turnaway Study have looked into.
As a part of that larger project, they 
recruited more than 600 women who’d  
received abortions. And with their permission, 
they called them twice a year for five years,  
to ask what emotions they were 
feeling about their decision.
Overall, the team found that no 
matter how the women felt at first,  
nearly everyone’s emotions — both positive and 
negative — were less intense after two years.
And after half a decade, at least 
ninety-seven percent of women  
reported that getting an abortion 
was the right decision for them,  
even if they also said it had been 
a hard decision to make at the time.
As a reminder, though, while data can shed some 
light on how a group of people can feel, and  
can be great for understanding the big picture, 
it also can’t tell you how everyone will feel.
Like, in the Turnaway Study, about half of the 
women said that deciding to have an abortion  
was very or somewhat difficult — and the other 
half reported that it wasn’t a hard decision.
Like we’ve said, every pregnancy, 
and every person, is unique.
Now, when it comes to abortion access — at 
the time we’re filming this, in October 2024,  
the legal situation in the U.S. is complicated.
With a case called Roe v. Wade, the 
Supreme Court ruled in the 1970s  
that the Constitution protected 
a person’s right to an abortion.
But that ruling was overturned in 2022, and now,  
abortion access is largely up to individual 
states. And even when laws aren’t in limbo,
it’s also something activists 
— and your local politicians,  
and your neighbors, and your third cousin 
on Instagram — are often vocal about.
With all these beliefs swirling around, 
you might’ve heard that there's
two camps when it comes to abortion: those 
who argue that abortion should be banned,  
and those who argue that legal 
abortion should be available.
But if you dig into the research, what people 
actually think about abortion is much more  
complex, because it sits right at the crossroads 
of law, philosophy, religion, and science.
Kind of like how cats find a way to sit 
right in the middle of whatever you’re doing.
Since 1995, the Pew Research Center has kept 
track of data on what Americans think about  
abortion. And while those numbers 
have varied a bit over the years,  
the number of Americans who think 
abortion should be legal in all or  
most cases is usually above fifty percent. 
As of 2024, it was sixty-three percent.
Teen Shan: Wait, what does 
“all or some cases” mean?
Way to think critically about data, Teen Shan!
So in 2022, the folks at Pew 
dug a little deeper into this,  
and found there’s a lot going on under 
that “all or most cases” umbrella.
Things like how long a woman has been pregnant,  
whether the pregnancy threatens her health, and 
the circumstances of how she got pregnant — like,  
whether or not the sex was consensual or not
— affected a lot of people’s answers.
Overall, only about nineteen percent 
of participants supported the idea that  
abortion should be legal in all cases, and 
eight percent said it should be illegal in  
all cases. But a whopping seventy-one percent 
answered with some version of “it depends.”
Here’s where that leaves us today. 
Abortion will continue to be debated,  
and attitudes and laws will keep evolving, 
too. We hope this data about what happens  
and why helps you understand this 
big, complex topic a little better.
Next time, we’re talking 
about consent. See you then.

GgzR-RSfc9U,"This is the story of a nation that,
according to the United States, doesn’t exist.
Let me explain.
The members of the Chinook Indian 
Nation were skilled fishers,
using nets called seines to rein in
salmon they would often use for trade.
They honored the first salmon 
run of the year with rituals, 
where they cooked and ate the fish
before returning their bones to the Columbia River
in what’s now Oregon and Washington state.
In fact, the Chinook still 
practice the First Salmon Ceremony. 
Their culture is alive and well.
But to the U.S. federal government?
There is no Chinook Indian Nation.
Hi, I’m Che Jim and welcome to
Crash Course Native American History.
[THEME MUSIC]
Five hundred seventy-four.
That’s how many federally 
recognized Native nations 
exist today in what’s now 
known as the United States.
And knowing that can feel a bit…disorienting. 
I mean, that’s more than ten 
times the number of U.S. states.
Wouldn’t it make more sense to just 
call them tribes, instead of “nations”?
It’s not wrong to say tribe, and many Native folks
use the two words interchangeably.
But there’s a good reason to 
use nation in this episode.
We say “nations” when talking 
about the relationship 
between tribal governments and the United States
because of what they have in 
common, and that’s sovereignty —
an inherent, pre-existing right to
govern themselves and their territory.
Meaning, essentially, to make 
and enforce their own laws.
Sovereignty is the basis of a 
government-to-government relationship, 
like the one between the U.S. and Mexico.
It’s how treaties get interpreted, 
Supreme Court cases get decided, 
laws get legislated, and policies get…policied?
And you really can’t understand Native history
— or the present, for that matter —
without first understanding what 
sovereignty means in action.
Native nations like the 
Chinook were running themselves 
long before the United States existed.
In fact, the Chinook fed and 
sheltered Lewis and Clark 
when they came a-surveying 
the land that was not theirs.
So sovereignty isn’t something 
the U.S. ever gave these nations.
The U.S. recognizes tribal sovereignty,
which didn’t just end with colonization.
It’s right there in the Constitution, 
in a totally chill bit called 
the Indian Commerce Clause:
[COLONIAL CARL]
“The Congress shall have power
…to regulate commerce with foreign nations, 
and among the several states, 
and with the Indian Tribes.”
[record scratch]
[CHE] Did you catch it? It’s…subtle.
But by saying Congress can regulate trade
with other sovereign governments,
it’s acknowledging that Native 
nations are among those governments.
And they’ll be treated that way.
Not as special-interest groups.
Not as random individuals.
But as equally sovereign nations.
And if that wasn’t enough,
— spoiler: it definitely wasn’t enough —
the government formally 
recognized Native sovereignty 
again in the early 1800s, 
with the Marshall Trilogy.
Which sounds like a sci-fi franchise,
but it’s actually a series of Supreme Court cases
that say the federal government, not the states,
makes the policies about Native nations.
I'm lookin’ at you Georgia - 
don't make me come down there.
The grand finale of the Marshall trilogy, 
Worcester v. Georgia in 1832, 
brought us this classic:
[COLONIAL CARL]
“Tribes are distinct,  
independent, political communities,
retaining their original natural 
rights, as the undisputed 
possessors of the soil, from time immemorial.”
[CHE]
Got a real ring to it.
But the same case that recognized Native
sovereignty also reined it in,
by classifying tribes as 
“domestic dependent nations.”
“Domestic” meaning they’re 
within the borders of the U.S.,
“dependent” because the federal government has 
both responsibility toward 
them and power over them,
and “nations” because that inherent right
to govern themselves never actually went away.
And if you’re thinking, “Wow, that sounds
like a completely unique, complicated,
and contradictory pretzel of a situation?”
Yes, hello, welcome. It is.
The whole “domestic dependent nations” thing 
made Native sovereignty look 
more like… “quasi-sovereignty”.
Congress now had plenary 
power over Native nations, 
or the broad ability to limit 
or enhance tribal authority.
They could basically decide if the U.S. government 
would treat Native tribes as nations 
or not, on a case-by-case basis.
And that had big consequences for the Chinook
— who I mentioned earlier – along with many  
other tribes.
Remember, tribal sovereignty is an inherent right.
So the Chinook were never not sovereign.
But they needed federal recognition in order
to actually act as a sovereign nation.
But one thing that can help a 
tribe’s case for federal recognition 
is if they entered into a treaty with the U.S.
— which several Chinook tribes did in 1851.
These treaties were overseen by the Oregon
Superintendent of Indian Affairs
and then shipped off to the Senate and tabled.
That Congressional dismissal would be a
major factor in the long fight for recognition
of the Chinook Indian Nation’s sovereignty.
And Congress’s power doesn’t stop there.
They can also terminate a nation’s federally 
recognized status and with it 
their ability to self-govern.
Which happened to the 
Chinook when they were listed 
as one of the terminated federal tribes
in the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act,
which took effect in 1956.
We’ll talk much more about 
termination later in this series.
As processes for federal recognition 
changed over the decades, 
the Chinook tried and failed to gain theirs back.
And between 2001 and 2002,
they were even successful,
on the basis that one of the 
treaties had been ratified.
But George W. Bush’s administration
reversed that decision just after eighteen months.
It was a huge loss for the tribe—
but not the end of their fight for recognition.
So why is tribal sovereignty such a big deal? 
Well, in the United States today, Native nations,
the federal government, and the states
are the only three political 
entities that have sovereignty.
Being recognized by the federal government
means Native nations can make their own laws
and govern their own citizens.
And they can set their own rules 
for who’s considered a citizen.
Recognized sovereignty also means
Native nations can enforce their own laws
and run their own court systems.
They can police their own borders 
and regulate trade within them,
which can create jobs and drive economic growth.
Native nations can also provide services
geared toward the welfare of their citizens,
like healthcare and first responders.
Like, the federal government 
funds the Indian Health Service,
which provided vaccines during the 
early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
But members of non-federally recognized Nations, 
like the Chinook, don’t have full 
access to the IHS or its resources.
So some tribal members had to 
travel hours to get vaccinated.
And importantly, federally recognized nations
have authority over how their lands get used.
A lot of tribal lands are owned by the federal
government and held in trust for the tribe,
but tribes themselves have the final word
on much of what happens to those lands
— and states can’t meddle in the matter.
And this includes things like hunting, 
fishing, and gathering rights.
Without federal recognition, the Chinook
don’t have clear fishing rights to the salmon
that are such a big part of 
their culture and history.
That means they have to pay for 
fishing licenses just like anyone else, 
even though they have an 
ancestral connection to the fish.
Recognized sovereignty also means being
able to collect taxes from tribal citizens,
and non-citizens conducting 
business on tribal lands.
States can’t tax Native nations or tribal members,
but in a strange loophole, if a non-Indian buys
a coffee at a tribal-owned gas station,
the state can collect sales 
taxes off that purchase.
Isn’t the legal system fun?
By and large, recognized sovereignty means
Native nations can handle their own business,
without interference from the states.
But Native nations and states 
sometimes enter into agreements, 
government-to-government, to 
work together on certain issues.
Like, if a nation wants to open a casino,
they have to enter into a compact with the state
where that casino will be located.
Or if the child of an enrolled tribal 
member needs to enter foster care, 
the nation and the state 
will often share resources.
At the end of the day, 
sovereignty means Native nations
are better able to pass on their traditions,
maintain their cultural identities,
preserve their languages,
and determine their own futures.
And without federal recognition,
all of that becomes a whole lot harder.
But even when the federal government
acknowledges a tribe’s sovereignty,
it can still have a lot of control.
State laws may not be enforced in Indian Country.
But Congress can give states 
some power over tribal affairs, 
in ways that diminish Native sovereignty.
And it’s done so before —
without consulting Native nations first.
For example, in 1953, Congress 
enacted Public Law 280,
which gave state law enforcement control 
they didn’t previously have 
on Native lands in six states:
Alaska, California, Minnesota,
Nebraska, Oregon, and Wisconsin.
Before that, Native nations handled 
minor crimes on reservations, 
and the federal government 
dealt with any major crimes.
But after PL 280 passed —
again, without Native consent —
the nations suddenly shared criminal 
jurisdiction with the state, 
which limited tribes’ authority 
to deal with minor crimes.
On top of that, Native nations 
in those states were suddenly 
disqualified from federal 
funding to run their own courts.
It’s that congressional power 
to rein in Native governance 
that makes their sovereignty a bit of a…gray area.
Even though federally recognized 
tribes are sovereign nations… 
they can’t do a lot of the things 
we’d associate with nations.
Like, the Navajo Nation cannot go to war, 
sign an international trade 
treaty, or make its own currency.
And the U.S. has a habit of disrespecting
the sovereignty that Native nations do have.
Both before and after the Constitution recognized 
tribal sovereignty, colonists 
and the U.S. government
actively undermined it by killing 
and displacing Native people, 
taking Native land, and trying to get 
rid of Native cultures altogether.
As we’ll see throughout this series,
that lack of respect for tribal sovereignty
had some dire consequences for Native people
that we’re still dealing with today.
So where does that leave us — and where
does it leave the Chinook Indian Nation?
Well, in 2017, the Chinook 
filed a suit against the 
Department of the Interior and 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs
claiming that they deserved 
to be federally acknowledged.
But, as of this filming in 
2024, it hasn’t happened…yet.
The Chinook Indian Nation is still pursuing
every pathway it can to regain their recognition.
Regardless of recognition, 
the right of Native nations 
to govern themselves has 
existed since time immemorial.
It wasn’t a gift the U.S. gave to these tribes.
It’s something that Native nations already had —
an inherent right that didn’t cease to exist
when their lands were colonized.
And today, Native sovereignty is the basis of a
government-to-government relationship,
a nation-within-a-nation situation that is…
to say the least…complicated.
We’ll keep exploring it a whole 
lot more throughout this series.
Next time, we’ll talk about some of the scariest
myths and misconceptions about Native Americans.
And I’ll see you then.

szwo6bqpwwE,"extreme breast tenderness, excess hair
growth, aching teeth. These are just
some of the things I had to deal with
when I was pregnant. And we're only
scratching the surface of the list. And
I'm not going to lie though, some of the
hair growth was nice. Yes, this is all
mine. Most sex focuses on how not to get
pregnant. But what if you are or a want
to be someday? I can tell you there was
so much I never knew about pregnancy and
birth until another human being was
literally growing inside of my body.
Hi, I'm Shamboo, birther of two babies,
and this is Crash Course Sex
[Music]
Ed. All right, let's start with getting
pregnant. Once a month during ovulation,
an ovary releases an egg, which stays in
the fallopian tube for about 12 to 24
hours. And if a sperm doesn't come by
through PNV sex or artificial
insemination, the egg calls it quits.
The uterus sheds the lining. It prepared
for a fertilized egg contracts to get
all that lining out and boom, period
cramps. Now, sperm can survive around 5
days in the fallopian tubes, camping out
in case an egg shows up. So, if someone
with a uterus has unprotected sex,
either on ovulation day or up to 5 days
before it, that's when they have the
highest chance of getting pregnant. This
is called the fertile window, and it
varies from body to body. Many people
try for months or even years to get
pregnant for lots of reasons. Menstrual
cycles aren't always easy to track, and
age is a big factor. Everyone's
fertility decreases as we get older.
Sperm health and mobility are also
important when it comes to getting
pregnant. But let's say that everything
goes swimmingly. What next? The egg gets
fertilized by the sperm and then makes
its way to the uterus. During this
journey, there's a risk of the egg
getting stuck, causing an ectopic
pregnancy, aka any pregnancy that
develops outside the uterus. About 2% of
pregnancies are ectopic and they require
immediate medical attention. Ideally
though that fertilized egg travels into
the uterus and embeds itself into the
nice cozy endometrial tissue. This is
called implantation and it might come
with cramping and very light bleeding.
Sometimes though implantation doesn't
happen for any number of reasons. The
egg might not be viable because of
things like genetic abnormalities or
uterine scarring from medical conditions
might make it harder for the egg to
attach. Research shows about half of all
fertilized eggs don't implant. And it's
estimated that 10 to 20% of known
pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is
the loss of pregnancy before the 20th
week. After week 20, it's referred to as
a still birth. Most miscarriages happen
because the fetus simply wasn't
developing properly. But despite the
fact that miscarriages are common and a
natural part of the reproductive
process, there's still a lot of shame
and stigma around pregnancy loss. The
truth is, miscarriages can be
devastating, so there's no room to add
any unnecessary shame to the experience.
All right, back to it. If everything
keeps moving forward, that fertilized
egg will divide in two parts. One
becomes an embryo and eventually a
fetus, and one becomes a placenta. The
placenta is a temporary organ attached
to the uterine wall on one side and the
fetus on the other. Everything the fetus
needs goes from the parents bloodstream
through the placenta, down the umbilical
cord, and to the fetus. Pregnant people
are out here growing a whole life
support
system. The placenta produces its own
specialized hormones, too. HCG thickens
the uterine lining and stops menration,
while HPL prepares the body for
breastfeeding and helps the fetus get
nutrients. Those definitely aren't the
only hormonal changes, though. Estrogen
and progesterone levels also go up, and
lots of other specialized hormones start
swirling around, and that has an effect
on pretty much everything. A typical
pregnancy is about 40 weeks divided into
three trimesters. And the symptoms start
right off the bat. The first trimester
is when all the fetus's major body
systems and organs are forming. So most
pregnant folks feel exhausted. And
really everything that happens when
someone is pregnant is sort of hijacking
their system for the benefit of the
fetus. Take morning sickness, which can
actually happen at any time of day.
Experts think it might be a protective
adaptation. If you feel sick, you're
going to avoid food and other substances
that might be harmful to the fetus. Did
knowing that make me feel any better
about the 20 straight weeks that I felt
like I was in a dinghy and choppy
waters? Not so much. Breasts might be
painful because hormones are causing
them to grow and swell and all the ducts
inside are preparing to produce milk for
breastfeeding. And a pregnant person's
feet might even grow because a hormone
called relaxin makes ligaments
stretchier to prepare the pelvis to
expand during birth. Meanwhile, the
labia may also increase in size and the
vulva, vagina, and cervix may change
color because of increased blood flow.
And speaking of blood flow, get this. If
you get pregnant, your blood volume
significantly increases, sometimes as
much as doubling. This can lead to nose
bleeds, and this is the reason why a
pregnant person's nose might look
bigger, too. Maybe Pinocchio wasn't a
liar after all. I remember feeling so
shocked by a lot of these symptoms.
American culture tends to be pretty
heavy on the whole motherhood is a gift
thing and doesn't leave a lot of room
for the messy reality, but knowing what
to expect when expecting can make all
the difference. And luckily, lots of the
worst symptoms subside by the second
trimester. If you're pregnant, you'll
likely start to feel the fetus move
about 16 to 20 weeks in, which can be a
magical moment. What's less magical is
that your rib cage expands and your
uterus grows, pushing aside other
organs. That's why it may feel harder to
catch your breath in later pregnancy,
why you got to pee all the time, and why
you can't eat large meals. Everything is
just squished. Finally, in the last few
weeks of the third trimester, the fetus
drops lower into the pelvis, and the
process of getting that baby out begins.
There are three stages of childirth, and
it takes a lot longer than it looks in
the movies. The first stage is usually
the longest, and it's divided into early
labor and active labor. Early labor can
take hours or even days. It's when the
uterus starts squeezing to push the baby
down into the cervix. Those are
contractions. The cervix begins to thin
and also opens or dilates to around 6 cm
and the body starts clearing out some of
the protections it built for the fetus.
Like the cervix forms a protective
covering of mucus to make sure nothing
harmful gets in. This is called a mucus
plug and it can be loosened and expelled
by early contractions, though a lot of
folks lose it days or weeks before
beginning labor. Then there's this fluid
fil bag that the fetus has been hanging
out in called the amniotic sack. This
usually bursts during the first stage of
labor. That's what it means for
someone's water to break and it can
happen in a gush or a less dramatic
trickle. Once the cervix is around 5 to
6 cm dilated and contractions are less
than 5 minutes apart, active labor has
begun. This is typically more intense
and it's what takes the cervix all the
way to 10 cm, big enough for the baby's
grand entrance. When it comes to
delivery, there are a few different
methods. We'll start with the most
common, vaginal delivery. About seven
out of 10 births in the US happen this
way. Once the cervix is fully dilated,
the second stage of labor kicks off
called the pushing stage. If you're
delivering, you may feel an urge to
push, or your body may push for you.
Thanks to something called the fetus
ejection reflex. Now, despite a 10 cm
hole opening up in the cervix, the
vagina still needs to stretch for the
fetus to pass through. Nine and 10 first
timers report experiencing some kind of
vaginal tearing during birth or
something called an aesiottomy where a
member of the birth team makes a small
cut in the vaginal opening. Thankfully,
after the shoulders are out, the rest of
the body follows pretty fast and voila,
a baby. But hang on, because the third
stage of birth is the delivery of the
placenta. Most people find this part a
lot easier than delivering a baby. Now,
as for the three out of 10 births that
aren't vaginal deliveries, first there's
an assisted vaginal delivery where the
doctor uses forceps or suction to help
pull the baby out. And sometimes a
C-section or cesarian birth might be
necessary. This is when the doctor makes
an incision in the abdomen and uterus
and removes the baby that way. There are
so many ways that birth happens, but
once all is said and done, well, the
journey is just beginning. While birth
may be over, the fourth trimester has
just begun. Also known as the newborn
phase, the fourth trimester is those
first three months after birth. It is a
key stage of development for both baby
and parent. And for the person who just
gave birth, their body won't be back to
business as usual for a while. For the
first 6 weeks, the person who gave birth
can expect bleeding and cramping as the
uterus contracts to its normal size.
Cramping also happens because oxytocin,
the hormone released during
breastfeeding, is the same one that
triggers contractions. And while the
uterus may remain a little bigger after
giving birth, it's a myth that the
vagina gets permanently stretched out.
For most people, it goes back to its
pre-birth shape and size in about 3 to 6
months. Though, doctors do recommend
that people who just gave birth pay
special attention to any weakening in
their pelvic floor, the group of muscles
in the pelvis that sort of holds
everything together. So, there you go.
Pregnancy and childirth in a nutshell,
or should I say a uterus. Having a baby
is a long complex process where the body
undergoes huge changes. It's also
something humans have been doing for as
long as there have been humans and it's
as strange and all inspiring as ever. If

we're waiting into some deep waters and

XHXC0uOLOkA,"Here’s the year the stars fell.
The year of many buffalo.
The year of whooping cough.
The year of measles.
The year of an eclipse.
The year the white soldiers attacked.
A year of peace.
A year of war.
This is a winter count.
It’s a record of 71 years of Yanktonai history.
Each picture represents a notable 
event between first snowfalls.
But this is just a snippet 
of a much larger timeline.
Every tribe has one—a history that’s
deep, ongoing, and totally unique.
And yet…they’re all unified by one thing.
Hi! I'm Che Jim and welcome to
Crash Course Native American History.
[THEME MUSIC]
First things first: there’s no way we can tell
the entire history of Indigenous people
in what’s now the United States.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t bridge some gaps 
and add a little complexity 
to common understandings.
Maybe we’ll even go crazy and 
fix some misunderstandings.
Studies have shown that, across 
the board in U.S. schools,
students aren’t getting much of an education
when it comes to Native American History
– not by a long shot.
As one Navajo/Hopi student wrote in 2019,
“ [...] of the U.S. history 
books used in my classroom, 
there are 307 pages and only 
10 pages talk about Natives.”
So yeah, this will be hard.
And we won’t cover everything.
But we’ll cover a lot of things.
We hope to help answer some big questions,
leave you curious about others,
and really blow your hair 
back with facts about how 
Native history has shaped our world today.
So let’s start with a word on words.
There are over five hundred Native tribes,
also called nations, within the U.S. alone.
Some are recognized by the federal 
government, and some aren’t.
I’m a member of the Navajo Nation—not to brag.
But even that simple statement 
has layers of nuance.
We call ourselves Diné, which 
means “the people.”
Navajo is a name that came 
about thanks to Europeans.
Some Diné folks use the term 
Navajo; others prefer not to. 
It’s a “to each their own” situation.
Throughout this series, I’ll use 
specific Native nations’ names.
So, if I’m talking about the Kickapoo 
or the Hualapai or the Chickahominy, 
you’ll hear me say so — with 
perfect pronunciation, to boot.
Okay, I’ll try my best.
And I’ll use the word “Native.” Like, a lot.
I might say “Native folks” or “Native people.”
But I’ll also say Indigenous.
That’s the broadest term for 
people worldwide who’ve been 
living in a particular place 
since before settlers arrived.
Like for example, in the 
U.S., the Aleut, the Chumash, 
and the Kanaka Maoli? All Indigenous.
But the Sámi in places like Norway,
the Maya in places like Mexico and Guatemala,
and the Ainu in Japan are also all Indigenous.
In that way, we’re kind of like cousins.
Not by blood — more by vibes.
You’ll also sometimes hear me say American Indian— 
a label that some Indigenous 
people embrace, and others reject.
Pro: it’s been around for a long time.
It’s used in U.S. laws, 
treaties, even the names of 
federal agencies like the 
Bureau of Indian Affairs.
“Indian” is also just a term 
older Native people like to use, 
especially around other Native people.
Con? This. Is not. India. Buddy!
Another con: Even though any Native could
self-identify as an ""American Indian,""
it doesn't ""officially"" 
include all Indigenous people.
That’s because the government 
only applies the term 
to members of federally recognized Native nations
in the contiguous 48 states, but not
Alaska Natives or Native Hawaiians.
We’ll talk a lot more about what it 
means to have federal recognition, 
as well as the status of Natives in 
Alaska and Hawaii, later in the series.
For now, let’s end this vocabulary 
lesson with Native American.
This term came about in the 1960s,
as an alternative to “American Indian.”
It’s gained a lot of ground as a go-to option.
But “Native American” has its own issues!
Like, the Americas are all of this business.
Maybe even this?
Possibly this too, but now we’re getting wild!
Of course, this term isn’t preferred everywhere.
In Canada, many Indigenous people prefer
to be called First Nations or First Peoples,
one of three categories alongside Inuit and Métis.
In Spanish-speaking Latin 
America, many prefer “indígenas.”
So “Native American” isn’t perfect.
But it broadly describes 
Indigenous people within the U.S.
At the end of the day, how Natives 
choose to identify is very personal!
I call myself Indigenous.
I also call myself handsome and brave, 
every morning in front of the mirror.
Every Indigenous person has their own
preferences when it comes to identity.
Though for the record, you’re 
all brave and handsome.
[mumbles] Just not as much as me.
The point is, there are no definitive rules on
Indigenous terminology — there couldn’t be!
Like, remember how I said there are hundreds
of Native nations inside the U.S. alone?
Well, even that’s complicated!
About forty Native nations today have
territories split in half by the U.S. border.
Like the Kanyen'kehà:ka, or Mohawk 
Nation of Awkwesasne to the north.
Or the Tohono O’odham Nation to the south.
And many, many, many Native 
nations—like the Ho-Chunk—
were forced away from their ancestral homelands,
and live in a totally different region today.
But, with just 24 episodes, we needed to
narrow down so we had room to go deep.
So, that’s why we’ll be focusing mainly on 
the history of Native 
peoples in the United States.
And that’s why we’re calling the 
series Native American History.
I fought for the name “A Brave and Handsome
History of Native America” but I was not successful.
Which brings me to the paradox at the 
heart of Native American history.
On the one hand, there are tons of Native
nations with their own unique histories!
Their own timelines!
There is no single history that we 
can call Native American History.
On the other hand, Native nations 
share some common experiences, 
though they’ve happened in 
different ways, times, and places.
Those common experiences are a 
result of settler-colonialism, 
a force that binds Native histories together.
Remember back in the intro when I said that
there’s one thing that unites our histories?
This is that thing!
Let me break it down.
We’ll start with colonialism 
— that’s where one nation 
exerts control over another 
nation and its resources
without becoming part of that nation themselves.
For example, colonialism describes what happened 
when the British took over 
Nigeria in the 19th century,
ruling indirectly through local 
leaders and getting rich off palm oil.
Nigerians still lived there, but 
their lives were never the same.
The “settler” part takes this a step beyond.
The goal of settler-colonialism is to remove
and erase the people already living in a place,
so that a new group can move in instead.
And this isn’t just describing a 
single historical event or person.
But yes, I’m talking about you.
Settler-colonialism describes a system.
And the history of the whole United 
States was shaped by this system.
It’s the underlying logic behind 
centuries of wars, treaties, 
policies, and laws that affect 
Native peoples’ lives to this day.
That system is part of the reason why basically
any question that seems simple 
is going to be complicated!
Like, take this one: “How many 
Native Americans are there?”
Well, before settlers arrived in North America, 
nobody here called themselves 
“Indian” or a “Native American.”
Those categories didn’t exist!
We were kind of just living our lives.
But in the 19th century, the federal government
created a new, single Native identity,
lumping all Native people 
together as a single “race”.
Suddenly, in the words of High School Musical’s
Troy Bolton, we were “all in this together.”
The government created records of tribal members
and assigned each person a blood quantum,
or perceived fraction of “Indian blood.”
Freaky-sounding term, right?
The idea was that, over time, 
children born to Native families 
would have lower and lower blood quantums.
Thinking of “Indian blood” as something that
could be diluted down to zero over generations
served the goal of eliminating Native people.
First so their land could be taken, and second, 
to eventually relieve the federal government
of its treaty and trust obligations to Natives.
But — hi! Hello! — we’re still here! Plan failed!
As of the 2020 U.S. Census,  
about 9.7 million people
— or 2.9 percent of the population —
self-identified as American 
Indian or Alaska Native.
Though this, too, is…wait for it…complicated.
It’s not clear how many of those 
people were enrolled tribal members, 
members of tribes the federal 
government doesn’t recognize,
or even just people who’ve 
heard family stories about 
their great-great grandma 
being a Cherokee princess.
Settlers have such big imaginations.
Anyway, we’ll talk much more about 
Native identity in Episode 4.
For now, let’s talk about what we mean by
the “history” part of Native American History.
The past five centuries have had an 
enormous impact on Native nations.
But also: the past five centuries are just a blip!
About twenty generations!
We often use the phrase “since time immemorial”
— or the beginning of time itself —
to describe Natives’ deep and 
ongoing presence on this continent.
We’re the descendants of the first inhabitants.
We’ve been here continuously 
for thousands of years.
Don’t make me math the math on 
how many generations that is.
But when Native American history does get told, 
it’s usually in a way that begins 
in 1492 and ends in the late 1800s.
Which might give you the impression that history
didn’t really begin until Europeans showed up.
Or that what happened before is unknowable.
Or that Native Americans are mere extras
in an A-list drama of the United States,
and we mysteriously vanished by the 20th century,
only a brief blurb on the nation’s IMDB page.
But nah, none of those things are true.
Again: hi! Hello! Still here! We made it!
The past before European 
contact is not unknowable.
Native peoples’ oral traditions 
hold knowledge of the past.
Like, for generations, the Klamath 
people have passed down a story 
about a long-ago volcano that 
erupted and filled with water,
becoming what’s now Crater Lake.
And this memory of an ancient eruption?
It happened! 7,600 years ago. That was about 1500 years 
before anyone even started building Stonehenge.
Our ancestors were very skilled at gossip.
Even gossip about volcanoes.
Which is why we’ll include 
stuff that happened before 1492.
We’ll talk about the creation stories, worldviews,
and connections to place, food, and ancestors
that are thousands of years old 
and that still endure today, 
despite settlers’ best efforts to wipe them out.
And we’ll also talk about how the 
settlers’ impact has persisted 
beyond the 1800s and continues to play out today.
Often, you’ll catch me talking about last year
and hundreds of years ago in the same breath.
Because the past and the present are connected.
Way closer than you might think.
All wound together, like 
braids, or DNA, or Twizzlers.
‘Cause when Native American 
history doesn’t get told,
the general public underestimates the ongoing
impacts of colonization and discrimination.
Native people get written out of 
the past and the present, too.
But it’s time for that to end.
Because without Native American history,
there would be no U.S. history.
The U.S. isn’t even the 
oldest democracy around here! 
I see you, Haudenosaunee Confederacy.
Native American history is 
more than a single story.
It’s hundreds of timelines 
across hundreds of nations.
Each with their own unique experiences, histories, 
languages, traditions, and 
relationships with each other.
We’re still here, connected in ways
that transcend the attempts to erase us.
And we’re shaping what happens next —
whether this guy’s ghost likes it or not.
[Ghost of Colonial Carl] I do not actually.
[Che] I don’t care.
In our next episode, we’ll 
talk about something else 
every Native nation has in common: sovereignty.
I’ll see you then.

elDPvihPN4k,"Game show host Shan: Welcome 
to The Contraception Game,  
where we introduce you to eligible birth control.
First up—they love to DIY, here’s natural methods!
They know how to set 
boundaries—it’s barrier methods!
These guys have progestin to give, 
say hello to hormonal methods!
They’re ready to be your emergency 
contact… Let’s call up emergency methods!
They are ready to commit, give 
a warm welcome to permanent methods!
Teen Shan: 
What’s supposed to be over there?
Game show host Shan: Oh, that's the male birth 
control pill. It hasn’t shown up yet.
[Fake audience gasps]
Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex Ed,  
and today we’re talking about 
how to not get pregnant. Yeah.
[applause]
We’ll be right back after these messages.
[THEME MUSIC]
A quick note on language: We’ll mostly refer 
to cisgender men and women in this episode,  
because that’s where most of 
the research has been done.
But trans men and nonbinary people can and 
do get pregnant, and male birth control is  
just as important for trans women, 
as IUDs and pills are for trans men.
Regardless of the genders involved, 
it takes two to make a pregnancy.
One limited edition egg, and 
one tiny, tail-wagging sperm.
Contraception is all about finding 
ways to make sure these two never meet.
Or those two. Or… those two. Yeah, 
there’s a lot of sperm up in here.
The typical ejaculation releases nearly 
two to three hundred million of them.
And keeping all those swimmers 
away from an egg is no easy task.
So, how do you do it?
Teen Shan: Nadine’s cousin’s neighbor told
me to just make sure the guy 
pulls out before he… y’know.
Oh yeah, I do remember hearing that, Teen Shan.
Well, more clinically, that’s called withdrawal.
During P-in-V sex, someone removes 
their penis before ejaculation,  
so the semen goes somewhere 
outside their partner’s vagina.
But there’s a reason it’s often 
called “pull out and pray.”
For one, a guy has to pull out in time.
And also, it’s still possible for 
sperm to be in the pre-ejaculate,  
the stuff that comes out before semen, 
especially if he didn't pee before sex.
So all said, pulling out can have 
a one in five chance of failure.
Big picture, withdrawal is what 
we’d call a “natural” method.
The other big one is fertility awareness.
Sometimes called the rhythm method, it involves 
a woman tracking and recording her temperature,  
cervical mucus, or menstrual cycle 
to predict which days she’s fertile  
and should avoid sex, or at least use a condom.
We’ll talk more about the 
fertile window in Episode 9.
According to sources like the UK’s National Health 
Service, fertility awareness can be effective.
But if it’s not done perfectly, there’s 
about a one in four chance of failure.
This method is difficult to get right,  
and it’s much tougher if someone’s 
period isn’t regular or easily tracked.
For something more reliable, 
there’s barrier methods.
They’re anything that blocks sperm from the goal,  
like the ever-popular, 
always-put-on-a-banana condom.
Seriously, condom demonstrations 
ruined bananas for me.
Anyway, barrier methods come in two types:  
the external kind that rolls on to a 
penis and traps sperm-filled semen.
And the internal kind, which does exactly 
the same thing, but sits inside a vagina.
Condoms are pretty cheap, at most 
pharmacies, and when used correctly,  
highly effective at preventing pregnancy 
and sexually transmitted infections.
If you always use one perfectly, the 
World Health Organization estimates  
that external condoms are about ninety-eight 
percent effective at preventing pregnancies,  
while that number for internal 
condoms is about ninety-five percent.
Teen Shan: What about the pill? I 
heard Nadine’s older sister is on it.
Yep, birth control pills are another 
popular type of contraception.
The pill’s an example of a hormonal 
method, which also includes patches,  
shots, implants, and many intrauterine devices, or IUDs.
Hormonal methods block ovulation, that time 
once a month when an ovary releases an egg.
Two hormones—progestin and sometimes 
estrogen—can stop ovulation from happening.
And they can also make the mucus 
around the cervix super-sticky,  
so sperm have a harder time wiggling through.
These methods are impermanent but highly effective  
for a specific amount of time — from 
twenty-four hours to almost a decade.
But not every method works right away.
It can take as long as a week for it to 
become fully effective, depending on the type.
Unlike barrier methods, hormonal 
methods do have side effects,  
which can vary from person to person, and 
include things like nausea or headaches.
Most go away after about three months, but this 
also varies between people and between methods.
Also, almost all hormonal 
options require a doctor’s visit.
The exception is the mini-pill, which contains 
only progestin and can be bought over the counter.
The mini-pill does have some slightly different 
risks than the combined pill, though, so like with  
any of these methods, we highly recommend learning 
more before deciding what’s right for you.
Now, I can not emphasize enough how huge 
a deal it was when the birth control pill  
became widely available in 
the mid-twentieth century.
Creating it was a decades-long 
journey.
But unfortunately, some really harmful ideas guided its development.
In the 1920s and ‘30s, the movement to develop 
birth control in the U.S. became all tangled up  
with eugenics, the false belief that humans 
could be improved by keeping certain groups  
of people — including immigrants, disabled 
folks, and people of color — from having kids.
This is civil rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer.
In 1961, she had surgery to remove a uterine 
tumor, but woke to find that her doctor had  
performed a hysterectomy—her entire uterus 
had been removed without her consent.
This meant she could never get pregnant.
Hamer was just one of more than seventy thousand 
people in the U.S.—mostly Black, Latina,  
and Native women—who were sterilized against 
their will under eugenics-inspired policies.
In fact, this practice became 
so common among Black women in  
the South that Hamer dubbed it 
a “Mississippi appendectomy.”
This was the kind of environment the 
birth control pill was developed in.
Before the FDA approved the first pill, 
called Enovid, a version that contained  
more hormones and could have much stronger side 
effects was tested on women in Puerto Rico,  
who weren’t warned of the risks or even told 
they were taking part in a clinical trial.
Three women died in the process.
The prescription pill eventually hit 
the market in 1957, which allowed  
many women unprecedented control over 
their reproductive decision-making.
But as revolutionary as that was, it came from a  
legacy of women whose reproductive 
control was taken away from them.
Over the decades, new brands of the 
pill and new varieties of long-acting,  
reversible contraceptives—or 
LARCs—have been developed.
These are “set it and forget 
it” options that someone can  
stop using whenever they want to get pregnant.
And in 2024, the first over-the-counter birth 
control pill in the U.S. became available.
But when it comes to hormonal methods 
like the pill, women often carry most  
of the responsibility for not getting pregnant.
So, why isn’t there a male birth control pill?
One reason it doesn’t exist yet is because the  
bar to prove a contraceptive is safe 
is higher today than it was in 1960.
Good—it should be!
But then there’s a less-good reason: there’s not 
the same sense of urgency to develop a male pill.
Women have traditionally been responsible for 
reproduction, and they already have options.
Some researchers also say it’s been harder 
to lock down the hormone levels that can  
disarm millions of sperm without 
risking a lot of side effects.
Like, in a 2011 trial, shots 
of two hormones—progestin and  
testosterone—were found to be really 
good at stopping sperm production.
But the trial was cut off because of side effects 
like severe acne, mood swings, and weight gain.
Teen Shan: Wait, aren’t those like the same 
side effects that women can have from the pill?
They are. But for women, ethics 
committees are comparing the  
side effects from the pill against the 
health risks of carrying a pregnancy.
So, these side effects are deemed acceptable.
For cis men, they’re comparing the side 
effects of those shots against… well, nothing.
So, the shots don’t get the green light.
Still, there’s been some recent 
progress toward a male pill.
In 2023, researchers discovered a chemical 
compound that stops sperms’ tails from wagging,  
so they can’t swim far enough to fertilize an egg.
But don’t break out the condom balloons yet! 
This compound has only been studied in mice.
And there’s a long road ahead before 
it’s part of a male contraceptive.
As of 2024, there is a male birth control pill 
that's in early phases of clinical trials,  
and there’s also a male birth control gel 
that's a bit further along in its testing
The gel uses both progestin 
and testosterone so that men  
using it don’t produce enough 
sperm to get someone pregnant.
And to apply it, they just 
rub it on their shoulders.
Okay! That sounds promising. Alright, 
fine, we can blow up one condom balloon.
So, today, we have natural methods, 
barrier methods, and hormonal methods.
But what happens if one of those methods fail? 
For that, there’s emergency contraception.
One type is the morning after pill, which can 
be accessed from a doctor, clinic, or pharmacy.
It’s most effective within 
72 hours of unprotected sex,  
and it has to be taken within five 
days to have any chance of working.
Some types of emergency contraception are 
available over the counter in the U.S.,  
so you don’t need a prescription.
And that one pill works for one 
instance of unprotected sex.
It’s a misconception that using the 
morning after pill multiple times will  
cause fertility issues or other health problems.
But it also isn’t meant to be your primary mode of  
contraception because it’s not 
as effective as other methods.
Certain kinds of IUDs can also be 
used as emergency contraception.
They can block sperm from meeting up with 
an egg if they’re inserted within five days  
of unprotected sex, and they continue 
to offer protection for years to come!
But you need to see a doctor for insertion,  
and it’s not always easy to get 
an appointment on short notice.
Now if you really don’t want to have kids? Like, 
ever? For that, there’s permanent birth control.
For anyone with a uterus, this surgical 
procedure is often called “getting your  
tubes tied,” but really it involves either closing  
or removing pieces of the fallopian 
tubes, or taking them out altogether.
A hysterectomy also falls in this category.
For penises, you’ve got the vasectomy.
It involves surgically cutting 
or blocking the vasa deferentia:  
the little tubes that carry 
sperm out of the testicles.
So you still ejaculate, but the semen is 
spermless and can’t get anybody pregnant.
Both types of permanent birth control are highly 
effective, but there is a risk of complications.
Also, many people — especially women — 
have found that doctors can be reluctant  
to perform the procedures, citing things 
like risks and the possibility of regret.
When it comes to contraception, there’s 
a lot going on here! We may not have male  
birth control pills yet, but there 
are still some options for everyone.
And if you’re curious about any of the 
methods we talked about, the best things  
you can do are talk to a doctor and research 
contraceptive methods at the links below.
Get curious, and you’ll find the answers—and 
the options—that work best for you.
Next time, we’re talking 
pregnancy and birth. See you then.
But first, here’s what  
you’ve all been waiting for: how to use a condom.
Before opening the package, make sure it’s intact  
by feeling for the air bubble, 
and check that expiration date.
Now, carefully open the condom 
package, just like this.
Take the condom out.
You’re going to hold it like this, so it looks 
like a cute little hat, and place it on the head  
of the erect penis, pulling back any foreskin, 
if there is any, or you can place it on a toy.
If you accidentally put it on inside-out, 
you gotta get a whole new condom—otherwise,  
there could be pre-ejaculate on it, which 
can contain sperm, bacteria, or viruses.
Then, with one hand, pinch the air out of the 
top, keeping that little tip above the head.
That’s where the semen’s gonna go.
With the other hand, unroll the 
whole condom onto the penis,  
checking that it’s snug, but not too tight.
And make sure you’ve got the condom on from 
the start of sex all the way to the end.
After sex is over, while the penis is still hard, 
hold onto the rim of the condom, then pull out.
Then carefully take it off and throw it away. 
Look at you! You just practiced safer sex.

FgyEIjQ0cr4,"Native American history is right in front of you—
in names like Chattanooga, Oshkosh, and Missoula.
In words like skunk, squash, and bayou.
And if any of that surprises you,
well, you’re not alone.
Hi! I’m Che Jim, I’m an actor, comedian, educator, 
activist, and enrolled 
member of the Navajo Nation.
Growing up, I really took to the 
phrase “laughter is medicine.”
It’s been a common saying among
Native American people for generations.
Laughter creates space, healing,
and an opportunity to grow and listen.
And, at its core, it’s a form of resiliency
and a part of the Native American story —
something I’m excited to share with all of you.
Between misinformation, stereotypes,
and glaring gaps in history classes,
it’s common for the average 
American to have little more 
than a blurry snapshot of Native American history:
one that begins in 1492, 
and ends in the late 1800s.
It’s giving, “Those noble people 
who aren’t around anymore.”
But Native Americans aren’t history.
They’re here and now.
And anybody who calls these 
lands “home” should have 
an understanding of the people who were here first
—and still are.
In 24 episodes, Crash Course Native American History 
will explore as many philosophies, 
stories, and traditions as we can
from the hundreds of distinct 
Native nations in the U.S.
And I've got some stories for you—
like, have you heard the one 
about Jessie Little Doe Baird, 
who brought the language of the 
Wampanoag people back to life?
Or Suzan Shown Harjo, who 
led the decades-long fight 
to change the name of Washington, D.C.’s NFL team?
I could go on.
We’ll also cover some Native Identity 101:
like, what does it mean to be a 
citizen of a Native nation today?
And, yes, we’ll talk about 
what happened after 1492,
tracing how we got from treaties to 
reservations to modern tribal governments.
And we couldn’t have done this alone!
We worked with a team of Native experts:
scholars in federal Indian 
policy, curriculum developers, 
artists, and of course me, your host.
So, let’s meet back here next week.
And we’ll start with a question 
that’s not as simple as it seems:
What actually is Native American History?
And I will see you then.

b2Fon62HgOk,"Here’s the deal: It’s normal to be freaked 
out by sexually transmitted infections. No  
disease is ever fun, and they can be even 
less fun when they have to do with sex.
But actually? STIs are avoidable, 
treatable, and preventable.
So let’s cover the facts. Because just a few  
key pieces of information can 
help you have a safer sex life.
Hi! I'm Shan Boodram and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
Where there are humans, there are germs. 
We sneeze, we get our hands dirty,
and sometimes, we get sexually 
transmitted infections, or STIs,  
which are infections that can be 
spread through sexual contact.
In fact, in 2018 the CDC estimated 
that over sixty-seven million people  
in the U.S. had an STI, with about 
twenty million new cases every year.
And almost half of those new cases showed up  
in people between the ages 
of fifteen and twenty-four.
When it comes to STIs, there are a lot 
of myths out there. Here’s a big one:  
“STIs are so common because 
they’re hard to prevent and treat.”
Actually, most are pretty easy to avoid, but 
many people just don’t know how to prevent them.
And most are also easy to treat. For the few 
that aren’t curable, there are options to  
minimize their impact on your life and make sure 
you don’t pass them on. So, let’s get into it.
Most STIs can be put into one of 
two categories: bacterial or viral.
The most common bacterial STIs are 
gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia.
They’re spread through bodily fluids or  
direct contact with a rash or 
sore during unprotected sex.
And by “fluids,” I don’t just mean semen:
Depending on the STI, “fluids” can also mean 
vaginal fluids, preejaculate, or saliva, and these can be exchanged  
through penetration, oral sex, anal sex, sex toys, 
or even just rubbing genitals against each other.
Luckily, we’ve got a highly effective solution:  
wrap it up. No, not that kind of 
wrap. This kind of wrap. Thank you.
One of the easiest ways to avoid catching an 
STI is to use a barrier method of protection,  
which prevents direct contact.
Like external condoms for penises, internal 
condoms that go inside a vagina or anus,  
and dental dams, which can be placed over a 
vulva or an anus before engaging in oral sex.
And because sex toys can also 
spread bacteria and STIs,  
it’s important to clean those after every use, 
usually with hot water and antibacterial soap.
Condoms can also help make them safer, 
especially with new or multiple partners.
But while barrier methods are really 
good at preventing STIs, they’re not  
perfect—they can malfunction, 
and there can be user error.
That’s why STI testing and 
open dialogue among partners  
is so important. You can even make it flirty!
“Show me your results and I’ll show you mine.”
Now, if you do get a bacterial STI, there is 
a really effective cure for them: antibiotics.
There are even preventative antibiotics, like 
the one called Doxycycline that someone can take  
up to seventy-two hours after a barrier 
method fails, or if they don’t use one.
But they’re not meant to replace 
barrier methods. And at the time of  
recording this video, Doxycycline is only 
recommended for cis-men and transwomen.
As for when to seek treatment? Sometimes, it’s 
clear that something is up down there — pain,  
unusual discharge, sores, or even flu-like 
symptoms with syphilis in particular.
But there’s also this other myth floating around:  
that if you don’t have any symptoms, you 
don’t need to worry about having an STI.
Here’s the truth, though: 
most STIs are asymptomatic,  
meaning someone might not notice 
having any symptoms at all.
Teen Shan: So I could get 
an STI and not even know it?
Mhmm. That’s why it’s so important to get 
tested regularly, especially if you’re having  
sex with multiple partners, or the person you’re 
having sex with is having sex with other people.
Because even when someone isn’t showing symptoms,  
they’re still able to pass on 
the infection to someone else.
And a long-term infection, 
even an asymptomatic one,  
can lead to irreversible damage 
to the reproductive organs.
And hot tip: don’t just assume your doctor is  
testing you for STIs if they 
take your blood or urine sample.
If you want an STI test, you gotta ask for it.
And if you don’t feel like you can ask your 
regular doctor, you can check out your local  
Department of Health, Planned Parenthood, 
or another STI testing option near you.
Now, bacterial STIs aren’t the only ones out 
there. There are also STIs caused by viruses.
And unlike their bacterial 
cousins, viral STIs can’t be  
cured—but medications can keep symptoms in check.
The most common viral STIs are 
herpes; Human Papillomavirus,  
aka HPV; hepatitis B; and Human 
Immunodeficiency Virus, or HIV.
All of these can be transmitted through sexual 
contact with an infected person, so barrier  
methods are a key part of preventing them. 
But what does it look like if you do get one?
Let’s start with herpes. There are two kinds.
HSV-1 usually causes cold sores on the mouth,  
while HSV-2 usually causes 
sores around the genitals.
Either way, the virus is most often 
transmitted by contact with sores,  
but it can also happen even when none are visible.
Once someone gets it, the 
herpes virus is there for keeps.
It can go dormant for long periods 
of time and then pop back up in times  
of stress or when their immune 
system is otherwise compromised.
So, folks with herpes won’t always have 
sores but may experience “recurrences.”
But even though herpes isn’t curable, it 
is very treatable. There are prescription  
medications that can help manage flare-ups 
and put the infection back into dormancy.
Up next, there’s HPV. Unlike 
the two kinds of herpes,  
there are over two hundred different kinds of HPV.
Which sounds scary, but for 
the vast majority of people,  
their immune system will clear out 
an HPV infection pretty quickly.
There are a few strains that can stick around 
and cause genital warts, and other strains can  
cause cells at the site of infection to 
behave in a way that can lead to cancer.
High-risk HPV strains most commonly cause 
cervical cancer, but can also cause other cancers.
The good news is, there’s an HPV vaccine.
And it’s so effective that in 
places where it’s been rolled out,  
researchers have seen drastic decreases in 
cervical cancer in the decades that followed.
Your doctor can give you more information 
on the vaccine if you’re interested,  
or check your records to 
see if you already got it.
And there’s also a vaccine for Hepatitis B,  
which is transmitted through fluids 
from unprotected sex or sharing needles.
And speaking of life-saving science, here’s 
a viral STI you might have heard about before: HIV.
This was once a deadly disease, 
but now it’s considered a chronic,  
manageable illness for those who are able 
to access care—and it can be prevented, too.
HIV damages a person’s immune system, 
making it hard to fight everyday infections,  
and it can sometimes lead to an 
ongoing condition called AIDS.
Although not everyone living 
with HIV develops AIDS.
In the U.S., gay and bisexual men 
are the group most affected by HIV,  
but it can affect people 
of any sexual orientation,  
and be transmitted through many kinds of sex — or 
no sex at all, like through an infected needle.
That said, anal sex is significantly riskier 
for the transmission of HIV than vaginal sex.
That’s because anal and rectal tissue is thin,  
allowing the virus increased 
access to the bloodstream.
While I can’t stress enough how important condoms 
are, there’s an added option for HIV prevention:
For people who are at higher risk of being 
exposed, their doctor can prescribe a medication  
called pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, which 
is taken as a daily pill or a bimonthly injection.
When it’s taken properly, PrEP reduces the risk  
of getting sexually transmitted 
HIV up to ninety-nine percent.
There are also medications that can be taken 
if someone thinks they were exposed to HIV.
If taken within seventy-two hours of 
contact, it can prevent infection.
These are called post-exposure 
prophylaxis drugs, or PEP.
Some people think that PrEP 
and PEP are only for gay men,  
but that’s not true! STIs do not 
discriminate based on sexual orientation.
And if someone is HIV positive? There 
are medications like antiretroviral  
therapy that can help them live a normal, healthy,  
and long life, and prevent them from 
passing the disease on to others.
And scientists around the world are working 
hard to develop an effective HIV vaccine.
Unfortunately, though, there’s still 
serious stigma around HIV in most cultures.
That means medicines like PrEP and PEP — as well  
as programs to help people afford 
them — may not be talked about.
So, some people are speaking up to 
change that. Teen Shan, let ’em know.
This is the famed, the fabulous, 
the ever-fashionable Billy Porter.
He was diagnosed HIV-positive in 2007, and 
kept it private for more than a decade.
In the religious family he grew up in, 
HIV was considered a punishment from God.
And as an actor, there was a chance his 
disease would prevent him from getting work.
But in 2021, he took his diagnosis public. 
“There’s no more stigma,” he said in an interview.
“Let’s be done with that.”
And Porter’s joined by others 
with HIV in stopping the stigma,  
from NBA star Magic Johnson, to 
“Queer Eye” host Jonathan van Ness.
As Van Ness put it on social media, “We have 
come a long way in the fight against HIV/AIDS,  
but there is so much work left to be done.”
So, getting an STI doesn’t have to be a
world-shattering thing — or 
something to be ashamed of.
Overall, understanding how to prevent 
STIs, being aware of your own body,  
and communicating with your 
partners and your doctor are key.
We’re all just trying to help each other 
live our safest, healthiest sex lives.
Ooh! Speaking of prevention — next time, we’re 
talking about contraception. See you then.

Hi, I’m Shan Boodram, this is Crash Course Sex 
Ed, and today we’re talking about virginity:  
is it really a thing? We’ll be 
back right after these messages.
[THEME MUSIC]
When someone thinks “virgin,” their 
mind often goes to the only sex act  
that can make a baby: penis-in-vagina.
Which is complicated, since that’s 
not what all sex looks like,  
but it’s where we’ll camp out for today.
Nobody knows exactly when we 
started caring about virginity,  
but a leading theory is that it goes all 
the way back to the invention of farming.
Which sounds like I made it up, but 
I swear I’m not messing with you.
Farming coincided with the invention of 
property. So suddenly, ownership mattered:  
my land, my crops, my stuff—and, hold 
on, which one of these kids is mine?
In these patriarchal societies, “Who’s 
your daddy?” was an important question.
And the only way for men to be sure about 
their biological dadhood was to invent  
a system where women were expected 
to reserve sex for their husbands.
Old MacDonald had a farm... and 
control over his wife's sex life.
Over the centuries, virginity 
became a whole thing in the West,  
embedded in everything from artwork 
and religion to laws and teen movies.
And premarital virginity became such a 
prized quality in women, people were like,  
“No no no no, we can’t just take her word for it. 
We need to prove that she’s telling the truth.”
In 17th-century England, people theorized  
you could tell a virgin from 
the proportions of her neck.
Before that, in Renaissance Europe, it was thought  
that a virgin could be sussed out 
based on the clarity of her pee.
And of course, virginity detectives 
have long honed in on the hymen.
Don’t know her?
She’s a thin membrane near 
the opening of the vagina.
Literally just some tissue left over after the 
vagina forms during fetal development.
You may have heard that the hymen 
breaks—like the seal on a jar—the  
first time a person with a vagina has P-in-V sex.
Changing them physically forever.
But it doesn’t work like that. And it’s nothing 
like popping a cherry, so let’s just ban that  
phrase forever. Some people with vaginas 
don’t have much of a hymen to begin with.
And for those who do, that tissue often thins 
away way before they’re sexually active,  
from exercising, riding a bike, 
using a tampon, or just existing.
Many people never know their hymen’s 
there, much less when it’s gone.
Still, this myth is so globally pervasive that 
some parents still ask doctors to “test” their  
child’s virginity by checking the hymen and the 
stretchiness of the vagina… but according to  
medical experts, neither of those things tell you 
anything about whether that person has had sex.
The vagina doesn’t permanently stretch out the 
first, or any of the times that someone has sex.
The va-jay-jay is like a rubber 
band; it just bounces back.
Trust me on that one, I birthed two babies.
It’s also a myth that a person with a vagina 
always bleeds or experiences pain the first  
time they have sex. It can happen, but not always. 
And it might have nothing to do with the hymen.
Discomfort can happen for lots of reasons, 
including tension, position, speed,  
or not being lubricated enough—even 
if it’s your three-thousandth time.
Sex doesn’t have to be painful, and if it 
is, your doctor can help you out with that.
All of this is to say: virginity is not a medical 
reality. There’s no physical way of telling  
whether a person has had penis-in-vagina sex—not 
from the hymen any more than from the earlobe.
So if virginity isn’t a physical 
state of being, what is it?
Think of virginity like money. It’s real in 
the sense that some people care a lot about it,  
and it impacts our lives — I mean, having 
sex for the first time is a real experience.
And it can be a big moment in someone’s 
life! But the value we assign to virginity?  
That’s something that cultures have just made up.
More specifically, virginity is an 
example of a sexual script—one of  
the many social expectations about 
how to behave when it comes to sex.
This idea was first proposed in the 1960s by 
sociologists John Gagnon and William Simon,  
who argued that human sexuality is less driven  
by biological instincts than 
the social meanings we create.
You can think of scripts like stage 
directions in a given time and place.
Like, if you send me the eggplant 
emoji, I’m gonna think you’re flirting.
Sexual scripts train people in what’s “normal” or 
“correct” sexual behavior, and they often interact  
with scripts for gender—society’s 
type-cast roles for men and women.
On top of that, traditional sexual scripts 
in the West are highly heteronormative,  
presuming that only men and 
women have sex with each other.
Oh, and those women sharing a life 
together? Yeah, they’re just roommates.
Like, here’s a sexual script you might have heard 
before: Men mainly care about the physical parts  
of sex, and the emotional relationship with 
their partner… well that’s less important.
Meanwhile, for women, it’s all about the emotions.
But those traditional scripts aren’t for 
everybody, and if they don’t work for you,  
you can write your own story. Especially when 
the scripts handed to you do more harm than good.
For example, multiple studies have 
found that women living in cultures  
that prize virginity are often more reluctant to  
have conversations about sexual health 
or access certain types of healthcare.
Take Pap smears. They involve swabbing 
the cervix to check for cancerous cells,  
and are recommended for everyone 
with a vagina who’s over twenty-one.
But in cultures that value purity, 
some women avoid getting the procedure,  
thinking it’ll threaten their status as a 
virgin or reveal that they have had P-in-V sex.
And like we talked about in Episode 4,  
gendered sexual scripts often cast people 
in rigid roles they didn’t choose.
Like, that script about men not prioritizing emotional 
intimacy? That starts developing early,
as boys get cast in gender 
roles that go something like:  
“Explore! Be assertive! But 
don’t talk about feelings!”
Compare that with the script 
traditionally handed to girls:  
“Settle down! Be careful! 
Think of others’ feelings!”
Growing up with these scripts 
can shape our expectations,  
creating miscommunications that make it seem 
like men and women are innately different.
So different they might as 
well be from different planets,  
a claim made by the 1992 book ""Men 
Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus"".
In it, you’ll find statements like: men like the 
news, the weather, gadgets, gizmos, and uniforms.  
Women care about feelings, beauty, relationships, 
and wearing a different outfit every day.
But these claims aren’t well supported by 
research.
The gender similarities hypothesis,  proposed by psychologist Janet Hyde,  
asserts that men and women are 
more alike than they are different.
In a study on areas where men and 
women are often assumed to part ways,  
like math skills and the gift of gab, Hyde 
found no statistically significant differences.
When it came to sexuality, the 
largest gender differences were  
frequency of masturbation and 
attitudes toward casual sex.
But how much of that ties into sexual scripts?
Some researchers have also pointed 
out that boys are taught to touch  
their genitals from an early age 
so they can aim while peeing,  
which can lead to more exploration, and more 
experience with what feels good to them.
“For kids your age it’s just something normal”
Meanwhile, girls are often taught that their 
vulva is something they shouldn’t touch.
[TV test sound effect]
And can we really talk about attitudes 
toward casual sex without addressing the  
virgin script in the room? That gendered 
double-standard that tells girls it’s  
shameful to have sex while telling 
boys it’s shameful to be a virgin?
Or how about the flip that happens 
as we get older, from “Oh my gosh,  
you’re too young to have sex!” to “What 
do you mean you haven’t done it yet?”
Either way, decades of research show that 
these narrow scripts are not good for us.
The good news is, these scripts don’t have to 
be your story. Your culture hands you a draft,  
not a blueprint of how to live your life.
Even people who like the traditional script may  
find it limiting at some point—like 
when a man needs to cry, or a woman  
wants to enjoy some casual sex without 
getting branded with a scarlet letter!
So, go ahead: Edit them, scribble in the margins, 
write your own plot. For years, I was told that  
my first experience of P-in-V sex was “bad” 
because it didn’t look like most people’s.
And it wasn't until I took a 
big ol' red marker to the virginity  
script that I was able to own and 
appreciate my story.
And the more freedom we grant each other to write our 
own stories, the better off we all are.
So is virginity really a thing?
Well, it isn’t a physical absolute, and 
it doesn’t have any inherent value.
It’s one of the many scripts our culture hands to us.
But those aren’t objective truths, and you 
get to decide which parts you want to keep,  
and which parts you want to write yourself.
Next time, we’re busting myths 
about STIs. See you then.

_wx8XooVlVs,"My first crush was my neighbor, Devin, 
who aside from once participating in a  
“Shan Boooooo” chant, I’m not sure knew 
who I was. But despite that small detail,  
I genuinely believed we were made for each other.
And that crush was followed by a cascade 
of crushes. When I was a preteen,  
I used to serenade the boy band posters on 
my walls. You could say I was boy-obsessed.
But why is that? Why have I always 
been into guys instead of girls?  
And why are some people into both, or 
neither? And why does it even matter?
Hi! I’m Shan Boooooodram, and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
When I talk about the people that we’re into, 
I’m talking about sexual orientation—if men,  
women, neither, or both make you 
all sweaty and weak in the knees.
Sexual orientation might line up with who 
someone’s actually having sex with, or how they  
publicly identify, or it might not, for lots of 
reasons. We talked about that more in Episode 1.
For now, though, here’s the big thing 
to know: Sexual orientation exists  
on a spectrum—not just two opposites, 
but all the possibilities in-between.
So, on one end of the spectrum, if you’re 
straight, that means you’re a woman who’s  
exclusively attracted to men, or a man 
who’s exclusively attracted to women.  
It’s the same as being heterosexual, 
the prefix “hetero” meaning “other.”
Now, on the other end, if you’re lesbian or gay, 
you’re a woman who’s exclusively attracted to  
women, or a man who’s exclusively attracted 
to men. Both can be considered homosexual,  
the prefix “homo” meaning “same”—although 
that term can be seen as dated.
But there are tons of other sexual 
identities in-between those two,  
often lumped together under 
the “LGBTQIA+” umbrella.
Teen Shan: Should I say all the 
letters one by one like that?  
Or should I pronounce it like eljibbitycueaiah?
Shan: Definitely one by one.
We’re gonna get into that acronym a bit 
later, because it hasn’t been around forever.  
But when it comes to all the variation in human 
sexuality? That’s been documented for centuries.
Diversity in sexuality was the norm in 
various cultures across the ancient world,  
from China to Egypt to Rome. Alexander the 
Great famously had both male and female lovers.
But right now, it’s illegal to 
be gay in sixty-four countries,  
and in twelve of those, it’s punishable 
by life in prison or even death.
And even in countries where being 
gay is legal, like the U.S.,  
it’s not universally accepted. So what happened?
Well, different prejudices around same-sex 
intercourse have existed for ages,  
driven by religion and cultural beliefs. 
But the fire really sparked soon after  
Christianity came to ancient Rome, 
thanks to scripture prohibiting it.
And in the 1200s, Christian philosopher 
Thomas Aquinas fanned the flames,  
claiming that same-sex intercourse was against 
the natural order of things God had created.
This idea that homosexual behavior is 
“unnatural” spread even further as a  
result of Christian missionary 
work and European colonization.  
And it’s been doing damage for 
more than eight hundred years.
Like, flash forward to the 1950s, when 
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  
Medical Disorders, the guide psychiatrists 
use to make diagnoses, was first published.
It didn’t call homosexuality a sin, but it 
did carry on the prejudices of the past by  
classifying it as a mental illness. It took 
decades for that classification to be undone,  
thanks to a psychiatrist in 
disguise. Teen Shan, let ’em know.
The year was 1972. Members of the American 
Psychiatric Association had gathered for their  
annual conference in Dallas, Texas. Several 
people sat on a panel about psychiatry and  
homosexuality… including someone wearing a 
costume and a Richard Nixon mask: Dr. Anonymous.
“I am a homosexual,” he said into a microphone 
that distorted his voice. “I am a psychiatrist.” 
Leading up to the conference, lesbian 
activists Kay Tobin Lahusen and Barbara  
Gittings had searched endlessly 
for a gay psychiatrist who’d be  
willing to speak on the panel to help 
destigmatize their own sexuality.
But doing so could jeopardize their 
careers, so many turned them down.
Except for Dr. John Fryer, a gay psychiatrist  
who had lost a residency position 
because of his sexual orientation.
He agreed to be the voice of gay psychiatrists 
on the panel—if he could protect his identity.
During his speech, he spoke directly to 
the closeted psychiatrists in the room,  
saying that though coming 
out would be risky, quote,
“We are taking an even bigger risk … 
not accepting fully our own humanity,  
with all the lessons it has to teach 
all the other humans around us.”
His speech made an impact: the following year,  
homosexuality was removed as 
a mental illness from the DSM.
And twenty years later, Dr. Fryer 
revealed himself as Dr. Anonymous.
So homosexuality is not a mental illness.
But that still doesn’t answer our big 
question: why do we like who we like?
Is it because we’re born this way? Is there a 
code in my DNA that made me so boy-obsessed?
Well, it’s not as simple as that,  
but scientists have found evidence that DNA 
and sexual orientation seem to be related.
They can’t say that DNA causes 
anyone to be gay, straight,  
or anything else — but some studies have 
found evidence that there is a connection.
Like, studies that followed identical 
twins found that if one twin was gay,  
there was a small, increased likelihood 
that the other twin was as well.
And big picture, a 2019 study 
found that hundreds or even  
thousands of genes may contribute 
to a person’s sexual orientation,  
and which of those genes gets turned on or off is 
probably strongly influenced by internal factors,  
like hormones we’re exposed to — not just 
in the womb, but also later during puberty.
So, biology might be part of the story. But it’s  
also more complicated than 
Lady Gaga’s “born this way.”
One thing we know thanks to sexological 
research is that who we’re attracted to  
isn’t always fixed: It can change 
and shift throughout our lives.
This is called sexual fluidity, and it means 
that if you’re attracted to one gender now,  
it doesn’t mean you could never be 
attracted to another gender in the future.
And surveys have found that those shifts 
might happen for various personal,  
social, or environmental reasons 
that aren’t related to genetics.
That said, evidence shows that sexual 
orientation can’t be forcibly changed.
Notably, thousands of young LGBTQ+ people 
have undergone conversion therapy:  
treatments to try and make them heterosexual.
This can involve medication, talk 
therapy, humiliation, and much more.
But conversion therapy has been renounced by a long list 
of medical and psychotherapy associations,  
including the American Psychiatric Association and  
the American Medical Association — 
not only because it’s ineffective,  
but because multiple studies have found that 
it’s associated with mental health risks.
Ultimately, why we like who we like is 
complicated. Throughout the centuries,  
the way some societies have viewed 
sexual orientation has changed.
And so have the ways people have talked about it.
Which brings us back to that big 
ol’ acronym from the beginning.
It started with LG — the lesbian and gay 
community — but has expanded over the years,  
with different identities being acknowledged.
The B stands for bisexual.
Teen Shan: I know what that means. 
It’s being attracted to girls and guys.
Shan: Well, yes and no.
Some people see it that way, but others see 
bisexuality as encompassing more than the  
gender binary, including attraction 
to nonbinary and trans people.
And other folks choose to identify as pan- or 
omnisexual, “pan” and “omni” meaning “all.”
The T and I are for “transgender” and 
“intersex"",
which we 
talked about in episode 4.
The Q has two meanings: “questioning,” 
which helps those who may not be sure  
of their sexualities feel welcome in the group.
And “queer,” which is often used today as 
an umbrella term for the whole community,  
or as a way of not strictly labeling 
someone’s sexual orientation.
Teen Shan: Uh, Shan… even I know 
that word’s not cool to say.
Shan: Well, good point— “queer” has 
been used as a slur in the past,  
though today, many in the community have 
reclaimed it as a term for self-identity.
But that isn’t true everywhere,  
so be careful about using the term, especially 
if you don’t identify that way yourself.
The A stands for asexual. This 
term encompasses the ace spectrum,  
people who experience low or no sexual attraction.
For example, demisexual people 
only experience sexual attraction  
if they’re already very close with a person.
And finally, you’ve got the plus, which 
includes all the many additional sexual  
orientations people experience, and 
the words they use to describe them.
Now, this acronym isn’t perfect. 
Some folks think it’s too clunky,  
or that it normalizes straightness by lumping 
all the “other” people into one big group.
But lots of people find it useful for 
building community, especially when  
they’re fighting oppression and injustice 
against different marginalized identities.
As for how many people are in this big ol’ group? 
As of 2021, based on census data, the Human Rights  
Campaign estimated that there may be as many as 20 
million LGBTQ+ adults in the United States alone.
So yeah, that’s why pride parades are so lit.
In the end, we might not know exactly why we’re 
into the people we’re into — but as a society,  
we’ve definitely decided that it matters.
Once, people wrote the story that being anything
other than straight is wrong, and today, 
many others are working hard to unwrite it.
Because variation in sexual orientation 
and behavior has always been around.  
And our understanding of it will just 
keep on growing and evolving as we do.
Next time, we’re asking another big question: 
is virginity even a thing? We’ll see you then.

evUZ0MGseJY,"Imagine, from an early age, feeling 
that your body isn’t your home.
Who you know yourself to be on the inside doesn’t 
match who people assume you are from the outside.
What steps would you take to fix that? Would 
you change your name? Your clothes? Your body?
And which of those steps would be 
the one that made you feel like… you?
That’s the experience for many 
transgender people—who are assigned  
a gender at birth that’s different 
from the way they know themselves.
So let’s talk about what it 
really means to transition.
Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
No matter what color confetti 
exploded at their gender reveal party,  
someone’s genitals aren’t their 
destiny. They’re also not their  
gender —the socially constructed roles 
and behaviors often expected of us.
And genitals aren’t even 
the end-all, be-all of sex,  
a classification based on physical traits that 
involves genitals, but also hormones and genes.
Sex is often treated like a fork in the road: 
male or female, penis or vagina. But in reality,  
the possibilities look a lot more 
like a New York City subway map.
So, let’s take a look at the map!
The egg and the sperm that made you went 
halfsies on all your chromosomes, the bundles  
of DNA that make you you. And it’s mainly the 23rd 
chromosome pair that affects your sex development.
From the egg, you get an X 
chromosome. And from the sperm,  
you usually get either another X, 
making you XX. Or a Y, making you XY.
At about six weeks, an XX embryo usually 
starts developing what doctors would  
consider female reproductive organs: ovaries, 
fallopian tubes, a uterus, and a vagina.
And an XY embryo usually has a gene that turns on 
like: “grow a pair.” The embryo develops testes,  
those testes start secreting testosterone, 
and voila, more male reproductive organs:  
a prostate and a penis. There’s a whole lot more on 
how all this works in Crash Course Biology.
Notice how I keep saying usually? That’s 
because some people are born intersex:  
with a blend of male and female traits, because 
of differences in their chromosomes or hormones.
Like, an XX person might have testes, because 
the “grow a pair” gene that’s usually on the Y  
was on the X instead. Or an XY person might 
produce the usual levels of testosterone,  
but have hormone receptors that don’t 
respond to it with typical male development.
There are a lot of different ways someone 
can be intersex! And those paths are more  
common than you think—about seventeen 
in every thousand people are born intersex.
With about eight billion 
people on the planet in 2024, that’s—
carry the two—yeah,
136 million people.
Teen Shan: Wow, that’s more than 
three times the population of Canada!
Wild, huh?
But because there’s this expectation that 
everybody’s got either a penis or a vagina,  
intersex people are often put through 
medically unnecessary surgeries when  
they’re very young so their bodies 
look closer to what’s deemed “normal.”
In any case, sex is only about the body you’re 
born with, not the person you become. It’s  
mostly about the “bits.” But as a society, you 
might say we’re committed to the bits.
We use people’s anatomy to make assumptions about what 
they’re like, or how they’re supposed to act.
And all those socially constructed 
ideas swirling around us? That’s gender.
And gender identity is your 
inner sense of who you are,  
which could be a man, a woman, 
a blend of both, or neither.
If you’re cisgender, your sex, your gender 
identity, and the gender assigned to you  
at birth are the same. But for everyone 
else, things aren’t so straightforward.
A transgender person’s gender 
identity doesn’t match the gender  
they were assigned at birth based on their sex.
For example, they were assigned male 
but identify as a girl. And a nonbinary  
person’s gender identity doesn’t 
fit neatly into either of the boxes,  
so they opt out of the gender binary altogether.
Many nonbinary people also identify as 
transgender, but that’s up to the individual.
For some folks, it takes years—or even decades—to 
recognize and put a name to those feelings.
But for many, gender identity 
starts forming from an early age.
I have a three-year-old who’s very 
curious about anatomy and gender,  
so this conversation comes up a lot in my house.
Which is typical, because by three or four,  
it’s common for both cis and trans kids 
to say “I’m a girl” or “I’m a boy,” and to  
prefer same-gender friends, plus clothes 
and toys stereotypical for their gender.
So even if a trans girl assigned 
“male” at birth is treated like a boy,  
she’s still developing an inner sense of “girl.” 
She’s paying close attention to social messages  
about what girls like and what girls do: messages 
like “only girls wear dresses and love pink.”
But especially if you’re more of a jumpsuit 
gal, or a guy who rocks pink nail polish,  
you’ll know that that message—“only 
girls wear dresses and love pink”—is  
not an objective statement of 
reality. It’s a gender norm:  
a socially constructed idea about how people 
of different genders should look and act.
Gender norms are everywhere, and they can be 
strong. A norm can feel as unquestionable as  
gravity, even if it’s just a thing people 
made up in a certain time and place.
Like, during the 19th century, dresses were 
for anybody under the age of six.
See this cutie in a little sundress? That’s 
future President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
Even the idea that there are 
only two genders — also known  
as a gender binary — is a norm 
that not every culture co-signs.
Many Native American tribes have traditionally 
recognized a third gender, often known by the  
pan-tribal term “Two-Spirit,” for people 
who embody both male and female qualities.
Many Pacific Islander cultures also 
recognize a third gender—like the Māhū  
in Native Hawaiian tradition, 
meaning “the in-between.”
And in Sāmoa, third and fourth gender people 
called fa‘afafine and fa’atama have the special  
role as a family caregiver, including being 
someone who can educate others about sex,  
a topic considered taboo for men 
and women to discuss publicly.
If the idea that there are only two genders feels 
“normal” or “natural,” it might be because that  
idea was deliberately spread for centuries through 
the world’s worst road trip: European colonialism.
While seizing peoples’ land, colonizers 
often suppressed and punished those who  
didn’t align with the two genders 
Europeans thought were correct.
So the idea that there are only two genders is 
just that—an idea that people created to organize  
the world around them. But while putting stuff 
in boxes is great when you’re moving and have  
to separate your nightstand necessities from your 
kitchenware, it usually doesn’t work for people.
So what happens when the box you’re put into 
doesn’t match who you are on the inside?
Some people act on that feeling by going 
through a gender transition—choosing  
to live according to their gender 
identity—which can look like many things.
For some, transitioning might look like 
changing their name or pronouns. For others,  
it might mean switching up their hair, 
their clothes, the way they talk.
[Ash Perez] “I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m 
a hunky dude. And I’m 1 day on T.”
“I’m Ashly Perez, and I’m a hunky 
dude. And I’m 16 weeks on T.”
[Shan] And some transgender 
people—but not all—might  
choose to transition by making 
physical changes to their body.
One pathway for that is gender affirming hormone therapy.  
This might involve things like testosterone or 
estrogen shots, which trigger physical changes  
similar to puberty, so that someone’s body changes 
to be more in line with their gender identity.
Hormone replacement therapy is generally 
only prescribed to people over eighteen—or  
occasionally, someone in their late teens 
who has identified as trans for years,  
with approval from a doctor and their parents.
As for young kids? Before puberty, a trans 
kid’s transition is primarily social,  
including things like their name, 
their pronouns, and their style.
However, as puberty approaches, 
some trans kids might be prescribed  
a different kind of hormone therapy 
medication, called puberty blockers:  
medications that pause the changes 
that don’t align with their gender  
identity — things like facial hair, 
breast development, or a deeper voice.
Puberty blockers have been tested and used 
safely for decades. And their effects are  
temporary—as soon as someone stops 
taking them, puberty revs up again.
Finally, for some people, transitioning 
can involve surgery to their face or body,  
to create more masculine or feminine features 
that better align with their gender identity.
You might hear this called 
“top” or “bottom” surgery,  
when it involves operating on 
someone’s chest or genitals.
These surgeries have been done on people 
of all genders safely for decades — like  
how a cisgender woman might get breast 
reconstruction surgery after a mastectomy.
And although there’s a common 
myth that trans people often  
regret getting gender-affirming surgery, 
research has shown that it’s very rare.
All of these interventions fall under a holistic 
healthcare approach called gender-affirming care,  
which helps folks align their outward 
traits with their inner identity.
In the vast majority of cases, gender-affirming 
care is safe, and it’s backed by decades of  
research and by almost every major 
medical organization in the U.S.,  
including the American Medical Association 
and the American Psychological Association.
Gender-affirming care can also be life-saving, 
since it can help with the distress many trans and  
nonbinary people feel over the mismatch between 
their actual gender and their assigned one.
That’s called gender dysphoria, 
and when it’s not addressed,  
it’s associated with higher-than-average 
rates of mental health conditions and suicide.
That said, receiving support and appropriate 
medical care can mitigate these risks,  
which suggests that the problem 
isn’t being trans—it’s someone  
not being able to live out their gender identity.
So there’s no “one size fits all” 
way to transition. For some people,  
gender-affirming care simply 
means talking to a therapist  
as they navigate transitioning 
in social, non-medical ways.
Trans people have always been 
around, and always will be.
What’s changing is how familiar 
people are with various gender  
identities and terms, how governments 
are collecting data about trans folks,  
and how easily people can connect 
to others with similar identities.
That said, in the U.S., we haven’t 
exactly arrived at the peak of  
empathy and celebrating diverse gender identities.
In 2023 alone, U.S. state legislators proposed—and  
sometimes passed—over five hundred 
anti-trans and anti-LGBTQ+ laws.
But the more accurate information 
is out there, the easier it is to  
base laws and policies on science and 
the lived experiences of trans people.
And of course, honoring someone's gender identity  
by using the name and pronouns they 
choose makes a real difference, too.
That word “transition” might sound like a 
moment [snaps] when somebody becomes who they are.
But transitioning looks different 
for everyone. It can be messy,  
awkward, and meandering. Just 
like gender is for a lot of us.
Because how people experience sex and gender 
is way more dynamic than a couple of boxes.
Next time, we’ll talk about sexual orientation—or 
why we like who we like. See you then.

Is my penis big enough?
Personally I don’t have one, but this 
question—and others like it—have put  
penises in the spotlight since… well, 
before spotlights were even invented.
Ancient civilizations idolized 
them. Early Christians hid them.  
Calvin Klein ads flaunt them. But when 
you turn a body part into a symbol,  
you risk missing out on some 
pretty crucial information.
So what’s the real deal with penises?
Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
Imagine you’re at a massive parade. 
We’re talking floats, marching bands.
And at the end of the procession is 
the part we’ve all been waiting for:  
the arrival of a giant, golden penis?
This was the vibe of festivals in 
ancient Greece that honored the  
wine god Dionysus. Greeks across the 
Athens-metropolitan-area celebrated  
this symbol of fertility with a 
one-night-only hookup extravaganza.
And they weren’t the only 
ones to celebrate penises.
The ancient Egyptians carved their 
gods with larger-than-life erections  
to represent creation. And 
the ancient Romans believed  
a phallus could ward off the “evil eye,” 
so they put them on all sorts of things.
Kinda like me and Frank’s RedHot sauce.
But when Christianity took hold over 
much of the world, the vibe changed,  
and it became more common to see the penis 
as a symbol of evil and sin. In the 1560s,  
the Council of Trent launched a campaign 
to cover up penises with fig leaves.
And many women who were accused of witchcraft 
were actually accused of penis-stealing,  
or having “knowledge of the devil’s penis.”
Hate em or love em, the theme was 
the same: Penises were a big deal.
And to some degree, I totally get it. 
I think penises are fascinating!
Like, it can just get erect without you telling it to.
If you have a penis, you might’ve had 
your first erection before you were born,  
and you could have your last after you die.
You don’t see that happen in zombie movies.
But if we just think of penises as a symbol 
of celebration or sin, we’re missing out on  
learning about actual penises, which are pretty 
amazing. Just not in the parade float kinda way.
Unlike the vulva and vagina, we’ve known 
how penises work for a long time. At least,  
once we got past the idea that 
erect penises were just full of air.
Early thinkers were pretty fascinated 
by the D, including Leonardo da Vinci.
Near the end of the 15th century, 
he dissected human cadavers and drew  
elaborate sketches of the penis structure, 
becoming the first to note that erections  
are not caused by air, but by 
increased blood flow to the penis.
And since da Vinci’s day, our knowledge of the 
penis has… kept on growing.
So let’s get into it. 
While the vulva has different holes 
for peeing and sex, the penis has  
just one small hole at the end of it. It’s 
called the meatus (nope, I am not joking),  
and it’s the exit for both urine and semen—the 
fluid that comes out when a person ejaculates.
While pee has a relatively straight 
shot from the bladder out of the body,  
semen takes… more of a scenic route.
After being formed in the testicles, mature 
sperm travels from a duct called the epididymis  
through a crazy-straw looking tube called 
the vas deferens, and eventually into  
another tube called the urethra, before it’s 
shot out from the meatus during ejaculation.
And if the penis pulling 
double-duty makes you think,  
“Uh, Shan, doesn’t that mean I 
might pee during sex?” Don’t worry.
During arousal, the muscles in the 
internal urethral sphincter contract,  
presumably to keep that very thing from happening.
Now, as for semen — you might 
assume it’s mostly made of sperm,  
but sperm is only two to five 
percent of total semen volume.
The rest is its entourage of nutrients 
and carrier liquid that keep the sperm  
alive and wriggling, and help defend them 
against the natural acidity of the vagina.
For a full anatomy lesson, you can check 
out Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology.
But even if you can label a penis diagram 
with your eyes closed, there’s more to it  
than just the bits and bobs. So, let’s grab 
some questions from the Intimate Inbox.
Oh here’s a good one… “Why do I get 
an erection while I’m sleeping?”
Right, so, the penis is mostly 
made of a specialized kind of  
tissue with tons of tiny blood vessels in it.
When blood flow increases, the penis swells, just 
like how a sponge swells when it's full of water.
And while this increase in blood 
flow can happen when you’re aroused,  
it can also happen for seemingly no reason 
at all, including when you’re asleep.
Overnight, your body regulates itself 
and its blood flow. Other than that,  
researchers still don’t fully understand why 
erections happen during sleep — or how often.
Alright, let’s see if I have another one here…
“Is it possible to break my penis? I’m 
SO SCARED of breaking my penis.”
Well, I have some great news for you. 
Even though we use the word “boner”  
to refer to an erect penis, the human 
penis doesn’t actually have any bones.
That said, if a penis is forcefully bent while 
it’s erect, the spongy tissue can rupture  
and tear, which can cause lots of pain 
and needs immediate medical attention.
This is called a penis fracture, but I 
can’t stress enough that this is not a  
common outcome of sex or masturbation, so it’s 
not something to lose sleep, or pleasure, over.
Okay, here’s a question from a non-penis-haver. 
“When I don’t want to have sex after making out,  
my boyfriend says he has blue 
balls. What does that mean?”
I’m so glad you asked this question. 
The penis isn’t the only organ that  
can swell during arousal. Blood flow to 
the entire genital area is increased,  
including to the testicles, to 
help move semen to the urethra.
So if someone gets aroused but doesn’t ejaculate, 
it can cause a temporary buildup of blood in the  
testicles, which can feel uncomfortable. Fun 
fact: the same thing goes for the clitoris!
But unless that erection lasts for more 
than four hours, which actually is a  
sign of a medical condition, “blue 
balls” aren’t in any way dangerous.
Ejaculating or just waiting for the 
arousal to subside will bring relief.  
And if your partner has blue balls, that 
isn’t something you have to help them with.
Ok. [Shan rustling papers]
Well, it looks like all the other questions  
in here are all just the same 
question: “Is my penis normal?”
And the short answer to that is… probably? 
I mean, I’m not a doctor. But probably!
If it ever feels like people make a huge 
deal out of penis size, you’re right.
In general, Western societies have tended to 
associate bigger penises with masculinity,  
fertility, wealth, confidence — all sorts of 
things that have nothing to do with the actual  
size of someone’s genitals, but can do a great job 
at making someone feel insecure about themselves.
Again with the useless symbolism!
So let’s cut to the chase. The best 
estimates we have for average penis  
size come from a 2023 paper that analyzed 
seventy-five studies and included over  
fifty-five thousand measurements from 
different populations around the world.
These were the results: an average flaccid length  
of 3.4 inches and an average 
erect length of 5.5 inches.
As for girth, or circumference, 
another large study found an average  
flaccid girth of 3.7 inches, and an 
average erect girth of 4.6 inches.
Before you whip out the measuring tape, here’s 
the thing: an average is just an average.
There’s a significant range on either side of that 
middle number that’s considered “normal.”
Plus, research shows that folks with penises are 
the ones who assign size the most importance.
One study showed that eight-five percent of 
women were satisfied with the size of their  
partner’s penis, while only fifty-five percent 
of men were happy with what they had goin’ on.
And in most cases, penis size is 
pretty unrelated to sexual performance.
Outside of size, there’s a lot of variation 
to penises. Most are darker than the rest of  
the body and have one tone on the 
shaft and one tone on the head.
Some have visible veins,
and some penises are straight while others have a 
slight curve to them—up, down or to either side.
And then there’s circumcision. You may 
have heard the words “cut” and “uncut”  
used to describe circumcised 
and uncircumcised penises.
That’s because circumcision, typically 
performed at birth, is a surgery that  
removes the layer of skin covering the 
end of the penis, called the foreskin.
Folks have been performing 
circumcisions since ancient times,  
and it’s arguably still the most 
common surgery performed today.
Circumcision is chosen for all sorts 
of reasons, often as part of cultural  
or religious traditions. And it’s 
become the norm in some places,  
like the U.S. While it’s definitely not 
the norm in other places, like the UK.
It’s hard to say exactly why this is, but it 
could’ve become cemented in the U.S. healthcare  
system and culture over time, possibly as a 
holdover from puritanical attitudes toward sex.
Puritans used to see circumcision 
as a cure for masturbation,  
which they considered unhealthy and sinful.
And you might be thinking, “But Shan, isn’t 
circumcision more hygienic?”
Well, the jury’s out on that one. 
Most healthcare experts agree that 
there are some minimal benefits and some minimal  
risks associated with circumcision—not 
enough to firmly recommend either way.
In either case, hygiene is a must. The best way 
to clean your penis is to pull back the foreskin  
all the way—if there is any—and wash thoroughly 
but gently with your fingers and warm water.
You can also use a gentle, unscented soap.
So there you have it. Penises might have been 
the stuff of legend for much of human history,  
but take away all the symbolism, and it turns out 
they’re just a really cool part of the human body.
This is just the start of our foray into penises.  
We’ll be talking more about them—and 
other sex organs—in future episodes.
Speaking of, next time, we’ll talk about 
what it means to transition. See you then.

WtfOaS_qZrM,"Are my labia too long? Does my vagina smell 
bad? Am I supposed to be shaving my pubic hair?
These are just a few of the questions 
I hear every day as a sex educator.
The vulva and the vagina can feel like they’re 
shrouded in mystery. So let’s change that!
Because from the superstar clitoris to 
the billions of microorganisms hanging  
out in vaginas, there’s a whole lot 
of amazing stuff going on down there.
Hi! I’m Shan Boodram, and 
this is Crash Course Sex Ed.
[THEME MUSIC]
You know how when someone makes a penis 
joke, it’s usually lighthearted and funny, 
but then you go talking about vulvas and 
suddenly you’re getting a weird side eye?
No? Just me?
Here’s what I’m getting at: what’s considered 
“female anatomy” can be tangled up with shame.
Take the word “pudendum.” It’s a medical 
term for genitals that usually refers to  
the Vulva & Associates, and it comes from 
a Latin word that means “to be ashamed.”
And that matters.
Not just because we’re stigmatizing anatomy 
that roughly half the population has,  
but also because studies have shown that 
people who felt bad about their vulva and  
vagina were less likely to enjoy sex, or 
seek medical care when they needed it.
This shame has also influenced how 
much we know about the vagina and co.
Most of our modern understanding 
of sexual anatomy has been shaped  
by centuries of male-dominated thinking 
and research—much of which was conducted  
without the input of women, or 
anyone who wasn’t a cisgender man.
Even a bunch of female organs are named after 
the male scientists who “discovered” them. Like,  
Fallopian tubes? Named after Gabriele 
Falloppio, who famously, didn’t have any.
Here’s the deal, labias and genitals: the 
better we understand how all bodies work,  
the better off we are. So, let’s get into it.
First things first: all this is not the vagina.
Everything you can see from 
the outside is the vulva.
The technical term for this area 
above the vulva is the mons pubis.
These two outer lips are the labia majora. Then  
you have the inner lips—the labia 
minora—and within them, two holes.
This teeny one at the end of the urethra is the 
urethral opening, which is where urine comes out,  
and this middle one down here is the vaginal 
opening, which is the doorway to the vagina.
The vagina is that inner canal beyond the 
vaginal opening… and that’s it.
Vulva, external; vagina, internal.
When there’s nothing inside a vagina, 
it’s more of a flat envelope than a  
gaping tunnel. It’s an average 
of just over two inches long.
But during arousal? It can expand  
up to eight inches… to make room for 
whatever it is you’ve got going on.
Meanwhile, on the outside, the 
vulva extends all the way down here.
This space of delicate tissue between the vaginal 
opening and the anus is called the perineum.
You can learn more about these parts 
in Crash Course Anatomy & Physiology.
But for now, let me introduce you 
to this superstar: the clitoris.
It’s tucked under the clittoral hood, 
but don’t let its size fool you.
The part that we can see is 
just the tip of the iceberg.
The clitoris is actually a large, 
complex structure that extends inside the pelvic cavity,  
and it’s made up of the same kind of 
spongy erectile tissue as the penis.
Its full structure wasn’t uncovered 
until 2005—and this time, by a woman:  
Australian urologist Helen O’Connell.
Keep in mind, the penis was fully 
anatomically described as early as 35 BCE,  
so the clitoris has been waiting 
a long time for the spotlight.
The clitoris has over 10,000 nerve 
endings, and one of its main purposes  
is sexual pleasure, hence the superstar status.
We’ll talk more about it in future episodes.
But for now, let’s answer some questions 
from the Intimate Inbox. I’ll do the honors.
Alright, the first question… “My 
vulva doesn’t look like the one  
on the poster in my health class. 
Is there something wrong with it?”
You know what? Most people’s 
vulvas do not look like that.
The inner lips can be longer than the outer lips.  
Both sets of labia can be 
different sizes or lengths.
Your pubic hair can be bushy 
, wispy, curly, or straight.
Your clitoris might be smaller or larger,
and all of this diversity—as long as you’re  
not in pain or something’s affecting 
your quality of life—is normal.
You might trim, shave, or wax your pubic hair  
for personal comfort or for 
intimacy, or you might not!
There’s no right way to landscape your 
lawn, if you know what I’m saying.
Alright, here’s another one. “Why is my 
skin down there darker than the rest of me?”
That’s totally normal, too!
Everyone’s skin has melanin in it, 
the pigment that gives skin its color.
Around your genitals, these pigment-producing 
cells are super sensitive to hormones,  
and our hormones are really active in these areas.
When the two interact, they create 
more pigment. Simple as that.
“What’s with all the wetness?”
You might have heard that when 
someone with a vulva gets aroused,  
they get “wet.” And that’s true!
During sexual arousal more 
blood flows to the genital area.
That makes these two little glands here and these  
two little glands here release fluid 
to lubricate the vaginal opening.
Think of it as a natural lube. 
Fluid decreases friction,  
and just generally makes it easier for 
things to slide in and out of the vagina.
But listen, vaginas get wet 
for all sorts of reasons.
One of the most common ones? The big D: discharge.
If you’ve ever looked in your 
underwear and been like, “Uhhhhh,  
what is that?” it’s probably discharge, 
which is the vagina’s wash cycle.
The vagina cleans itself by shedding old cells,  
and it keeps the tissue healthy 
and protected with moisture.
Vaginas produce around a half to a full 
teaspoon of discharge every day, but the  
fluid and the amount of it varies from person 
to person and throughout the menstrual cycle.
Some of that discharge is from the 
glands we talked about earlier,  
but some is also produced by the cervix: 
where the vagina ends and the uterus begins.
Really, though, the only time you 
should worry about discharge is  
if it’s different from your normal 
— like if it’s green-ish or foamy,  
has blood in it when it’s not 
your period, or smells off.
In those cases, do consider 
talking to your doctor.
“Sometimes my discharge smells…not 
bad, but kinda funky. Why is that?”
Great question! To find out, let’s 
take a trip… inside the vagina.
Believe it or not, everyone’s 
genitals are covered in microbes,  
including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. But 
don’t panic— that’s actually a good thing!
The vagina is home to its own magnificent 
world of microorganisms, mostly bacteria,  
and they’re an essential part of 
keeping things safe and healthy.
This invisible community is 
called the vaginal microbiome.
Now, the research into all of this is pretty 
new, so there’s still a lot that we don’t know.
And many studies have largely 
focused on white, Western women,  
though new research shows that the makeup of 
the vaginal microbiome varies by ethnicity.
But here’s what we do know:
The typical vaginal microbiome is mostly made 
up of a kind of bacteria called Lactobacillus.
It’s the same genus of bacteria 
that’s found in yogurt and cheese,  
but it’s not the exact same species.
These bacteria produce lactic acid,  
which keeps the vaginal environment 
on the acidic end of things.
Now, if you’ve ever noticed that 
the crotch of your underwear  
wears out fast and gets bleached, 
that’s because of the lactic acid.
The vagina is usually between 
a 3.8 and a 5 on the pH scale,  
which puts it somewhere between the 
acidity of wine vinegar and cucumbers.
This keeps yeast and other kinds 
of local bacteria in check.
Okay, back to the smell question. 
Everyone, especially people with vaginas,  
face a lot of social pressure 
to look and smell a certain way.
How stuff smells down there depends 
on what’s going on with the vaginal  
microbiome, which is heavily affected by hormones.
Both semen and menstrual blood can 
also throw off the vagina’s pH,  
because they’re more basic. Meaning “the opposite 
of acidic,” not like, pumpkin spice latte basic.
That said, if things smell fishy down there?  
That could be a sign that the 
microbiome is out of balance.
But here’s the great news:
While vulvas benefit from a nice wash with 
warm water, vaginas are self-cleaning.
You never need to use soap or any other 
kind of cleaning product inside your vagina.
It’s cliterally bad for you, because your pH 
can be thrown off if you disturb it too much.
And, when the microbiome is out of whack, that can 
lead to inflammation, discomfort, and pain.
Overall, just like with discharge, the 
only time you should worry about how  
your vagina smells is if it’s 
different from your normal.
Vulvas, vaginas, and everything that 
goes with them are pretty amazing.
And they’re worth talking about and 
studying so that we can understand  
them just like any other part of the human body.
And when it comes to what’s normal?
If you have a vulva, the most important 
thing is learning what’s normal for you,  
to keep your body healthy, 
safe, and feelin’ in flow.
Next time, we’re turning the 
spotlight on penises. See you then.
