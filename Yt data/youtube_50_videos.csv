a7nJeXk6VxU,Vibe coding and context engineering with ADK,"Go from an empty folder to a fully deployed AI agent using only natural language. This video introduces ""vibe coding,"" a powerful technique to build applications from scratch using the Gemini CLI.

Follow along with Sita and Amit as they demonstrate how to scaffold a new AI agent with the Agent Development Kit (ADK) in plain English. You'll then learn ""Context Engineering,"" the secret sauce for moving your agent from a prototype to production. See how to provide documentation, coding standards, and feature requirements to guide the AI in generating high-quality, maintainable code.

Finally, watch as they deploy the entire agent to Google Cloud Run with a single command.

Stick around for the ""Eng Talk"" segment, where Amit and Sita answer top community questions:
- Is RAG obsolete with million-token context windows?
- How do you manage context overload?
- What metrics should you use to track context retrieval?
- What are the best tips for token optimization?

9oYHU1hdDog,"Agents, AI & The Next Wave: Mike Clark on Vertex AI at DevFest Silicon Valley","AI just reset the developer playbook. In this DevFest Silicon Valley sit-down, Mike Clark (Google's Director of Product Management, AI Agents) sits down with Frank (Puf) Van Puffelen (Google Developer Expert and Engineer), sharing how agents are moving from demos to production with Vertex AI Agent Builder, Agent Engine, and the open-source Agent Developer Kit (SDK). They also discuss what “build → scale → govern” means for real teams.

In this video we cover: 
* Why AI is finally accessible (and why community matters) 
* “Outcomes over lines of code” and the new definition of quality 
* Citizen developers, vibe coding, and what pros should build next 
* Continuous PRs, observability, OpenTelemetry, and open agent protocols (A2A, A2UI) 
* Practical entry points, prebuilt agents, and deployment choices (Cloud Run, GKE, etc.)

TL;DR: Stay curious. Start small. Ship agents with guardrails.
