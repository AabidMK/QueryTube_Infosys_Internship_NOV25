Sl7fGRiShjg,Inside the 1965 War: Col Ravel Singh’s Untold Battlefield Truth — From Mandi Operation to OP Hill,"Step into the real 1965 Indo–Pakistan War — not the textbook version, but the raw, unfiltered ground reality lived by Lt Col Ravel Singh, one of the bravest officers of the Sikh Regiment.

In this exclusive episode, Lt Col Ravel Singh takes us through the intense battles of Poonch, Mandi, Mendhar and OP Hill, where every decision meant life or death.

From infiltrators entering Indian villages, to Mandi town being minutes away from destruction, to the moment an entire civilian population had to be rescued under direct fire — this conversation captures the true chaos, courage and strategy of war.

Hear the unbelievable story of how:
500 mortar rounds were fired to break enemy positions and save Mandi town
Pakistani infiltrators reached inside the civilian zone
A young officer chose to walk into danger rather than away from it
Communication failures and lack of reinforcements changed the course of operations
One officer survived 7 days of continuous Pakistani firing with no food, no water and no artillery support
OP Hill turned into one of the most brutal and decisive engagements of the 1965 war
Civilians, soldiers and officers fought side-by-side against overwhelming odds

Lt Col Ravel Singh also reveals:
What actually happens in close-range firefights
How battlefield leadership saves (or costs) lives
The mindset of infiltrators and the reality of hand-to-hand combat
Untold stories of bravery, loss and sacrifice

Decisions that shaped an entire warfront — and remained unheard for decades

This is not a scripted war story.
This is Lt Col Ravel Singh’s truth — a soldier’s memory, preserved exactly as it happened.

FioDiCD3y6s,Inside Operation Rainbow: How 21 Para SF Eliminated 13 Militants & Averted a Deadly Ambush,"In this episode, we uncover the real story behind Operation Rainbow and Operation Swift Strike, two of the most decisive missions executed by 21 Para Special Forces in Manipur.

From entering a hostile insurgency zone to building a secret intelligence network with local boys, surrendered militants, and villagers — this episode shows how the unit slowly turned the battleground in their favour.

But they were militants.
This single operation resulted in 12–13 militants eliminated, making it one of the most successful SF missions in the region.

Why This Episode Matters

How a CO builds fearless teams that refuse to return without success

How young soldiers executed missions that changed the course of insurgency operations

This is the real 21 Para SF — courage, clarity, and unmatched instinct in the face of da

yg10MsFjy7s,"21 PARA SF Legend: Col Mandeep Singh Mann | Inside Op Pawan, Jaffna & India’s Hidden Operations","Step into the untold world of 21 PARA Special Forces with the legendary Col Mandeep Singh Mann, a man remembered by his unit “like a God” for his leadership, courage, and battlefield mastery.

In this powerful episode, we uncover stories that have never been told on camera—stories from Op Pawan, the brutal battles of Jaffna, encounters with the LTTE, and India’s most dangerous hidden operations across the Northeast and Kashmir.

From the failed heliborne assault in Sri Lanka, where an entire team was trapped under heavy fire…
to the horrifying night when 30 Indian soldiers were captured and burned alive,
to the transformation of 21 PARA SF into one of the most feared units in the Indian Army—
this conversation reveals the raw, real face of military operations few civilians ever get to hear.

Col Mann takes us through:
• The truth of Op Pawan and what really happened in Jaffna
• How LTTE became one of the deadliest insurgent groups in the world
• Insane battlefield stories of courage, survival & sacrifice
• How Special Forces think, train, and operate behind enemy lines
• Leadership lessons that shaped generations of Para Commandos
• Inside operations in Sri Lanka, Manipur, Nagaland, Kashmir & more
• The mindset you need to lead men into war—and bring them back

This episode is not just a military conversation—
It is a journey through history, sacrifice, warfare, and the spirit of Indian Special Forces.

Jai Hind.

XYmS7P9sNyY,Honoured to begin our SSB mentorship journey with Lt Col Ankur Sabharwal.,"Over the years, countless people approached us to start SSB mentoring. But we always believed that SSB preparation requires far more than the Special Forces mindset. It demands technical understanding, structured processes, and deep insight into the assessment system—areas where we felt the right expertise was essential. With Ankur Sir on board, we finally feel we have that complete team.

A stalwart in the field, he has served as a GTO and later as an instructor at DIPR, training the very officers who go on to assess candidates across multiple SSBs. He has facilitated more than 500 recommendations, and his team has mentored nearly 800 aspirants for various armed forces entries in the last year alone.

Together, we are ready to transform lives, shape futures, and guide the next generation of military leaders.

A new mission begins.

bET_jqPvmz8,Delhi Bl@st Analysis | Former NSG Force Commander & FB!-Trained !ED Specialist Explains,"In this exclusive and powerful episode of Monks and Warriors, we sit down with Brigadier Gautam Ganguly, SM, VSM — Former Force Commander, NSG, to decode the truth behind the recent Delhi Bl@st inc!dent that left the entire nation in shock.

Brig Ganguly, one of India’s most respected c0unter-ops specialists, shares his first-hand professional insight into how such incidents are planned, how our agencies respond, and what really goes on behind the scenes when a city like Delhi faces a major secur!ty scare.

🎯 In this episode, you’ll learn about:
What exactly happened near the Red Fort area
How the quick action of secur!ty agencies prevented a massive tr@gedy
The structure and working of hidden sleeper n@tworks within India
Why modern terr0r methods are becoming more psychological than physical
How coordination between NSG, Police, and Intelligence Units works on the ground
Why citizen alertness and situational awareness are now India’s strongest defence

This conversation is not meant to create fear — it’s meant to create awareness and clarity.
As Brig Ganguly says, “The battle against viol@nt ideologies is not fought only with weapons, but with intelligence, unity, and vigilance.”

🙏 A heartfelt salute to every soldier, officer, and intelligence professional who stands as India’s first line of defence.
This episode is our small tribute to their courage, sacrifice, and commitment to peace.

📺 Watch the full conversation to understand how national security really functions — and why every citizen has a role to play.

vonJIl6kmFQ,Battle of Dograi | 3 JAT’s Historic Victory Just 13 KM from Lahore | 1965 Indo-Pak War,"On the night of 21–22 September 1965, the Indian Army’s 3 JAT Battalion, commanded by Lt Col Desmond Hayde, scripted one of the most extraordinary chapters of the Indo–Pak War of 1965 — the Battle of Dograi.

Facing heavy artillery fire, tank assaults, and fortified bunkers, the brave soldiers of 3 JAT launched a daring attack across the Ichhogil Canal, Pakistan’s key defensive line protecting Lahore. Fighting house-to-house and bunker-to-bunker, they captured Dograi village, just 13 kilometres from Lahore, in one of the fiercest close-quarter battles ever fought by the Indian Army.

This victory came at a heavy cost — with many gallant soldiers making the supreme sacrifice. But the courage, discipline, and determination displayed by the JAT Regiment turned Dograi into a symbol of Indian military valour.

Even decades later, the Battle of Dograi remains a global military case study on leadership, tactical brilliance, and raw courage.
